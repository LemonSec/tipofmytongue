1
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:22,800
so my Talk's going to be about emulating

2
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,140
adversaries and the business

3
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,840
um Auditors uh that may have caught your

4
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,160
attention a little bit

5
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,240
um I don't think it's that of an

6
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,640
exciting topic but I'm going to try and

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,260
motivate at least the purpose of

8
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,440
auditing and um how you can use it to

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,180
the basic audit principles and how you

10
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,260
could use it to incorporate with your

11
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,899
purple team testing and also how you can

12
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:44,879
start emulating adversaries

13
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,860
um so after a lunchtime talk I know

14
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,840
maybe the title Auditors is not that

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,579
enticing but essentially everything in

16
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,800
offensive security we can think of it as

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,899
quality assurance almost and I'm going

18
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:56,160
to try and convince you in the next 40

19
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,899
minutes or so that everything we

20
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:59,399
typically do in offensive security

21
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:00,719
whether it be trying to emulate

22
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,940
adversaries is really about

23
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,780
auditing

24
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,119
so a little bit about my who am I I'm a

25
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,100
senior penetration tester who started

26
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,840
falling in love with threat emulation

27
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,760
and uh purple teaming in general and

28
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,500
I'll get to that just a little bit but I

29
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,880
first want to thank the organizers of

30
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,580
Circle City without Community Resources

31
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,040
and anything like that that might this

32
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,960
talk wouldn't even be possible I

33
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,460
wouldn't be able to give this type of

34
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,320
presentation especially with the

35
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,740
resources that um went into uh making uh

36
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,240
purple teaming in general there's a lot

37
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,860
of great open source tooling that we'll

38
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,000
get into and how you can actually use

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,439
that to your benefit if you're looking

40
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,360
to emulate adversaries

41
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,520
I originally started as an I.T auditor

42
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,259
so that's essentially where that

43
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:45,299
motivation also comes in where I learned

44
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:47,579
initially how to carry out all the

45
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:49,259
exercises everything in it network

46
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:52,439
security Etc I'm also part of a newly

47
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,420
deployed team we're called then secure

48
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,820
wolf and Company we're around so if you

49
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,439
want to chat um you can find us later

50
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,659
and we're also hiring so definitely come

51
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,399
talk if you're interested

52
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,320
my background's also in mathematics for

53
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,520
what it's worth

54
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,840
um I remember when I was sitting in

55
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,060
undergrad college classes we always used

56
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,400
to motivate problems so I'll get into at

57
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,420
least highlighting and demonstrating

58
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,620
what I'm actually going to talk about

59
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,700
just a little bit

60
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,860
so the agenda um the first step that I

61
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,000
want to talk about is the miter attack

62
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,840
problem

63
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,640
um that's a little bit over the top and

64
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,080
I'll get to explain what that really

65
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,940
means but I just like I said I just want

66
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,220
to start motivating exactly how we got

67
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,660
to the miter type problem I'll call it

68
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,520
and at least how to make it actionable

69
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,140
so we can actually use in our internal

70
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,000
networks as we're measuring defenses

71
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,340
using those basic audit principles I

72
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,260
also just do a brief primer about what

73
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,300
auditing really is about and why

74
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,099
um I'm trying to link the two between

75
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:46,620
offensive security and auditing and also

76
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,900
give a primer between cyber security

77
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,940
Frameworks and how you can you leverage

78
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,920
that discussion or understanding of

79
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,420
Frameworks and incorporate it into the

80
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,860
business as well

81
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,480
and then finally

82
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,860
um I'll go into the actual tooling that

83
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,360
exists out there that way we can

84
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,800
actually incorporate these types of

85
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,800
tests um cheaply and effectively I'll

86
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,480
start going through the most basic and

87
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,220
simple exercises you can form which is

88
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,819
now known as Atomic Testing um I like to

89
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:13,739
refer to that as unit testing again the

90
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:15,300
quality assurance instead of nine of

91
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,920
measuring your defenses

92
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,140
micro emulation that's actually new so

93
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,480
on Thursday miter Ingenuity they

94
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,180
actually just published a new type of

95
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,220
plan that you can make which is referred

96
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,420
to as macro emulation it's really

97
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,940
exciting because that lowers the barrier

98
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,459
of entry for a lot of organizations

99
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:33,959
um and I'll get to a little bit about

100
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:35,760
that as well and then I'll have some

101
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,159
demos quickly just to kind of showcase

102
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,360
how this all works in the background

103
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,400
especially if this is a new topic for

104
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,379
any of you or if even if you're an

105
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:44,879
offensive security if you do pen tests

106
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,140
or any types of red team type of

107
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,120
engagements I think really in the future

108
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,280
as penetration testing or offensive

109
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,040
security engagements start to evolve I

110
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,480
think this is going to be the next uh

111
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,940
the next big thing

112
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,400
so I have my obligatory pyramid slide if

113
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,140
this is new to you on the left hand side

114
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,659
we have David bianco's uh pyramid that

115
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:05,819
was produced in 2013.

116
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:07,440
um it's an obligatory pyramid slide

117
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,640
because every time we talk about Minor

118
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,739
attack we like to uh bring up the

119
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:12,180
Pyramid of pain

120
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,280
um the top is really the most important

121
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,079
part at least for the left uh hand side

122
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,180
the way you can think about the pyramid

123
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,639
and where miter attack really came from

124
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:22,620
is when we're defending when we think

125
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,419
about Defenders we classically were

126
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:26,340
thinking about that kill chain the Cyber

127
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,740
kill chain of What actors are doing

128
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,120
um for their objectives they're doing

129
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,040
reconnaissance they're enumerating uh

130
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,840
things in the network they're escalating

131
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,160
privileges and then demonstrating some

132
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,500
sort of impact that's all true but at

133
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,419
least from a defensive perspective this

134
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:41,940
pyramid of pain really explained why

135
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,000
defense is really difficult so as an

136
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,560
offensive security minor individual our

137
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,300
goal is to always try to help the blue

138
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,280
team and sometimes we get carried away

139
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,400
at least from the red team side where we

140
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,139
get really excited about doing really

141
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:57,540
flashy things we get domain admin but

142
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,460
trivia there's some really simple things

143
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,320
as we commonly heard in the news in the

144
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,320
past couple days that still work and the

145
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,479
behavior part of an actor is the most

146
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,240
difficult part to detect but is going to

147
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,460
return the the highest in terms of

148
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,100
security impact for your organization

149
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,139
um the bottom is Hash values you can

150
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:17,460
kind of figure out what the with other

151
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,600
pieces if the first time you're seeing

152
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,699
it but for example if I went to virus

153
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:22,199
total and just downloaded the malware

154
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,820
sample or something like that that's

155
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,520
very easy for Defenders to detect on but

156
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,080
it's also very easy for an attacker

157
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,479
perspective to change and modify but for

158
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,360
behaviors I like drinking coffee so

159
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,820
whenever I go to Starbucks or Duncan I'm

160
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,400
going to get a shot of espresso

161
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,360
um and all of a sudden if you remove

162
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,400
that so if you're targeting my behaviors

163
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,680
of removing my caffeine intake I'm gonna

164
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,360
have to start figuring out different

165
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,820
ways of accomplishing objective and you

166
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,780
can start thinking about that a little

167
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,240
bit for adversary actions as well

168
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,340
the pyramid on the right is somewhat new

169
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,800
it's from Scythe Scythe is a purple team

170
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,080
framework I'm going to refer to a lot of

171
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,300
different Community Resources um Scythe

172
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,699
being one of them they make a command

173
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:04,560
and control platform to carry out purple

174
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,840
team exercises the reason I have this

175
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,120
new slide um that was developed by Chris

176
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,060
Peacock is because at the very top is

177
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,800
procedure data so similarly at the top

178
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,000
is the most important part of the

179
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,160
Pyramid of pain procedure data from the

180
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,560
miter attack framework is the most

181
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,120
important thing to carry out because

182
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,380
minor attack is really just a

183
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,759
classification scheme that's the first

184
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,380
time you're hearing it I'll go into the

185
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,819
actual framework and how it really is

186
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,860
laid out at least the Enterprise one but

187
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,900
think about procedures meaning actions

188
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,639
so physically on the command line What

189
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,100
actors are actually doing and we'll get

190
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,060
into that in just a moment

191
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,600
um I don't know what is going with all

192
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,280
the pyramids though we kind of have this

193
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,900
pyramid of scheme problem I'm not sure

194
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,180
why uh a lot of the purple Team guys we

195
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,340
keep on making new pyramids um trying

196
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,080
not to motivate the in the businesses

197
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,699
you're talking to Executives because you

198
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:52,620
know you can run into

199
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,780
um a nice problem obviously

200
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,520
so why auditing why am I talking about

201
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,560
auditing and trying to link that between

202
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,780
offensive security that's because

203
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,400
businesses most likely already

204
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,020
understand what auditing is that's

205
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,360
already a measure that they're used to

206
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,039
if you're in an organization you're

207
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:09,479
probably getting audited especially a

208
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:12,360
public One stock auditing uh cyber

209
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,639
security audits its audits are almost

210
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,979
endless in organizations and they're

211
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:19,139
very used to at least understanding what

212
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:20,340
an audit is

213
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,080
that's not true for offensive testing

214
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,460
though because we still don't have a

215
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,720
Common Language between How We Do

216
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,340
penetration tests

217
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,840
um in some cases how that's evolved

218
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,580
through the past decade or so is

219
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,780
traditionally we would run a

220
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,120
vulnerability scan we'd identify

221
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,680
vulnerabilities and we try to exploit

222
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,180
them and that's evolved slowly over time

223
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,979
where now people are focusing on

224
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:39,840
premises like the directory there's new

225
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,340
offensive capabilities to carry out

226
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,080
those exercises but we still have that

227
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,400
running theme where not enough

228
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,960
organizations are either doing that

229
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,180
offensive security testing or the

230
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,180
quality or production of those tests is

231
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,680
there's no common language of what

232
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,240
actually means we've seen reports for

233
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,639
example of a vulnerability scan and that

234
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,680
gets handed off as a pen test there's a

235
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,000
kind of this reoccurring theme versus

236
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,979
auditing businesses kind of know how

237
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:02,940
that's structured and how that's

238
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,740
supposed to work so if we use that

239
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,759
common language of at least

240
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:06,960
incorporating our offensive security

241
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,360
test in a style of an audit There's real

242
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,940
return on that and not only that

243
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,319
Regulators or other Auditors are going

244
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:15,180
to start doing these types of tests I've

245
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,620
already seen it happen where Regulators

246
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,060
are asking for these types of tests to

247
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,160
happen and if that's the case we want to

248
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,539
make sure our Auditors are not just

249
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:23,699
college educated graduate students which

250
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:25,139
is oftentimes the case they're going off

251
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:27,060
their checklist of just a word document

252
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,220
and they're performing an audit we want

253
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,660
to make sure this technical capabilities

254
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,458
and knowledge and that's not a skill Gap

255
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,260
that's more of we want to make sure that

256
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,458
people are understanding how to actually

257
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,320
leverage these Frameworks and not just

258
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,580
carrying out these exercises just

259
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,520
because someone else told them to

260
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,559
um but basic audit principles uh are

261
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,480
really the three bullets here so we want

262
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,680
to measure the effectiveness of the

263
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,779
control meaning that if we have an EDR

264
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,339
if we have a SIM so if we're really

265
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:51,839
talking about the internal Network or

266
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,060
the totality of the entire internal

267
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,160
Network we're considering what we

268
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,480
actually want to measure

269
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,820
we create repeatable test cases meaning

270
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,399
that if I perform an action so if I want

271
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,959
to emulate an address rate I want to do

272
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:06,600
ransomware I want to do a very basic

273
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,540
Discovery exercise of I've found this

274
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,160
very interesting threat actor that may

275
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,320
be impacting my industry I know they do

276
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,200
this step of actions for discovery

277
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,480
I should be able to make creatable uh

278
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,100
create repeatable processes so that

279
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,899
anyone can incorporate that test in the

280
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:23,880
future especially if it if it failed or

281
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,680
my assumptions were not validated

282
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,140
uh finally it's determining the overall

283
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,700
confidence we're never going to be 100

284
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,620
sure that we're going to be able to

285
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,300
prevent phishing right so fishing are

286
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,339
types of exercises that we do to train

287
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:36,899
our end users

288
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:38,339
um obviously there's strong opinions of

289
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:40,680
how effective fishing obviously is but

290
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,240
we're never going to obviously end just

291
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,560
stopping doing phishing training or

292
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,240
anything like that right we always have

293
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,399
some sort of confidence or degree of

294
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:49,800
variability of how well we think control

295
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,060
actually is working and operating

296
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,580
um so I mentioned uh I I've seen

297
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,980
regulators and other Auditors start to

298
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,720
try and incorporate these types of tests

299
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,920
and I think it's really important to

300
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,779
start having a conversation of how to

301
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:05,580
effectively use matter attack and

302
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,440
perform these test cases that way we

303
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,700
don't run into that previous problem

304
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,959
that I was mentioning with penetration

305
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:12,240
testing um if I talk to someone else

306
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,160
what is a pen test to them we're

307
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,600
probably going to run into the two

308
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,740
different complete type of tests

309
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,839
unfortunately so I want to make sure at

310
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:21,000
least if you take anything away from

311
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,800
this talk making sure if you are an

312
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,420
auditor or if they want to think like an

313
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,339
auditor we go through this uh

314
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:27,779
methodology

315
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:30,240
um simply first we start simple and easy

316
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,580
and we can slowly evolve it over time

317
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,220
and make it better

318
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,660
so validating an assumptions is the most

319
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,300
important part because we are probably

320
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,680
one of the only Industries or in

321
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,320
technology where we constantly throw

322
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,700
hundreds of thousands of dollars in

323
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,700
Solutions and uh the only time they

324
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,200
really get tested is through a breach

325
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,940
maybe they get tested from a penetration

326
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,079
test but that's never really the

327
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,459
objective of pen test it's just maybe

328
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:56,640
could happen I commonly hear some folks

329
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,560
on our team or other teams from a red

330
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,019
team are they'll say oh I bypass DDR I

331
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:03,480
was able to dump Elsas I open up task

332
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,180
manager and I dumped lsas and I got all

333
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,579
the creds and then we never really go

334
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:10,320
back during the pen test to say why did

335
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,700
that happen on that system because we

336
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,560
weren't able to dump LSS on this system

337
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,779
but for that for whatever reason this

338
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:17,220
one worked and we kind of just wave our

339
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,440
hands and say good luck to the blue team

340
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,480
we were able to pone and own all the

341
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,160
stuff we got all the credits we got

342
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,680
domain admin so that's the key

343
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,839
difference differentiation between the

344
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,120
staff and style testing we want to have

345
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,880
that collaboration more so and really

346
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,260
focus on the control environment to

347
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,700
validate that hey why did that not

348
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,480
happen

349
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,399
um we thought that we have this EDR tool

350
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,959
we have this really flashing expensive

351
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:41,820
tool we have a set of assumptions and

352
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,079
we're going to test them before a

353
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:45,000
malicious actor can

354
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,160
that screenshot at least that I have

355
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,880
there is from a audit exercise it's

356
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,560
referred to as model validation you

357
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,760
don't really need to know the specifics

358
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,380
about it but I just thought it was

359
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,120
interesting because this is from an

360
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,220
excerpt from the FDIC if people are in

361
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,079
financial institutions or banking you

362
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:03,300
probably are scared of dicey or have

363
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,339
heard of model validation at least and

364
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:07,079
that's really at least what I view an

365
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:09,180
atomic test or these unit tests that

366
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,920
we'll be carrying out against the

367
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,060
controller environment we're really

368
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,980
measuring a system input so we perform

369
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,320
an action and what is that outcome is it

370
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,360
expected is there retuning of the

371
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,279
control that we need to perform and what

372
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:21,779
is that variance that we have of the

373
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:26,300
confidence for our general controls

374
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,380
so let's just do a brief primer of

375
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,279
attack

376
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,899
um I motivated at least what the

377
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:32,880
pyramids are of how attack was really

378
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,160
came to grow I don't have a screenshot

379
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,480
of the Enterprise framework because it

380
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,640
could be really overwhelming and I

381
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,440
invite you to explore the framework

382
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,180
yourself so if you search a minor Attack

383
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,459
start exploring it and the main takeaway

384
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:46,380
at least for how I want you to view the

385
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,519
framework is really just a

386
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,680
classification scheme attack is now

387
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,700
probably one of the most common

388
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,800
buzzwords in our industry if you look at

389
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,200
any defensive control or tool out there

390
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,940
they most likely already mapped tomato

391
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,940
attack and they have these technique IDs

392
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,279
where I mentioned dumping credentials

393
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,620
that's already a t1003 and they'll put

394
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,899
that as alert for you to map back to a

395
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:08,160
minor attack

396
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,839
um I'll get to another unfortunate

397
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,579
reality of not only that it's in our

398
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:12,839
industry which is great for

399
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:14,040
classification and having a Common

400
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,320
Language but vendors and marketing can

401
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,300
take that and run with it where they can

402
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,160
start saying some those claims where

403
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,899
they start saying things like we're 100

404
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:24,420
mapped to minor attack and that's one

405
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,920
massive trap that I'll get into because

406
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,440
you never want to view minor attack as a

407
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,940
road map of the checklist right we're

408
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,800
not producing a checklist for anyone to

409
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,779
just run through we're using as a

410
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:35,100
classification scheme to talk about

411
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,839
actions that an adversary will take in

412
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:39,079
the network

413
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,740
um last section here I just want to

414
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,019
focus in is also procedures

415
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:44,579
um where minor attack really comes from

416
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:45,959
is that classification scheme of

417
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:47,700
understanding actions

418
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,680
um The Uber breach is somewhat still

419
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,480
fresh in mind but if we take that as an

420
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,279
example of what has occurred I only

421
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,560
bring it up just because of how rich the

422
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,899
data out there is that's an example of

423
00:13:57,899 --> 00:13:59,579
where we can take an understanding of

424
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:01,260
how that attack was actually carried out

425
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:04,380
and how that breach was executed and we

426
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,760
could start making an emulation plan

427
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,740
from that right so what happened there

428
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,800
was a phishing uh coordinated so the

429
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,660
actor was able to fish an end user they

430
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,940
collected credentials and they fatigue

431
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,279
bombed the end user with MFA requests if

432
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,600
you haven't heard about that breach or

433
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,279
maybe it's still on the news that's

434
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:21,600
essentially the sum up of what happened

435
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,240
and we can classify those actions back

436
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,399
to miter attack so it's a common

437
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,079
language that attackers can quickly know

438
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,160
and understand what we're really

439
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,560
referring to otherwise we can refer get

440
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,019
into the situation where Defenders if I

441
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:36,899
say this is a cve or this is an exploit

442
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:39,000
we don't really have a really great way

443
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,680
of talking about actions that I

444
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,120
adversary can do and that's where minor

445
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,260
attack came in to make that

446
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,279
classification scheme for us

447
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,300
so let's talk about a little bit what

448
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,220
the tack traps are I mentioned it's not

449
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,480
a checklist right we're not playing

450
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,980
bingo with a minor attack framework

451
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,959
we're not looking to say I want to be

452
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,060
100 confident in every single technique

453
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,800
and sub technique that framework is

454
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,300
constantly growing it's being expanded

455
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,940
upon and minor attack looks at observed

456
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,579
attacker data it's important to know

457
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:08,699
because there are some actions that are

458
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,920
maybe still novel or nuanced so if

459
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,079
people have heard of for example like as

460
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,699
a red team or often a security team

461
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:16,980
maybe you perform a class of phishing

462
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,019
like device code fishing or perform some

463
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:21,120
novel technique that just hasn't been

464
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,699
known publicly just yet that's not going

465
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:25,139
to be in the minor attack framework so

466
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:27,120
you can probably classify it as such but

467
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,199
at least what's in the minor attack

468
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:31,079
framework is observe data

469
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:33,300
um emulating actual adversaries is also

470
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,279
pretty difficult right so we even know

471
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,899
that we have the framework we still have

472
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:38,459
to make test cases that we can easily

473
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:39,480
take

474
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,740
um into the internal Network in our

475
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,600
organizations and carry out those types

476
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,980
of exercises

477
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,360
and then finally

478
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,579
um Kris or kpis those kind of key

479
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,560
indicators that we report to Executives

480
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,699
or at least the business to actually

481
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,160
understand what we're doing that can be

482
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,260
misleading right so if we try to take

483
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,600
attack and we want to make an emulation

484
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,060
plan meaning I see these types of

485
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,380
techniques that I want to test my

486
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,720
control environment to

487
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,339
um we can't just bring out and say we're

488
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,959
100 confident like I was saying you

489
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,279
can't just be there's gonna be some

490
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:09,720
degree of variance and you want to be at

491
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,399
least realistic with your expectations

492
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:14,399
and how you actually produce reports um

493
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,260
to Executive teams or other leaderships

494
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,459
that don't have the Nuance or

495
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:18,480
understanding of what we're actually

496
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,500
doing

497
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,240
um one of the biggest problems is that

498
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,639
minor attack is now a buzzword but I

499
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:24,959
often see that at least smaller

500
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,240
organizations or maybe really the top

501
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,740
five percent even know how to actually

502
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,600
use minor attack in a meaningful way or

503
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,639
make it actionable we oftentimes see

504
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,160
that miter attack is just this buzzword

505
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,019
and security teams don't even know what

506
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:38,820
you could really use it how can you

507
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,500
actually use it internally there's a

508
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,959
huge gap between the skill sets that the

509
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,220
the trickle-down effect in cyber

510
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:47,339
security where members and top leading

511
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,100
teams high-end resources they can do

512
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,600
these types of tests but then the small

513
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,220
businesses and mid-sized organizations

514
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,320
they're kind of left um empty-handed

515
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,759
they don't have the capabilities to run

516
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:58,259
these types of emulations

517
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:00,240
um so that's one one hope that I hope

518
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,160
um I can try to touch on in just a

519
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,398
little bit

520
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,599
um one image down there if you can't see

521
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,699
it that's a Twitter search I didn't show

522
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:10,079
the results because

523
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:10,679
um

524
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:12,359
it still horrifies me a little bit but

525
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:14,160
if you search 100 minor attack coverage

526
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,280
that was the uh idea that I had in terms

527
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,319
of trying to propose what happens with

528
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,000
marketing and vendors they're running

529
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,919
with the attack framework and just

530
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:24,599
proposing that their solution is the

531
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:27,119
best we have map 100 matter attack if

532
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,260
you ever hear that or if people are

533
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,720
trying to claim that start running away

534
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,980
and look for someone else

535
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,120
um so I already mentioned the industry

536
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,160
issues a little bit but for example the

537
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,500
security tools all of them now map back

538
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,660
to minor attack and if a smaller

539
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,980
mid-sized organization so let me know

540
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,720
how to use it that's a huge gap and at

541
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,640
least training or at least educating how

542
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,039
to use that framework and then the one

543
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:52,260
uh on the bottom here the multi-factor

544
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,299
authentication request generation that's

545
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:56,520
the one that was abused in not only in

546
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,200
Uber but other

547
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,360
um other organizations at least when a

548
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,880
breach occurred meaning that red team is

549
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,220
an offensive security teams we knew that

550
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,160
uh if you start bombing end users with

551
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,380
um MFA token so if we capture

552
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,240
credentials if we fish that or guess the

553
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,880
password and then we see an MFA prompt

554
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,740
that there's a soft token associated

555
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,780
with that on their phone like OCTA for

556
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,580
example or Microsoft authenticator where

557
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,799
you say yes that was me that logged in

558
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,720
we've known that's been an attack Vector

559
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,340
for quite some time it's worked in pen

560
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,559
test and other red team types of

561
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,960
exercises but that wasn't a minor attack

562
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,360
only until this past year

563
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,799
um so it's important to understand that

564
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,020
although we can leverage this framework

565
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,160
to start enhancing our control

566
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,299
environment that doesn't mean it's going

567
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:40,860
to be the end and you can't just rely on

568
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,660
a miter attack To Be Your solution or

569
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,799
silver bullet in cyber security

570
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,000
so where does minor attack even come

571
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,740
from uh The observed data is really

572
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,640
important

573
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,200
um so it's it's everything that's in

574
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,940
cyber threat intelligence reporting the

575
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,039
public reporting that we have the Uber

576
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:58,440
breach I keep I don't want to blame Uber

577
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,520
or anything but they're a really good

578
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,559
example of that's pretty rich data that

579
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:03,660
we have from an attacker essentially

580
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,660
posting or researchers posting what the

581
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,760
attacker was doing on Twitter so we

582
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,020
could look at Twitter and making an

583
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,760
emulation plan we can map that back to

584
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,220
minor attack another really good one is

585
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,200
the Cisco breach that occurred a couple

586
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,080
months ago but they really took um I

587
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,700
thought really a great approach the

588
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,799
tower security blog once the actor

589
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,720
essentially claimed that Cisco was

590
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,179
breached Cisco Talus they lit labeled

591
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:30,419
and went through the exact steps um that

592
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,520
the attacker took in the network

593
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,900
notifying not only the techniques and

594
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,880
what was executed they went even further

595
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,500
of showing the exact command line that

596
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,900
was ran and we need more of that because

597
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,120
uh public cyber intelligence is

598
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,400
sometimes lacking and minor attack is

599
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,320
there and since it's such a buzzword

600
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,660
oftentimes the reports that we do get is

601
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,160
just here's the techniques they ran they

602
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,500
did t1003 credential dumping they did

603
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,320
phishing but as a person who's trying to

604
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,700
emulate the adversary so if we're trying

605
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,679
to bring that in the internal Network I

606
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:00,120
have no idea of how I'm actually going

607
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,679
to make a plan or a test case what

608
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,660
commands do I need to run do they do

609
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,660
spear phishing did they do fishing with

610
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,179
a link in it is there a download that

611
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:11,039
they did um or what what sort of

612
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,900
commands did they actually run so in

613
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,280
terms of the grand scheme of the layout

614
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,600
of how we can actually use miter attack

615
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,000
it's a procedure data in actions that we

616
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,620
need to use to actually emulate

617
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,940
adversaries and that all comes from

618
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,620
public reporting there's obviously

619
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,360
private cyber intelligence so you could

620
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,559
probably leverage that if you do have

621
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:27,299
subscription fees to that or aware of it

622
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:29,340
but the public space is where at least

623
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,600
small businesses and mid-sized

624
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,340
organizations are going to be able to

625
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,620
take direct action to build those test

626
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,979
cases

627
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,640
so this is a brief example of How It's

628
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,320
Made again this is public so if you

629
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,120
wanted to go in the miter attack website

630
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,340
this is an example of cyber threat

631
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,500
intelligence reporting so those reports

632
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,260
that come out from breaches the diber

633
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,120
report is really great a great resource

634
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,400
resource in terms of them analyzing

635
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,020
breach data and trying to map that back

636
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,100
to attack

637
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,020
everything that's publicly available to

638
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,580
us we can start classifying those

639
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,620
actions and map back to miter attack

640
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,360
once we have a common theme of

641
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,919
understanding of what techniques and

642
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:07,260
actors performing we can either compound

643
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,640
those techniques together to make an

644
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,780
emulation plan

645
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,280
so in this case if I wanted to make an

646
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,679
emulation plane from this I'm bringing

647
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,720
an audit exercise I could do spear

648
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,880
phishing link I could do Spearfish

649
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,440
fishing attachment so having an

650
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,600
attachment associated with an email and

651
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,500
there's going to be some sort of

652
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,299
execution

653
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:26,640
um it that could be confusing because

654
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,440
again when I mentioning the techniques

655
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,720
here there's not enough procedure data

656
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,520
Maybe for me to make actions on it I may

657
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,080
have to make guesses to make sure that

658
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,100
I'm actually emulating that set

659
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,780
adversary and that could be okay but

660
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,820
that's where again that procedure data

661
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,260
is really important for us to be able to

662
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,419
actually emulate an adverse Theory and

663
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:44,640
see what the actual results would be

664
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,659
um against the threat

665
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,460
um so there's a ton of techniques and

666
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,539
sub techniques that might our attack

667
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:53,460
that Enterprise framework a good

668
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,960
question from an auditing principle

669
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,059
would be what is important to prioritize

670
00:21:57,059 --> 00:21:58,799
because I mentioned a lot of credential

671
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,419
dumping that's a very common attack

672
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:02,280
technique and probably the highest alert

673
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,620
that you'd get from the EDR Sim so

674
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,600
that's t103 that could be a good place

675
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,419
to start miter Ingenuity uh the center

676
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:12,120
for a threat and form defense they have

677
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,000
released this calculator we can call it

678
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,580
that essentially starts mapping out

679
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,980
different procedures or techniques that

680
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,320
are going to be the ones that are either

681
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,600
have the most procedures of ways to

682
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,940
emulate that action the ones that are

683
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,100
have interdependencies so if we think

684
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,960
about executing Powershell or malicious

685
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,700
Powershell or doing process injection

686
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,559
for example there's going to be several

687
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,900
techniques tied to an active performing

688
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,299
process injection so they try to have

689
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:41,280
this calculator where not only do they

690
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,440
map the technique and give you like a

691
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,059
scoring to prioritize with your

692
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:47,100
emulation plan they also map back to

693
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,380
specific Frameworks so tying this back

694
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:52,020
to the business if my business is doing

695
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,059
the CIS controls and I have an

696
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:55,919
assumption that there's a gap between

697
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,860
CIS control let's call number four or

698
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,140
five whatever

699
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:04,140
like let's say there's a assumption that

700
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,000
there's a gap there I can bring that to

701
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,260
the business and make an emulation plan

702
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,059
that's going to hit and showcase that

703
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:12,120
Gap potentially inside and try to bring

704
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,919
in more resources and internally to try

705
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,360
and solve that uh hidden hidden Gap

706
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,780
essentially

707
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,640
um so Conti is another really good

708
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,799
example of an emulation plane that we

709
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,860
can quickly make the one additional trap

710
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,659
that I'm going to mention here is if we

711
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:29,940
wanted to emulate Conti we can do that

712
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,700
but this is Conti from 2021 right so if

713
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,400
we wanted to make an emulation plan

714
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,100
uh focusing on Conti so we have that

715
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,419
translated Playbook they're the

716
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:41,220
ransomware as a service affiliate group

717
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,679
that was publishing this documentation

718
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:44,760
internally

719
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,340
they were using Cobalt strike to execute

720
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,960
ransomware and internal networks so

721
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,159
someone would achieve initial access

722
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,559
they would come in with Cobalt strike a

723
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,360
beacon is kind of running and they would

724
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,039
do these specific actions this is their

725
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:58,559
playbook internally that they're using

726
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,000
uh internally they had this Playbook so

727
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,380
the ransomware as a service group had

728
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,419
several different actors performing

729
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:08,220
these actions and this play looks really

730
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,600
powerful because we get this sense of

731
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,700
What actors are actually doing some of

732
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,740
it's very trivial examples of shell who

733
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:16,080
am I so running a basic command like

734
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,539
that or enumerating domain controllers

735
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:21,120
very basic commands to discover hosts

736
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,280
and while that may sound trivial in

737
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,659
itself that's very powerful for us to

738
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:25,679
understand What actors are actually

739
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,120
doing what behaviors are they going to

740
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,380
be doing in the network

741
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,760
but that doesn't necessarily mean that's

742
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,559
going to prepare you for Conti of next

743
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:33,059
year right so they're now going to

744
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:35,520
enhance their capabilities as well but

745
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,320
as at least in the emulation plane if

746
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,700
you have that understanding we can have

747
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,140
a different objective for how we're

748
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:43,280
going to test our control environment

749
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,440
and make sure you want to use existing

750
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,240
resources so there's no reason why we

751
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,280
should shy away from leveraging public

752
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,159
and open source uh resources that way we

753
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:54,419
can make the best stimulation plan

754
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:56,400
possible so Scythe has a really great

755
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,020
purple team exercise framework that's on

756
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,179
version two now and public document

757
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:01,500
where you can start getting an

758
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,419
understanding of how you can become an

759
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:04,860
operator quote-unquote how you can

760
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,720
actually carry these test cases and not

761
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,799
only that but how you should be

762
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:10,260
reporting on it reporting is very

763
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,880
difficult still it's still somewhat new

764
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,260
people are trying different things of

765
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,720
how you can maybe show different heat

766
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,240
maps of here's the actual actions that

767
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,340
be performed it's still somewhat in the

768
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,659
process of being developed I think

769
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:23,460
personally and it's not really solved

770
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,559
just yet but there's different ways we

771
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:27,960
can start approaching it to approach

772
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,240
teams internally so if you have an audit

773
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,919
team internally this is a good way to

774
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,679
say hey we've never done a system input

775
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:36,480
or model validation against our Sim or

776
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,880
EDR why don't we start doing that and I

777
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,039
guarantee you that in a year or so the

778
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,179
audit team is probably trying to figure

779
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:43,860
out what they want to audit anyways and

780
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,600
if you're bringing in an idea to them

781
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,880
that they have never audited before it's

782
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,799
a high-risk system an EDR Sim we could

783
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,419
probably classify it as such they

784
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:52,679
probably want to incorporate that with

785
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:54,419
an audit test based plan and we can kind

786
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:56,880
of work in conjunction with not only as

787
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,380
offensive security or security teams

788
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,520
that are still building out their

789
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,799
capabilities they can work with existing

790
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:04,260
resources Interline so audit teams if

791
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,940
you have a third-party auditor you can

792
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,919
start motivating let's start doing

793
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,059
something that's going to be actually

794
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:11,580
High return rather than a college

795
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,919
graduate student that just is getting a

796
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:14,940
checklist going through a list

797
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,400
unfortunately for Auditors if you've

798
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,740
been audited and have randomized into

799
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:22,380
something I I feel your pain but over

800
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,760
time that's kind of the goal behind this

801
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,200
we want to make sure people have the

802
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,120
resources and education to know how to

803
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,799
carry out these exercises and we're not

804
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,539
just hiding that away from like the top

805
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:33,679
five percent of the industry

806
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,100
so

807
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,380
um I mentioned the red teams like to be

808
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,940
really sophisticated we want to show off

809
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,100
uh but sometimes you just have to start

810
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,080
simple and motivate at least an

811
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,880
understanding of let's do very simple

812
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,460
actions before we get really complicated

813
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,980
and do like a full team purple purple

814
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,200
team exercise let's just start simple of

815
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,840
doing specific actions make a more

816
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,340
specific test case and emulation plan

817
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,020
and then slowly we'll get into more

818
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,299
Advanced Techniques but depending on

819
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:01,919
what are we actually seeing in that in

820
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,179
the wild and what's actually important

821
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:04,860
to us internally

822
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,179
um I just thought this was a funny image

823
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:08,700
because uh that's Steve borash is pretty

824
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,460
there and that tweet is just it speaks

825
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,299
to

826
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:13,860
um a lot of what's going on in Industry

827
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,380
because our offensive teams are usually

828
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,260
very sophisticated and can execute very

829
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,900
complicated attack chains we have a lot

830
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,760
of uh capabilities and we can execute

831
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,340
these techniques however a nation state

832
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,559
quote unquote that it was executing

833
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,260
ransomware put memicats on a domain

834
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,820
controller and that was as simple as

835
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:36,000
them ransomware in an organization so if

836
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,740
we put mimikats then we become a nation

837
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,480
state or an adversary so that's just

838
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,520
something to think about where there's

839
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,279
this feeling of of levels of our red

840
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:46,200
teams are sometimes even better than the

841
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,580
18 year old that is hacking

842
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,919
organizations and if that's the case

843
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,380
maybe we need to re take a glance at

844
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,580
what's actually important to us and how

845
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,320
we're assessing controls and take our

846
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,340
time with actually making these

847
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,919
emulation plans to get the most return

848
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:02,480
um in our defenses

849
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:06,360
so how do we actually do this so I kind

850
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,400
of talked a lot about Theory and how we

851
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,080
can use audit principles and incorporate

852
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,240
that in our test cases

853
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,860
um to start simply the very first place

854
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,299
you should start so if you've never done

855
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:16,980
a purple team or you've heard of that

856
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,659
this is the first time you're hearing

857
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:19,740
anything about purple teaming or

858
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,779
anything like that the first place you

859
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:22,799
should start is something called

860
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,500
autonomic testing or unit testing that's

861
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,620
basic QA for your EDR your sim or

862
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,419
something you're trying to measure what

863
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:31,980
I mean by that is you're going to make

864
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,419
that emulation plan so you're going to

865
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:35,159
identify the techniques or active that's

866
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:37,260
relevant you can even just take the top

867
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,779
ten so Red Canary has their annual

868
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:41,700
report that they produce of the top 10

869
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,440
techniques that malicious actors do we

870
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,360
don't maybe need to even specify a group

871
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,100
we can just say these are the techniques

872
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,539
that we care about the most of assessing

873
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:50,460
we're going to assume that our controls

874
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,539
are going to do very well against them

875
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:53,279
and really test them and see and just

876
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,140
demonstrate to the business that hey we

877
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,760
did this test we know that this control

878
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,860
is actually working so that way our

879
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,179
resources are going into the right

880
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:01,380
Investments and we're making the right

881
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,460
decisions

882
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,700
so Atomic Testing is very simple but the

883
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,980
accuracy and realism is lost in that

884
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,140
sense so you have to realize that too so

885
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,760
although we could do these unit tests of

886
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,559
running single actions

887
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:15,059
um so an atomic test could be as simple

888
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:16,620
as just running who am I in Powershell

889
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:19,320
or it could be putting memicats on a

890
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,399
domain controller and seeing what the

891
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:21,419
outcomes are

892
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:24,000
that's not really fully uh fleshing out

893
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,860
an attack chain or theorizing what

894
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,600
actions an attacker could do so that's

895
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,860
where the emulation part gets very

896
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,960
difficult so although Atomic Testing is

897
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,520
really great to get to Telemetry and

898
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,419
understanding of what's actually

899
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:34,440
occurring in the background with their

900
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,419
systems over time you're going to want

901
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:39,120
to advance a little bit further

902
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,559
um so if you don't have the capabilities

903
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,260
to run an atomic test yourself there's

904
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,059
already open source resources I

905
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:47,100
mentioned Red Canary they also maintain

906
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,440
the atomic red team which is a library

907
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,779
of automated ways to run these types of

908
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:54,059
test cases and that's an immediate place

909
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:55,740
you could start where if you've never

910
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,419
even needed assess your EDR or didn't

911
00:29:57,419 --> 00:29:58,919
know that you should be

912
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:00,899
definitely start there I'm just seeing

913
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:02,460
what the outcomes are I guarantee that

914
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,899
EDR is probably only going to pick up on

915
00:30:03,899 --> 00:30:06,720
the highest level of alerts and while it

916
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,880
would log the lower level tier that's

917
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,140
where you need to start tuning in and

918
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,659
assessing it throughout your environment

919
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:14,340
um what I have in in the image by the

920
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,799
way is a screenshot to uh the Splunk

921
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,620
attack range they're now on version two

922
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,659
so that's an easy way to at least get

923
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:22,620
started

924
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,820
um so you want to make sure you're doing

925
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,020
this in a controlled manner because

926
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,640
these are offensive actions right we're

927
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,760
performing emulations and actions as an

928
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,799
adversary so a good place to get started

929
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:34,200
is something like a lab environment and

930
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,700
that's a smug attack range where you can

931
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,679
quickly set up infrastructure all in the

932
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,000
cloud separated from your production

933
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,620
environment see what you're actually

934
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,659
going to be running and how things

935
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:44,580
should appear on defensive controls they

936
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,740
have Splunk already started there if you

937
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,820
don't have Splunk you can at least get a

938
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,399
sense of the data that should exist on

939
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,140
your end controls

940
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,640
another tool that I'm going to mention

941
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,100
quickly too is Prelude operator the

942
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,260
Prelude team is one important resource

943
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:01,080
that is extending where I think a time a

944
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,360
great team isn't a great place to

945
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,620
perform the Atomic Testing of those

946
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,020
basic unit tests but Prelude operator is

947
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,940
one Evolution that you can think of it

948
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,220
as to start maturizing that process so

949
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,140
Atomic Testing really good to get end

950
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,360
results of did I get the expected result

951
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,640
of an output that I'm looking for

952
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,500
payload operator starts building out

953
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,500
attacker methodology and chains where it

954
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,539
has a remote access Beacon you can think

955
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:26,700
of it as so we have a tangible process

956
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,500
that's running and carrying out these

957
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,299
different actions so not only are you

958
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:31,559
running who am I you could start

959
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:33,360
building out different techniques on top

960
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,039
of each other if you're going to run who

961
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,419
am I you're going to enumerate domain

962
00:31:36,419 --> 00:31:39,000
controllers you're going to find users

963
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,100
who logged in and discover all Network

964
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,020
shares almost taking the Playbook of

965
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,779
conti and doing that all in an action of

966
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,520
under a separate process that's running

967
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,559
so it gives the EDR a little bit more of

968
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:51,419
a fair fight to start investigating and

969
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:53,760
triaging those uh different events into

970
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,440
one generic incident or alert

971
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,980
this image is from the micro emulation

972
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,840
Blog the miter engineer produced again

973
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,460
that's that was just published two days

974
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,559
ago so this is still somewhat new in the

975
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:09,240
industry of trying to figure out a

976
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,679
common ground of how teams can actually

977
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:13,260
carry out these exercises I really love

978
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,120
this image because it showcases the

979
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,580
evolutions that you can make in terms of

980
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,380
how you can actually produce emulation

981
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,059
plans so if you don't have the teams or

982
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:23,340
resources to carry out a purple team

983
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,020
well you could start basic and simple

984
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,940
just running an atomic test right so you

985
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,620
can go to management you can go to

986
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,899
Executives and say we haven't tested our

987
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:33,000
EDR how can we incorporate things that

988
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,679
already exist so if it's an audit team

989
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:36,059
that's in the background maybe that's

990
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:37,440
something they should be reviewing or at

991
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,960
least assisting you with or two if

992
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,000
you're a defender on the blue team and

993
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,260
you just don't have the resources

994
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,179
capabilities that's some some place you

995
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:46,980
can just start simple and demonstrate

996
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,080
value in Return of let's use a common

997
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,580
language that we have maybe you're in

998
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,679
the weeds of understanding how the EDR

999
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:55,200
Works how these defensive controls all

1000
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,279
work in your environment and you're

1001
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:58,200
wearing multiple hats of I.T and a

1002
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,720
security combined but then you can start

1003
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,159
using their language right we could use

1004
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,600
the Frameworks that businesses actually

1005
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,940
understand like the CIS controls the top

1006
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:08,580
18 in the CSF and if we start mapping

1007
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:11,159
that back back to each other we can have

1008
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:13,380
that common language and start getting

1009
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,299
more Investments to actual resources

1010
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:16,860
that we actually need

1011
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,779
micro emulations are a little bit more

1012
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:20,399
interesting that's kind of using that

1013
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,200
chain methodology where we're trying to

1014
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,720
execute various actions automatically

1015
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,940
for us so rather than isolating a

1016
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,860
specific unit test of just running who

1017
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:31,260
am I it starts emulating a plan a little

1018
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,419
bit more defined of an actual objective

1019
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:34,860
that an attacker may want to perform

1020
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:37,500
it's a discovery or lateral movement

1021
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,240
that could be its own micro ammulation

1022
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,100
that we can think of of just putting on

1023
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,200
a lot of procedures and just testing out

1024
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,539
the entire environment and finally a

1025
00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:48,720
real full fledged out purple team where

1026
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,820
unfortunately it's still at the you know

1027
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,080
five to ten percent of the cyber

1028
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,460
security space that actually performs

1029
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,440
purple teams at least the way you would

1030
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,240
think of the same this is so much rule

1031
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,279
with red teams but as we start building

1032
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,419
out and trickle to have that

1033
00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:01,860
trickle-down effect and more

1034
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,360
organizations starting to do these types

1035
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,980
of tests I think we're going to be at

1036
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,059
least better off

1037
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:08,040
um than having a malicious Vector do

1038
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,619
those tests for us

1039
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:11,599
okay

1040
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,219
I just wanted to I have these videos and

1041
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,418
these slides will also be readily

1042
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:16,320
available

1043
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,580
um so if this video doesn't come out

1044
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,320
that greatest I just wanted to Showcase

1045
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,520
some videos of what it actually looks

1046
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,418
like

1047
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:22,500
um a lot of the time this is still

1048
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,179
somewhat new to people and they haven't

1049
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:26,580
seen tangible Guides of what it actually

1050
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,980
looks like when you do a test case

1051
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,899
um I promise it's as simple as I'm

1052
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:32,699
trying to make it sound where you just

1053
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:34,918
run a Powershell script and you're just

1054
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:36,418
emulating an adversary and that's the

1055
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:37,500
whole idea behind it we want to make

1056
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,859
this easily cheap and effective for

1057
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:42,899
organizations to bring into their

1058
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:44,580
environments tomorrow

1059
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:47,639
so one example that I'll run

1060
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,859
and I'll try to talk over it as we

1061
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:51,899
approach time

1062
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:54,480
is on the top here I'm looking at the

1063
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,300
Red Canary GitHub that's their atomic

1064
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,280
red team Suite library and I'm just

1065
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,780
highlighting the technique that maybe

1066
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,420
I'm interested in executing or carrying

1067
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,220
as an atomic test case

1068
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,320
and this one the technique is referred

1069
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,820
to it as credential dumping but

1070
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:11,280
specifically I'm looking at ntds dumping

1071
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,260
here's all the relevant Atomic test

1072
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,420
cases they show you the command of how

1073
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:18,599
to run a action so if I don't know how

1074
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:20,700
to do an NTS dump here's the exact

1075
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,320
action that I can perform

1076
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,940
I'm going to pause really quickly just

1077
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,920
to explain what's going on I've set up

1078
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,839
an attack range using Splunk attack

1079
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,839
range V2 that's simply just running a

1080
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:33,480
terraform script it deploys to AWS if

1081
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,099
you just provided the necessary access

1082
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:36,900
and it builds this lab environment with

1083
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,700
all these nice tools it comes with the

1084
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,800
Sonic red team and I can quickly start

1085
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,599
test casing out

1086
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:43,859
um different actions that I want to see

1087
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:46,560
what the results are so at the top left

1088
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,180
hand corner if you see where the shell

1089
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,520
actually starts I'm running attack range

1090
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,339
here and I'm simulating using Atomic red

1091
00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:55,920
team and the specific sub technique that

1092
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,320
I'm running is t103 so that's the NTS

1093
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,300
them that's from the minor the Red

1094
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,800
Canary Atomic Library

1095
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,320
and then finally I am specifying my

1096
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,640
target which in this case it's already

1097
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,859
created for me and on the bottom it

1098
00:36:07,859 --> 00:36:10,740
starts running that test case for me

1099
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,240
so it's going to play it's going to

1100
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,099
gather all the evidence of making sure

1101
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:15,300
that the test case was actually

1102
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,800
validated and successful again making

1103
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,980
those repeatable uh test cases so that

1104
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,020
way when I run a test case I can go back

1105
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,820
and anyone could observe what actually

1106
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,500
happened and it validated that it ran

1107
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,480
successfully and then see tangible

1108
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,099
evidence that it ran we collected

1109
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:30,720
credentials either successfully we can

1110
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,640
assess what the output is for my control

1111
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,619
environment

1112
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:36,839
yeah

1113
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:40,140
I'll just skip ahead a little bit

1114
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,420
um so after that test case is done it's

1115
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,520
maybe a little bit blurry let's see if

1116
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,960
it comes up

1117
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,920
let's go back

1118
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,540
I just want to show you what

1119
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:55,020
Splunk has in their attack range

1120
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,300
I'm going to pause here

1121
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,420
you can see uh what actually happened uh

1122
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,800
in terms of Atomic Testing that we

1123
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,240
performed so the Splunk range is already

1124
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,920
nice where it has this kind of Sword

1125
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,720
dashboard that you can start visualizing

1126
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,280
the simulations you're running obviously

1127
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,420
your tools may be a little bit different

1128
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,940
but just to motivate how easy it is to

1129
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,500
start performing these actions and how

1130
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,000
you can start assessing what the results

1131
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,099
are here's the atomic test that we ran

1132
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:19,200
we can see the exact command line data

1133
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,460
that we ran if it actually ran

1134
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:22,020
successfully or maybe we didn't get the

1135
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,700
Telemetry we didn't see what the our

1136
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,079
defensive controls for some reason

1137
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:27,599
didn't capture this evidence and that's

1138
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,220
an example of a touch case just running

1139
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,260
very simply and over time you could

1140
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,000
start maturizing that or enhancing that

1141
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,560
to be a little bit more complicated

1142
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,660
that's one test case with Atomic Testing

1143
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,460
unit testing but then we can get more

1144
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,320
complicated where we start using maybe a

1145
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,300
C2 maybe we want to run a beacon with

1146
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,700
Cobalt strike or with a purple team

1147
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,920
framework like something with dice or

1148
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,880
something just to get a little bit more

1149
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,900
complicated and see what the actual

1150
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,380
results are

1151
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,820
so I know we're coming up in time and I

1152
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,200
have a couple more videos here which

1153
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,060
you're happy to look at uh through my

1154
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,460
slides um I go into how to use Prelude

1155
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,560
operator I also have slides about using

1156
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,780
Vector which is a free solution

1157
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,099
um like Community ran by the security

1158
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:07,200
risk advisors but they try to solve the

1159
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,359
problem with actually producing a report

1160
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:12,240
in a meaningful way for executives and

1161
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,980
other people to understand because I'm

1162
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,359
going really in the weeds of how to

1163
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,099
perform these test cases the most

1164
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:18,540
important part is able to explain what

1165
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,040
we're actually doing how do we actually

1166
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,560
explain what does an NTS dump really

1167
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,540
mean is an executive going to

1168
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,099
necessarily need to know the details of

1169
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:28,140
how I ran that action not necessarily

1170
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,060
but if they understand that hey we're

1171
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,400
good against this credential access or

1172
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,900
someone trying to obtain credentials

1173
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,940
we've been able to test that in several

1174
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,020
different

1175
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,000
examples and here's our confidence of

1176
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,980
how well we think we can do against an

1177
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:44,180
actor that may be doing that

1178
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,680
um I know we're essentially right on

1179
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:49,140
time so I want to pause and just make

1180
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,579
sure if there's any questions or

1181
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:51,900
comments

1182
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,320
good

1183
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,320
yeah

1184
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,900
especially when you get

1185
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,520
lightning over

1186
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,140
yeah that's a good question so the

1187
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,880
answer is yes I didn't really go too

1188
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,280
much into threat modeling but if you

1189
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,740
have if you want to make a business case

1190
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,380
to Executives or memberships of their

1191
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:27,060
hearing on the news for example they

1192
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,520
just heard on the news Uber so in their

1193
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,500
next strategic meetings they're going to

1194
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,940
be talking about Uber and that breach

1195
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,859
and then if you already came prepared to

1196
00:39:34,859 --> 00:39:36,599
that meeting as a security professional

1197
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:38,640
or someone who wants to be able to

1198
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,960
Showcase how we can defend against it

1199
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,000
you can come prepared and say well this

1200
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,520
is the threat profile it's seemingly a

1201
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,260
teenager I'm not sure this position who

1202
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,460
carried that the attack I don't know if

1203
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,260
it's published but it seemingly a

1204
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,300
teenager is this relevant to our

1205
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,460
industry most likely yes or maybe

1206
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,079
ransomware is another threat profile

1207
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:56,520
that we want to care about you can start

1208
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,200
listing out here's public cyber threat

1209
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,720
intelligence and I want to create a test

1210
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,040
case I want to I want to see how our

1211
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,720
controls actually do we've never done a

1212
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,339
test case and that'll give you more

1213
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:07,320
return on investment in my opinion of

1214
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,240
coming prepared with talking about

1215
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,599
Samantha either industry known so boards

1216
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:13,619
and executives are unfortunately going

1217
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:15,180
to start talking about Uber

1218
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,320
um but if you come prepared with the

1219
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,000
answer of saying well I know the actions

1220
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,800
here so we can classify them they don't

1221
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,440
need to know the t1o metrics but we can

1222
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,579
start talking about that in a Common

1223
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:25,200
Language and say well if you want to

1224
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,880
test it we can run these to kind of

1225
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,040
audit uh internally and see what the

1226
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,140
outcomes are

1227
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,319
good

1228
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,480
yeah so that was um that's a minor

1229
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,760
Ingenuity uh if you look up miter attack

1230
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,460
calculator for minor Ingenuity that

1231
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,619
should come up uh that's the they they

1232
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:48,180
minor engineering does a lot of

1233
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,320
different things they also do the

1234
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,460
attacking valves which I didn't really

1235
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:52,800
get into but I highly recommend looking

1236
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,780
at the attack evals that's going to give

1237
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,520
you a good perspective of how to run

1238
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,560
these emulation planes because they're

1239
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,000
the ones actually carrying out these

1240
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,380
exercises

1241
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,700
um one thing that I'm just going to

1242
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,960
shoot out just because I think it's

1243
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,700
really important to know they somehow

1244
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,920
managed to get every EDR vendor and the

1245
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,220
next evaluation is ndr but somehow they

1246
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,020
were able to convince a lot of EDR

1247
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,760
vendors or the big name players to come

1248
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,160
into an emulation plan exercise and they

1249
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,079
just test edrs they're kind of doing

1250
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:20,339
these emulation plans that I was

1251
00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:21,960
mentioning against gdrs it's all

1252
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,579
publicly available you can see what the

1253
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:25,260
outcomes are for each ER and see how

1254
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,579
everything Compares if you haven't

1255
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:28,020
looked at the talking emails I highly

1256
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,640
recommend it it's not just a buzzword

1257
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,440
definitely it's really rich in great

1258
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,380
data that they have out there

1259
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,920
good

1260
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:40,260
yeah

1261
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,859
yep

1262
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,920
so I I I'm only talking about the free

1263
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,599
Community Resources it's just because in

1264
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:50,880
my opinion it's still lackluster in the

1265
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,680
mid to organ like mid-sized

1266
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,940
organizations like they don't have the

1267
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:56,280
resources to go out and purchase uh five

1268
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,540
thousand ten thousand dollar tool

1269
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,099
tomorrow so that's why I'm really

1270
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:00,900
talking about the free tools because

1271
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,160
they're effective and they actually work

1272
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,320
but those are really great examples I

1273
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,300
mentioned Scythe attack IQ has attack

1274
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,560
platforms like the breach attack

1275
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,660
simulation tools they can do it kind of

1276
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,400
for you in a way that if you have the

1277
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,320
resources and you want to test it out by

1278
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,060
all means go for it but these are really

1279
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,380
quick returns that you can click your

1280
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,780
brain to your environment and test

1281
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,880
um immediately

1282
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,980
my question is about recording um

1283
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,839
um so that's a problem not only in this

1284
00:42:54,839 --> 00:42:56,099
space but that's just cyber security

1285
00:42:56,099 --> 00:42:57,839
reporting in general right we're just

1286
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:00,720
flooding Executives with we stopped a

1287
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,700
hundred thousand and we have so much

1288
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,200
signals on data and this is what we did

1289
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,300
with our firewall that's a like honestly

1290
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,339
a time of junk honestly data and the

1291
00:43:08,339 --> 00:43:09,540
same is kind of almost true with how

1292
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:10,560
we're reporting on miter attack

1293
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,140
unfortunately to answer your question

1294
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:14,520
Executives like really quick one image

1295
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,839
blurbs

1296
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:16,920
um they're not going to be the technical

1297
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,420
Experts of understanding why ntds

1298
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:20,579
dumping is or anything like that but if

1299
00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:22,260
you have that confidence Matrix like I'm

1300
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:24,240
a big fan of the heat Maps so if you're

1301
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,280
maybe not even using minor attack per se

1302
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,839
but if you can develop like a heat map

1303
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:30,780
or um attack flow data like kind of

1304
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:32,160
telling a story is the best way I can

1305
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,079
think of it as what an attacker would do

1306
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,359
from not necessarily the specific

1307
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:37,920
actions but what they're trying to do in

1308
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,540
the environment and Howard this is

1309
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:41,640
either green good however we did in the

1310
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,740
exercise this is bad or like more red

1311
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:46,079
kind of signaling to them of the entire

1312
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,060
exercise it's a really hard problem I I

1313
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,099
don't have like a specific solution but

1314
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:51,900
trying to make make a story I think is

1315
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:55,220
the best way to kind of go about it

1316
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,579
okay I think we're in time so like I

1317
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:00,900
