1
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:22,920
yeah I'm Joe

2
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,800
um worked for Wolf and Company uh big

3
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,380
CPA firm but we I like to say we have

4
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,300
Den secure which is our like six seven

5
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,859
person team bolted to the side of the

6
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:33,660
CPA firm

7
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,600
um so we do pen testing

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,460
all kinds all varieties

9
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,020
um I'm not gonna belabor the point if

10
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,879
you need one come see us we'd love to

11
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:43,260
help you out

12
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,180
um and just real quick like

13
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,980
show of hands how many people in here

14
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,559
have ever had to buy a pen test

15
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:52,379
one two okay a lot of people

16
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:53,879
nice awesome

17
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:56,940
we'll talk about that experience later

18
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,940
so why we're here

19
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,000
um

20
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,920
this is still very like in my opinion

21
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,140
poorly understood exercise when it comes

22
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,479
to the clients that we have as well as

23
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:10,860
the people who are sometimes doing this

24
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,540
like I don't know if anybody else has

25
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,360
noticed but there's like this explosion

26
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,520
of uh vendors they're like hey we can

27
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,860
make money off of selling X Y or Z like

28
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,860
security like product to people and we

29
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,060
should probably just try to do that make

30
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,380
as much money as we can even though we

31
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,540
don't necessarily know what we're doing

32
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,280
um I've not been around in this industry

33
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,360
as long as some of the people in this

34
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,799
room but I from what I understand it's

35
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:32,880
been a problem since pretty much

36
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,520
security was a term uh so I don't think

37
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,780
it's getting it doesn't seem to be

38
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,000
getting any better to be honest uh and

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,200
getting it wrong has serious

40
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,320
consequences I mean if you get what you

41
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,640
think is a pen test and it's not

42
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,259
actually a pen test and then you think

43
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:49,079
you're good to go and then that per that

44
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,460
whoever those people were didn't do a

45
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,740
good job and next thing you know you get

46
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,119
reached because they missed some

47
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:55,799
glaringly obvious thing that a pen test

48
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,240
would have found then that's kind of an

49
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,340
issue

50
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,840
um another I already mentioned this but

51
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,799
the vendors selling these Services

52
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,060
aren't actually performing them

53
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,159
performing them how many people who have

54
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,320
bought a pentas and had a pen test

55
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,880
ended up with a vulnerability scan and

56
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,160
they only found out later

57
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,180
nobody all right or one okay

58
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,680
and it annoys me that's why we're here

59
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,300
mainly

60
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,040
uh and this tends to lead like this

61
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,459
problem tends to lead to a lot of I've

62
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:24,900
cut almost like what you're going to see

63
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,099
on the next slide is almost like a toll

64
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:27,360
of like all these different things that

65
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,580
I've heard in draft exit meetings when

66
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,840
we're going over our pen test Report

67
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,040
with clients

68
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,959
especially if they're well that when

69
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:36,000
they're all first-time clients

70
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,120
so but we let you in right so like we're

71
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,099
doing an assumed breach pen test we

72
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:42,840
explain that to them but then

73
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,220
stakeholders are in the room at the end

74
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,720
of the pen test we're going over the

75
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,920
meeting maybe there's like internal

76
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,780
audit in there maybe there's a sea level

77
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,280
person in there whoever it may be and

78
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,900
they're like yeah but we let you in

79
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,040
it's like

80
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,840
yeah but didn't anybody you've had this

81
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,760
done before so apparently nobody's ever

82
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,500
explained this process to you very well

83
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,019
in the past

84
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:03,540
that's not a realistic scenario we hear

85
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,400
that a lot

86
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,019
um it's like well it's an assumed reach

87
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:08,519
so a lot of that maybe not it's not a

88
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:10,260
realistic scenario but that's not it's

89
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,180
also kind of missing the point uh our

90
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,340
mssp would have stopped you this is one

91
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,019
of my favorites

92
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:17,879
uh this report does not adequately

93
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,519
adequately reflect our environment

94
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:22,560
we've had a lot of calls in this process

95
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,360
and there's plenty of time for people to

96
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,159
tell us these things but again if they

97
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,680
haven't been through a good process of

98
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,140
of a pen test objective then maybe these

99
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,640
people have people never like brought

100
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,599
these things up to them or asked them

101
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,980
questions before

102
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,680
uh but we're tracking that issue there's

103
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,900
another one our report was clean last

104
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,879
year well depending upon who you went

105
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,260
with last year I'm not might not be

106
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,000
surprising

107
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,739
so

108
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:48,420
uh why didn't the previous funder find

109
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,580
this this is like

110
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,080
one of the funniest questions ever

111
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,879
because we can't answer that question

112
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,860
obviously we're not the previous vendor

113
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,200
uh and we're certainly not gonna go down

114
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,580
some rabbit hole of trying to find out

115
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,659
the answers to that because now we're

116
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:02,159
just crapping on another vendor and

117
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,560
we're never actually know the truth

118
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,080
so to kind of like paint this picture a

119
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,459
little bit I've got a couple scenarios

120
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:10,620
here and these are real world examples

121
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,599
that are kind of like obviously no names

122
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:14,879
but there's like a bunch of these that

123
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,320
all kind of fit into these two scenarios

124
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,358
that we've seen so company A's

125
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,160
Regulators require an annual pen test

126
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,440
does anybody in here regulated and

127
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,060
require an annual benefit

128
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,180
a few people okay

129
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,280
the big leagues do not get security so

130
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,500
there's not a ton of budget for this

131
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,080
those same people similar problems no I

132
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,940
don't know

133
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,080
okay

134
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,340
so the company ends up looking for a

135
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,419
cheap vendor because they don't have a

136
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:41,759
lot of money right

137
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,500
uh and there's a ton of them to choose

138
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,060
from at the price point I want to pay

139
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,740
have you ever Googled and like looked up

140
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,960
like Google pen testing services and

141
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,280
like one of the first Google ads is like

142
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,400
99 pen test like

143
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,780
like

144
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,699
and that's like the First full page of

145
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:58,020
Google results not just the first couple

146
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,280
ads

147
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,720
uh so they picked the one that's like

148
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,780
close to the cheapest right

149
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,159
who wants to guess how this turns out

150
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:09,900
pretty much

151
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,919
big old dumpster fire

152
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,740
uh so the pen test finishes and the

153
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,500
report looks like this

154
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,080
First Option there's no or few findings

155
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,880
so I'm going to keep asking questions to

156
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,440
this audience how many times have you

157
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,240
gotten a pen test report back and

158
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,699
there's like a high for like

159
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:33,180
TLS 1.0 or like SSL V3 and use and like

160
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,400
that's all they have in the report okay

161
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,620
you're with me awesome

162
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,180
the other option

163
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,100
who's gotten the massive spreadsheet

164
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,440
dump and then the people just like walk

165
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,539
out the door and say like clean yourself

166
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:47,780
off

167
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,060
uh now company a has either a false

168
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,680
sense of security which is not good

169
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,820
obviously

170
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,860
uh or new job openings because everybody

171
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,500
quit after you slam the ID Department

172
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,060
with that massive spreadsheet and say

173
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,800
fix all this stuff we have no idea how

174
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,240
important any of it is but just fix it

175
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,120
so why did this happen

176
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,620
right

177
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,740
so as we mentioned there's lack of

178
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,460
buy-in from the top right uh which leads

179
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,580
to a lack of budget right to go with a

180
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,860
better vendor

181
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:26,639
which also leads to a crappy vendor

182
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,639
which leads to poor work false positives

183
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,300
or even worse false negatives right

184
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,880
leading to a false sense of security

185
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,560
unnecessary work that people now have to

186
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,139
do I mean there's so many times where

187
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:41,280
you know we go into smaller

188
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,900
organizations where there's like the I.T

189
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,800
guy the security guy uh the the whoever

190
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,539
other network admin whoever may be and

191
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:50,520
those are all the same person right and

192
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,620
they just got hit with what's arguably

193
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,240
potentially another six months to a

194
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,440
Year's worth of work

195
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,300
because for no good reason if they get

196
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,440
slammed with one of these spreadsheets

197
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,660
right because the Top's like oh well you

198
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,160
got to fix all this stuff like we had a

199
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,840
pen test so now you got to go fix all

200
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,100
this stuff and they're like I hate my

201
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,220
life

202
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:09,840
reach right

203
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,160
potentially

204
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,479
so this will happen again next time

205
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,659
right

206
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,599
so here's the other scenario I was going

207
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,819
to mention uh so Company B

208
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,560
Regulators also require the pen test

209
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,979
right Finance maybe maybe I don't know

210
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:30,360
if I can't remember

211
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,340
uh in the bigwigs here understand

212
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,720
security right maybe they've gone

213
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,940
through uh previous vendors that helped

214
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,380
them walk through the process kind of

215
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,699
handheld them through that to help them

216
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:40,560
understand how it's supposed to go

217
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,460
uh the company does research right they

218
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,340
send out rfps right to a few with good

219
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,960
track records like they know how to

220
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,419
actually search and find like okay I've

221
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:53,880
asked maybe competitors maybe have gone

222
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,440
to a conference like a healthcare or a

223
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,759
finance conference Financial conference

224
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:58,979
whatever and I ask people like who do

225
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,300
you use like how's it going in the past

226
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,919
right like they're asking these

227
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,099
questions

228
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:07,199
there are surprisingly very few of these

229
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,000
to choose from I mean I feel like it's

230
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,280
growing but like like the good ones are

231
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,660
there's more and more of them out there

232
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,099
but I think everybody in this company

233
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:15,660
knows who some of the good ones are

234
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,919
right

235
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:18,360
and there's not

236
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,860
I mean I've never had to purchase a pen

237
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,060
test myself but I don't feel like

238
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,039
there's a whole big bunch to choose from

239
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,819
so they pick one that makes sense for

240
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:28,379
them right based on their research

241
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:31,080
process based on the price point based

242
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,399
on what they need done and the expertise

243
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,020
of whoever they may go to go with

244
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,020
once you guys how this turns out

245
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,860
yay

246
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,240
so

247
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,580
the pen test finishes the report comes

248
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,040
out right and there's option A right

249
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,300
validated useful information so

250
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,140
Maybe

251
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,240
a NASA scan or something like that

252
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,740
happens in the middle of a pen test

253
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,839
right there's there's obviously like a

254
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:02,940
use case for that especially if it's

255
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,940
your first time at a client and you

256
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,140
don't know what their environment looks

257
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,240
like they have a massive scope and

258
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,980
unfortunately the amount of time you

259
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,080
were given isn't massive to go with the

260
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,240
scope of work right so like okay how do

261
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,380
I give them the most value out of this

262
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,120
like I'm not gonna no pen test is gonna

263
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,920
find everything right everything's

264
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,620
changing all the time so maybe there's

265
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,959
that spreadsheet but they took that

266
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,000
spreadsheet they went through it didn't

267
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,620
make you go through it right as the

268
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,040
buyer or as the client and I went okay

269
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,860
this critical that's related to some

270
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,140
like processor like issue or something

271
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,000
like that like nessus calling this

272
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,620
critical but like I know it's probably

273
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,360
not that big of a deal however what's

274
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,580
calling this is calling like SMB signing

275
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,040
and informational or like llmnr or

276
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,000
something like that on your network and

277
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,980
informational to me that's way higher up

278
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,779
so we can help prioritize those things

279
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:53,820
and if it's a pen test we're actually

280
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,980
proving why right we're not just saying

281
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,779
theoretically all of this is a problem

282
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:01,860
go fix it right sort of proving risk

283
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,540
um and this like helps the company and

284
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,740
make good decisions about where to spend

285
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,480
money right so

286
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,940
we have

287
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,980
some junior staff not necessarily on my

288
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,640
team will sometimes make a finding about

289
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,860
a company not having like a Nack

290
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,360
solution in place

291
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,820
right and it's like we also have clients

292
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,279
that will then

293
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,260
same client obviously I'm not going to

294
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,519
name them but every year we come back

295
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:27,600
and they're like yeah but we have a

296
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,160
knack it's like every time something

297
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,200
happens they're like they're literally

298
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,519
every single time every management

299
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,380
response is yeah we have a knack but we

300
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,660
have a knack and it's like okay right

301
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,620
like

302
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,420
maybe that's on us because we didn't

303
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,980
make the point of like like some Junior

304
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,600
auditor at some point was like hey well

305
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,800
you don't have an ax so I'm gonna write

306
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,880
you up for that and then they go out and

307
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,740
buy one and now they think that that's

308
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,820
literally going to like make them

309
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,800
breakfast lunch dinner like keep out

310
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,680
every single apt like it's like dude I

311
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,060
land a fishing payload on an endpoint

312
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,760
you're not going to do anything for you

313
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,019
but

314
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:00,300
this does this does theoretically help

315
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,380
people make better decisions about

316
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,940
buying we're also not going to be like

317
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,399
hey after this pen test let us also tell

318
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:06,540
you all of these things you should buy

319
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,160
and go through these these vendors

320
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,480
because we like them and stuff right but

321
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,820
we still have to inform that help inform

322
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,980
those decisions uh it builds confidence

323
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,380
in the company's people right so like if

324
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,240
you have it's way better if you come in

325
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,800
and you do like a legit

326
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,019
legit legit pen test like good work you

327
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:23,279
help them you hand hold them through it

328
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,480
you tell them how it's all supposed to

329
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,060
work and now they have the confidence to

330
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,160
be like okay like I this is not the

331
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,440
massive bite and like out of my life

332
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,459
that I thought it was going to be

333
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:34,860
anymore like this is manageable like I

334
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,720
can explain it up and down my chain of

335
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,880
command right whoever that whoever that

336
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,740
whoever that uh that client is that

337
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,540
we're interfacing with whoever their POC

338
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,000
is

339
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,680
uh and sometimes like like I was saying

340
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,440
like that llmr versus some bug in a

341
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,519
process and a chip or something like

342
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:51,420
that

343
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,880
it informs those stakeholders and like

344
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,040
day-to-day staff like how to maybe like

345
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,899
rethink like what things they should be

346
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:00,060
paying attention to so like

347
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,800
I mean when I say lmnr how many people

348
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,060
know what I'm talking about

349
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,820
yeah I guess it's a scary conversation

350
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,560
but I've given this talk one other place

351
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,420
to other places and there's a lot of

352
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,680
people that are not necessarily like

353
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,000
technical folks and they have no idea

354
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,140
what I'm talking about but they should

355
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,000
because that's a big problem to still be

356
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,760
on your network right or SMB signing or

357
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,680
SMB version one all the hits right

358
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,060
so in a way it's in a way we're almost

359
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,560
helping them think like an attacker

360
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,060
whereas that's not necessarily how they

361
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,200
typically think

362
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,000
uh and there is no option b because it

363
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,899
went well

364
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:33,320
right

365
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,120
so now they have this point of reference

366
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,640
right like obviously we want a client to

367
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,579
go with us every year until we're dead

368
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:42,959
or they're not a company anymore right

369
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,320
we want them to always go with us but if

370
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,880
they don't if we do it one year and like

371
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,320
sometimes these plays like oh every

372
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,700
three years we have to rotate vendors

373
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,920
because you just have to like the top

374
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,560
the top says we have to do that

375
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,180
um at least now like

376
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,800
as long as we're doing a good job or

377
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,240
whoever that vendor is that came in that

378
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,279
time and did that good job now they know

379
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,139
like what tool that they should expect

380
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:06,000
going forward and what they should be

381
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,180
getting out of a pen test right so they

382
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,459
have a better frame of reference

383
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:13,500
and now they have a team that there's so

384
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,600
many times where

385
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,120
we come in we do we do you know a good

386
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,639
job right and then the people who were

387
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,320
initially when we came in the door never

388
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,820
met us before they're like

389
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,279
you're going to add pain to my life I

390
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,079
don't like you right

391
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,000
and then by the end of it they're like

392
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,920
okay like I get what you're trying to

393
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,360
help us do here right like if you're not

394
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,399
trying to ruin our lives with like a

395
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,779
massive spreadsheet you're not trying to

396
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:39,000
call a stupid to our bosses you're not

397
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,680
going hahaha I got domain administrator

398
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,360
and like walking out the door right like

399
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,860
you're actually like you're proving

400
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,760
something to them and you're helping

401
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,019
you're helping hand hold them through

402
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:47,339
the process of things they're more into

403
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:49,079
it the next time you come back but

404
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,339
wherever that vendor is that comes back

405
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:51,839
next time right

406
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,639
and there's less likelihood of an acid

407
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:56,040
breach here right I mean what's the the

408
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,480
thing that everybody's like oh don't say

409
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,220
it's impossible to give or you're always

410
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,060
going to get breached because then

411
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,500
people will be like why try but at least

412
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,779
there's less likelihood fast he preach

413
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,139
and I'm blowing through this so

414
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:13,680
I'll slow down so takeaways from this

415
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,360
uh don't shop for the lowest cost

416
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,060
provider if you cannot or if you if you

417
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,680
have the option if you have the budget

418
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,959
right I see that guy from aeon over here

419
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:23,820
he's just like yeah everything dude he's

420
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,660
a pen tester he gets it

421
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,920
um

422
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,959
look into the vendors you're considering

423
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,880
right so

424
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,440
what's interesting to me and I didn't

425
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,200
realize this as a pen tester I went to

426
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,180
has anybody ever been a wildless hacking

427
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,420
Fest

428
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,320
so I was at the one in San Diego

429
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,060
and here you go yeah Kevin Johnson was

430
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,740
there from secure ideas and he's giving

431
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,820
us talk

432
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,000
uh I don't name names about vendors I

433
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,300
don't like he names all the names I'm

434
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,459
like it's hilarious

435
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:01,019
um but

436
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:03,600
you know he's talking through you know a

437
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,980
similar some of the things that I'm

438
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,420
touching on

439
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,519
right and he's like I went up to him

440
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:10,139
after and he's like

441
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:11,399
he because he had said something he's

442
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:13,680
like you should be able to get a sample

443
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,019
report from like any given vendor that

444
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:17,399
you're gonna go to to see like how they

445
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:20,160
do their work and I like we do that but

446
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,019
I didn't dawn on me that like the Black

447
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:23,639
Hills of the world The Trusted sex like

448
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:25,079
all the big players like yeah if you ask

449
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:26,940
I'll just give you a sample report to

450
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,800
look at right whether you're going to be

451
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,600
a client or not like I emailed them just

452
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,800
to prove this just to prove this out

453
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,079
like yeah sure you go it's like that's a

454
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,120
huge that's a lot of value there for if

455
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,440
you're going to buy a pen test to figure

456
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,180
out like what you're gonna get and even

457
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,440
if you don't necessarily know how to

458
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,339
read it like you there's probably

459
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:42,899
somebody who you know that does and can

460
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:44,040
it kind of explain to you like what's

461
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,440
good bad or otherwise

462
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,000
um and then that's that's a lot of

463
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,740
that's like a one little piece of

464
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,300
research that probably makes a huge

465
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,980
difference right so look into I'm just

466
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,540
using as an example like look into who

467
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,899
you're gonna buy

468
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,420
uh ask for references

469
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,860
so

470
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,160
we don't get asked for references a lot

471
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,560
but you should ask for references right

472
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,540
um sometimes you do sometimes usually we

473
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,000
don't but more people should probably be

474
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,920
asking for references when they're gonna

475
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,959
engaged with somebody during an RFP

476
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:18,240
process like okay who who likes you that

477
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,000
will talk to us about you right

478
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,839
um

479
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,820
it's just more it's kind of like a job

480
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,139
interview if you think about it right

481
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:26,760
like You're Gonna Want references you're

482
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,800
not just going to hire someone like not

483
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,940
knowing anything about them except for

484
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,199
what's on their resume and say oh cool

485
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,760
you know 17 different programming

486
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,980
languages I believe you

487
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:38,100
we get a lot of those resumes

488
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,560
uh pay attention to communication

489
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,000
right

490
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,100
oh of the people who have bought pen

491
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,560
tests and engaged with others about pen

492
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,199
and having pen tests done

493
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,120
did you have

494
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,740
a pre-sales call a scope call and like

495
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,120
at least probably three separate calls

496
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,560
before they started doing that work like

497
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,899
was there any real from the pen testers

498
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:02,759
themselves was there any engagement

499
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,199
about like this is how we do everything

500
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:06,540
do you have questions uh what do you

501
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,980
actually want us to do for you like we

502
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,179
want to make sure that what was sold

503
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:10,740
matches what you want us one done

504
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,000
because sometimes the people in the room

505
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,559
are different people like did you get a

506
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:15,720
good sense of did that happen for you I

507
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,740
know there's a few people in the package

508
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,140
that they bought pen test yeah all right

509
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,620
that's good

510
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:24,720
do they tell you about their process

511
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,780
right so they're probably not going to

512
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,280
tell you that they're just going to run

513
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,260
necessing call today right but at least

514
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,120
you can start asking and be like

515
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,799
tell me about like what you are going to

516
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,539
do like do you I think that's actually

517
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:38,400
one of my bullets

518
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,600
maybe not

519
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,419
do you run an essay scan right and if so

520
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:43,980
what does that do what are you using

521
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,140
that for does it and don't give them the

522
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,340
answer I'll be like does it inform your

523
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,559
results or does it not like what are you

524
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:51,120
going to do like just be like so do you

525
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,860
run a scan if so why right

526
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:57,179
um and were you given an idea of like

527
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:58,500
who's going to be actually doing the

528
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,520
work for you right so

529
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,539
something I didn't realize recently

530
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:05,340
until recently

531
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,919
so like I said we're a CPA firm 170

532
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,200
years old right our group has been like

533
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,880
a real cohesive unit for probably like

534
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,760
five to ten years I had to guess

535
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,080
um

536
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,860
and we're all W-2 employees right at our

537
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,660
organization we worked there and we work

538
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,059
directly for clients I had no idea a

539
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:27,539
vast number of CPA firms that will have

540
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:29,580
penetration testing services on their

541
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,740
website and just 10.99 at all out and

542
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,600
you have no idea it's actually happening

543
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,000
in the background and I that creeps me

544
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,039
out I'm sorry I don't know so like ask

545
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:39,780
because those people in my opinion don't

546
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,039
have

547
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,100
the same level of Gusto right than like

548
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,840
an actual employee is going to that is

549
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,160
like really gonna dig in and like that's

550
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,539
all they're focusing on right they're

551
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:50,280
not doing like five different pen tests

552
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,360
of all different types at the same time

553
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,919
and you're one of them do you have

554
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:53,940
questions

555
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,140
yeah sure so

556
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,460
um

557
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,799
foreign

558
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,480
no I think there should be level one

559
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,280
level two people for sure

560
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,380
um what I'm saying is what I'm saying is

561
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,340
like

562
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,860
those people should work for you like

563
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,840
like they should work for us like right

564
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,520
we don't want to like in the shadows be

565
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,980
like I don't know anybody doing 1099

566
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,600
work come on over like do this because

567
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,160
we don't have time right I'm not gonna

568
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,840
lie like we've done that before but we

569
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,280
tell the client we're doing it right

570
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,140
like look there's this guy that we know

571
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,700
who's good at like mobile app work right

572
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,679
we didn't have that uh function or

573
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:54,059
facility we didn't really have that

574
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,799
skill set until recently

575
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:58,559
but so there were we had good references

576
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,360
we knew this guy right we had people

577
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,679
that used to work with them before and

578
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,360
we would tell clients like hey by the

579
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,220
way he's the one going to do the mobile

580
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,780
app work I'm like okay fine like it's

581
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,059
it's transparent right A lot of times

582
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:10,620
it's not from what I'm told and actually

583
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,480
he told me that he's like you have you

584
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,220
guys you guys are one of the only firms

585
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,140
I know of that actually in-house pen

586
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,000
testers like that's that's actually like

587
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,160
a CPA like public accounting type firm

588
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,020
I'm not directly a security company

589
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,640
income right

590
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,200
um but the level one level twos I mean

591
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,299
we have those right and they're on jobs

592
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:29,520
and sometimes they're given too much

593
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,160
they're given a little bit too much uh

594
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,200
responsibility on those jobs but like

595
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,600
myself and Alex we're the ones who are

596
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,760
doing the best we can to make sure that

597
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,919
they're like not butting off too much if

598
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:41,760
they're going through the training they

599
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,720
need to go through that they're going

600
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,480
through uh scope calls with us right

601
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,220
we're not just being like oh you've been

602
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,299
here for two weeks you just take the

603
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:49,799
scope call you do this you do that right

604
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:51,179
like they need like

605
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:52,860
they need that exposure to like learn

606
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,780
how to not talk like a robot on a call

607
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,059
because they're nervous or you know

608
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:58,260
lacking confidence because they're new

609
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,580
or something like that right so you got

610
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,660
to help build that up does that answer

611
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,080
the question

612
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,400
right

613
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,460
now

614
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,080
yeah I mean the

615
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,059
it's funny because like

616
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:22,799
people have to start somewhere you know

617
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,559
I mean so it's like the everybody knows

618
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:26,940
trust attack Black Hills do you think

619
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,200
that everybody there is like a senior

620
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,640
penetration tester like you know what I

621
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,380
mean it's like everybody's starting at

622
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,840
some point and it's it's up to them to

623
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,039
make sure the team is formed correctly

624
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,780
so that the level one guy doesn't you

625
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,980
know like screw something up and there's

626
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,720
no accountability right but everybody

627
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,940
has to stare somewhere

628
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,539
so

629
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,799
by the way if there's quite well good I

630
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:47,580
was just going to say if there's

631
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,899
questions feel free to interrupt me

632
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,220
right

633
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,459
no

634
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,320
right

635
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,039
and that's

636
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,340
so for the

637
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,080
for the recording I should have like

638
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,240
restated these questions so the point

639
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,059
being made is no no no the point being

640
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:50,520
made is you got to like rotate in the

641
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,500
the junior guys to make sure that

642
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,880
there's somebody for later and building

643
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,280
on security right so when it comes to

644
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,640
that like those level one people

645
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,220
um they're often like the hungriest too

646
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,419
right because they're just like very

647
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:05,340
eager to learn they're and and if you

648
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,840
don't give them those at-bats and don't

649
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,460
give them then they're just gonna either

650
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,780
they're gonna like flake out or they're

651
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,520
not gonna quit or then you've got a

652
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,200
turnover problem or whatever

653
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,740
the back

654
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,220
99

655
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,919
uh and it depends right like

656
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:24,539
there's discounts given all over the

657
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:26,280
place right I mean for sometimes like

658
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,820
new clients like they my like Senior

659
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,260
Management will be like hey can you read

660
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,299
this engagement letter to make sure that

661
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:35,580
I didn't say something stupid in it or

662
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,140
you know is there enough hours in it

663
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,179
things like that right I'll be like look

664
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:41,039
maybe you're under you might be under by

665
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,840
like 10 to 15 hours here and they're

666
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,220
like look take the time you need but

667
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,600
like their new client

668
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,460
they're they they're having faith in us

669
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,419
like we'll give them a little bit of a

670
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:50,700
discount on Price Right But like I don't

671
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:54,000
want to say like this a pen test like

672
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,799
like a assumed breach internal pen test

673
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:57,659
should always cost x amount of money

674
00:23:57,659 --> 00:23:58,919
because it always depends on like the

675
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:00,659
client's environment like I know that

676
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:02,820
there's some actually here's another

677
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:06,539
question in your when you get engagement

678
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:08,460
letters do they say the specific number

679
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,280
of Ip like up to X number of ips to be

680
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,840
tested that still happens

681
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:17,460
uh we can talk about that later I'm not

682
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,740
a huge fan uh because it's like I'm if

683
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,539
I'm looking at an active directory

684
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:23,940
environment and there's five hosts in it

685
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,940
or like 150 hosts in it

686
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,980
it's I'm not going to go through each

687
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,780
host and like try to run like I don't

688
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,100
know Eternal blue exploit against it

689
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,480
right like you're you're supposed to

690
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,679
more holistic thing going on there so

691
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:37,440
like I don't care if it's 500 105 IPS

692
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,200
like as the tester right

693
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,620
so

694
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,900
so let's go back through those initial

695
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,220
things I was talking about with all the

696
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,480
all the things that we get in like those

697
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,340
exit meetings

698
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:53,400
so but we let you in right so

699
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,700
in our engagement letters in our

700
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,799
executive summaries right at the front

701
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,419
on the front page it talks about what an

702
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:01,980
assumed breach pen test is just to make

703
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,179
sure that it's Crystal Clear we talk

704
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:04,980
about it on scope calls right

705
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:08,820
so if you can't if a pen test company

706
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,740
cannot explain to you

707
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:13,260
the difference between like an outside

708
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,240
in or like an istoon breach pen test

709
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,740
like that's kind of a problem because

710
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:19,080
that client is going to have a very hard

711
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,140
time believing how good better otherwise

712
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,640
your findings are if they don't

713
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,320
understand even the context of what

714
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,039
happened

715
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:28,520
right

716
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:32,340
that's not a realistic scenario if they

717
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,600
performed a phone scan and called a pen

718
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,520
test you're 100 right about that

719
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,140
so

720
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,880
yeah it's not necessarily a realistic

721
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,039
scenario but I mean again I have like I

722
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,419
was talking about the client that thinks

723
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:44,100
that their Knack is going to save them

724
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,480
Leonard no matter what happens The Knack

725
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,740
is there

726
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,860
right so they like to say that what we

727
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,480
did is not a realistic scenario all the

728
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,059
time and we always have to push back and

729
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:56,159
say yeah but you know somebody Landing a

730
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,620
fishing pilot on an endpoint that's a

731
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,360
trusted endpoint you know what I mean

732
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,640
like that's already allow listed through

733
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,580
your controls to an extent so you have

734
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,779
to keep

735
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:08,340
some clients you just have to keep hand

736
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,799
holding and that's fine

737
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,480
that's fine our mssp would have stopped

738
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,559
you well did you tell them we were

739
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:14,700
coming

740
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,100
right I would advise you not to but

741
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,200
that's your decision and if not why

742
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,640
didn't they stop us

743
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,860
oh or at least alert

744
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:26,640
so I'm gonna take this moment to

745
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,880
go on a little bit of a rant about mssps

746
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,559
so anybody that works for an mssp in

747
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:33,799
this room

748
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,840
in the back so the the first time I gave

749
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,900
this talk I did my little tirade and

750
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,039
then somebody asked a question and he's

751
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:45,360
like just so you know half of this room

752
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,899
is mssp

753
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:49,980
it was fine I mean they agreed with me

754
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,140
to a large extent but

755
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:55,080
right exactly no I mean I didn't name

756
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,279
anybody but everybody knows what I'm

757
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:58,620
talking about so

758
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,179
it drives me

759
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:02,580
personally insane and to the point where

760
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,559
it's a finding in our reports now in

761
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,120
almost every report

762
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,340
and not because I'm blaming a client for

763
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,559
this but

764
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,440
if we run if we go into an environment

765
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,740
and we run Bloodhound right we try to

766
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,380
curb a roast uh or men in the middling

767
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,740
16 ways from Sunday uh we're doing the

768
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,860
new fangled adcs attacks right he taught

769
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,659
him all that good stuff

770
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:29,760
and map scanning right and like they

771
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,440
have pretty much no alerts or if they do

772
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,720
have an alert it's like just random

773
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,640
email they get from whoever the provider

774
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,520
is that has like this encoded Powershell

775
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,640
and it's like this is a high alert what

776
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,260
is it like what happened like you're not

777
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,520
giving me anything to work with there as

778
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,080
a client right we see it all the time

779
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,480
and it's like we I can't even count how

780
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,100
many times I've asked hey like we want

781
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,299
alerts from you so we can give you

782
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:53,400
credit for for that on the report right

783
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,559
because obviously if I have like three

784
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:57,960
highs on a critical and you caught every

785
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,360
single thing I did like along that that

786
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,580
chain right then like I could probably

787
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,620
rate those a little lower because you

788
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,600
caught it right if you didn't it's gonna

789
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,740
be there's gonna be a lot more red in

790
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,820
that report

791
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,220
right so I can't even count how many

792
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,080
times I ask like okay can I have words

793
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,360
and they send me literally like a 55

794
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,059
page PDF of events

795
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:20,220
and I'm like this is not this no and

796
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,380
it's like you can have this back now

797
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:25,679
like I need an alert right and so the

798
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,960
reason I'm on the soapbox right now is

799
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,260
because there's so many times where we

800
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,880
go in and we're like okay there weren't

801
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,080
enough alerts for this Saturday maybe

802
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,220
you caught a couple things here and

803
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,000
there

804
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,799
I remember there was one time we did

805
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,480
something like really vicious and

806
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,299
because the mssp didn't hear back from

807
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:44,220
them in 24 hours they closed the ticket

808
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,559
and it pretended it never happened I'm

809
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:47,520
like

810
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,120
go ahead

811
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,059
yeah

812
00:28:57,059 --> 00:28:59,460
right

813
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,760
right

814
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:07,380
what wow

815
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,559
okay

816
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:13,140
that's aggressive wow

817
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:16,260
that's a new one I've heard that before

818
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,039
um

819
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,020
where was I going with that but yeah so

820
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,700
the the reason for all of that and the

821
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,899
reason we put it as a finding in a

822
00:29:21,899 --> 00:29:23,820
report and it I'll be honest it pisses

823
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,500
clients off we put it in there is

824
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,520
because

825
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,440
I'm not it's not necessarily like your

826
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,659
fault like you're paying a stupid amount

827
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:32,580
of money for this service and it's not

828
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,260
really doing anything like you have to

829
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,940
like kick it to like make it do anything

830
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,100
for you it's like basically the whole

831
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,600
point of this finding is to pick up the

832
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,380
phone

833
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,539
call whoever your like contact is over

834
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:44,580
there and sales or like your CSM or

835
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,200
whatever it is and be like hey we had

836
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,059
this pen test done they did all this

837
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:49,559
super low hanging fruit stuff and I got

838
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:51,360
nothing out of you right like you're

839
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,500
paying for something like maybe they

840
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,000
don't have the Telemetry they need maybe

841
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,919
they don't have uh the network senses

842
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,179
where they're supposed to be right maybe

843
00:29:57,179 --> 00:29:59,039
that you're not collecting logs from

844
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,140
like every single workstation or maybe

845
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:03,419
it's just servers or member servers

846
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:04,740
right if it's only domain controllers

847
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:07,080
it's a much bigger problem but like

848
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,899
have that conversation right maybe

849
00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:12,000
you've been there for two years and

850
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,440
whoever was there before you bought it

851
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,899
five years ago right and there's like no

852
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:17,039
transition of like what this thing's

853
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,240
actually supposed to be doing for you or

854
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,340
the service that you paid in some cases

855
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,360
probably hundreds of thousands of

856
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,039
dollars is supposed to be doing for you

857
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,380
okay like it's because we want them to

858
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,880
have that conversation and then if they

859
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,039
take it seriously when we come back it's

860
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,899
like a Christmas tree right but they're

861
00:30:30,899 --> 00:30:32,279
even their inbox is like learn on this

862
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:34,380
word on that and that that's the point

863
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,179
right to get to that stage

864
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:37,860
all right I'm gonna get off my soapbox

865
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,158
now

866
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:44,399
this report does not adequately reflect

867
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:45,720
our environment

868
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,419
so last time that they ask you about the

869
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:49,620
environment before they started poking

870
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,899
away like okay like give me a brief

871
00:30:51,899 --> 00:30:53,460
rundown of what you got here what do you

872
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:57,120
got for EDR what do you got for IDs IPS

873
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,740
whatever it may be like where are your

874
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:01,020
firewalls right like who is your mssp

875
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,179
like let's talk this through

876
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:04,620
um to figure out you know what we're

877
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,000
looking at before we go in because we

878
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,779
might know you know like okay we have a

879
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:11,940
crowdstrike uh

880
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,799
falcon complete or whatever right so now

881
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:15,720
I know okay well crowdstrike should be

882
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,159
picking up the phone left and right when

883
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:18,960
I'm touching these endpoints right

884
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,059
what was it I'm gonna ask Alex was it

885
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:24,240
like a week ago we had you ran some like

886
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,779
on like not encoded like sliver payload

887
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:28,919
or something on an endpoint and

888
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:30,360
Crosstrack didn't do anything

889
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,059
that's very very strange like that's

890
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:34,919
another one pick up the phone hey this

891
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:37,740
happened right like you got C2 outbound

892
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,419
in the middle of like a threat emulation

893
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:40,980
it wasn't even a pen test or like a red

894
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,260
team and like nothing happens it's kind

895
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,480
of strange

896
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,020
um

897
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,760
and did they check in right were they

898
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,020
checking in throughout the same page

899
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,120
like we write status updates like every

900
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,799
day except for Monday that we start

901
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,179
right because we're kind of just getting

902
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:55,559
our feet wet in the environment but it's

903
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:57,120
like Tuesday Monday Thursday Friday and

904
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,260
if it's a one week engagement there's an

905
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,220
exit meeting if it's a two week

906
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,480
engagement there's a next meeting at the

907
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,640
end of the two weeks right to go through

908
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,740
this and make sure that when I give them

909
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,600
a report that God forbid has like five

910
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,640
criticals in it they're not like what

911
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,440
the hell is this like they saw it coming

912
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,000
they knew what was going to happen

913
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:19,020
uh but we're tracking that issue okay

914
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,940
well if you're tracking that issue we

915
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,020
need to know about that somebody should

916
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,340
have asked like hey do you have like a

917
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,140
risk tracking Matrix and things you've

918
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,520
signed off on and accepted or that

919
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,600
you're working on it'll be done in

920
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:32,159
fiscal year whatever quarter two right

921
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,200
our report was clean last year probably

922
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,840
because your company a right had the

923
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:40,459
phone scan and called it a pen test

924
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:42,480
that those are hard conversations to

925
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,120
have right like when you come in and you

926
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,860
do what I would like to think is a good

927
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:47,700
job

928
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,880
at up with us and the levia gave you the

929
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,140
last year report and like I said there's

930
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,840
that like SSL V3 TLS version one like hi

931
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,520
critical whatever finding it in that's

932
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,000
all they found

933
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:00,659
um

934
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:03,000
did they tell you about the process

935
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,460
right I already talked about the process

936
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,380
uh it's an impossible question to answer

937
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,299
like I don't I don't know like why did

938
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:10,919
the previous offender not find this

939
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:12,179
that's an impossible question to answer

940
00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:14,279
but we get asked that question right and

941
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:15,360
it's like

942
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,240
I don't know all I know is that we did

943
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,580
and that's a good thing because now you

944
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,899
can fix it before somebody really

945
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:24,979
somebody else finds it

946
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,640
so here in my opinion are like this the

947
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,500
small group of things that you should be

948
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,760
asking these vendors if you're going to

949
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,380
buy a pen test right

950
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,240
like oh this is where I put the bullet

951
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,340
do you perform a vulvary vulnerability

952
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:41,039
scan as part of a pen test right and

953
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,700
what's it used for

954
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:45,720
do you attempt exploitational

955
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,640
vulnerabilities found

956
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,919
this is a big one right because I feel

957
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,679
like well no then that's a freaking

958
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:54,659
vulnerability assessment right that's

959
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:56,279
not a fantastic but there is no active

960
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:59,940
exploitation right then that you didn't

961
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:03,200
get a pen you're not getting a pen test

962
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,700
how much of your testing focus on an Ed

963
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:10,859
and identity platforms right so we have

964
00:34:10,859 --> 00:34:13,440
a big client California

965
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,020
we came in for our first year last year

966
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,839
their previous year's vendor this place

967
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:22,020
is a 15 billion dollar Bank

968
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:25,080
anybody want to guess how many internal

969
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,780
hosts were in scope for this assumed

970
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:30,300
reach pen test

971
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,520
close

972
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,320
20.

973
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,659
none of them were domain joined

974
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:38,520
we saw the scope it wasn't supposed to

975
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,379
be like this is a specific application

976
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:42,300
that only rests on these servers like

977
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,619
there was no

978
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:45,899
documentation or state or statement of

979
00:34:45,899 --> 00:34:48,000
that anywhere in this report it's just

980
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,800
like did an internal pen test RC 20 host

981
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,480
we kind of like what's in scope and

982
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,440
they're like well here's last year's

983
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,879
scope and I literally said I'm like

984
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:56,940
that's not the scope like I want your

985
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:59,220
active directory host right like I want

986
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:02,280
uh iot like everything that's not going

987
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,980
to like burn the building down if we

988
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,839
poke at it you know like any any Legacy

989
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:07,920
stuff like

990
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,300
ideally everything should be in scope

991
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,460
right but like I I'm not asking you to

992
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,680
give me literally like everything but

993
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,839
like a representative sample of what

994
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:17,400
your environment is and if something bad

995
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,560
happened to it so I so that I can prove

996
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,480
rescue right

997
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,460
and big surprise there were like no

998
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,980
findings of the of the prior year report

999
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,020
and the report we gave them was like

1000
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,339
this thick and they weren't happy about

1001
00:35:29,339 --> 00:35:31,320
it but they're back which is good right

1002
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,339
we're building that relationship

1003
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:38,339
also X so I'm gonna ask another question

1004
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:39,900
when you've had a pen test done let's

1005
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,000
say it's an external pen test right so

1006
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,380
they're trying to like knock through the

1007
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,599
perimeters in one way or another if you

1008
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,040
ever had a pen test that came back like

1009
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,720
we ran tenable

1010
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,420
and we had all informationals in the

1011
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,980
tenable scan because the firewall seems

1012
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,720
to be doing what it's supposed to uh and

1013
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,880
we found some DNS subdomains we didn't

1014
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,859
find anything on them you clean does

1015
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:00,240
that ever happened

1016
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,160
yes all right

1017
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,079
they should be like

1018
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,740
my in my mind nowadays like an external

1019
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:10,020
pen test the first thing I think about

1020
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,480
is like do you have Microsoft 365

1021
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,000
do you have Azure do you have AWS like G

1022
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,920
Suite like what like that is the

1023
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,540
perimeter so to speak like everybody

1024
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,560
talks about there's like no real

1025
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,420
perimeter anymore so like

1026
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,980
that's our opinion like that's the first

1027
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,359
thing we go after

1028
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:26,579
and it's like if Microsoft actually

1029
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:30,180
turns off Legacy protocols next month

1030
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,520
it's like it's been a great run we

1031
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,440
hardly knew you because it was like so

1032
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,180
much fun as a pen tester

1033
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:39,300
to play with Legacy protocols

1034
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,740
but I hope they do

1035
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,420
can we see a sample report I kind of

1036
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,680
went over this before but they should be

1037
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,240
able to provide you a sample report and

1038
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,760
ideally a sample report based on your

1039
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,520
specific like vertical like if you're a

1040
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,560
bank if you're creditable Credit Union

1041
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,359
Bank pretty similar as far as the

1042
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:57,420
reporting goes if you're a hospital

1043
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,579
system right like a private company

1044
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:02,520
whatever it may be

1045
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,020
or if they're going to buy like a web

1046
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,460
app test from you like you want to see a

1047
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:08,839
web app that's sample report

1048
00:37:10,339 --> 00:37:12,599
I went over this I hear testers

1049
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:15,060
employees or are they 1099ers right

1050
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,920
again there's apparently a lot more of

1051
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,839
this going on than I thought there was

1052
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:21,119
so in my opinion and it's not just

1053
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,619
because of an employee I just feel like

1054
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:24,660
when you work with people on a regular

1055
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:27,180
on like on a regular schedule every day

1056
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,339
part of a team you're kind of you're

1057
00:37:29,339 --> 00:37:32,040
collaborating like you all kind of you

1058
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,420
might not be on the same job together

1059
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,460
but you're helping each other with all

1060
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,780
of those jobs that each people are doing

1061
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,339
right like you have one cohesive unit

1062
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:39,420
that is actually

1063
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,820
cares to put everything they have into

1064
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:44,160
this set of work for like the month of

1065
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,578
the week or whatever

1066
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:49,920
uh wagon's ongoing training to your

1067
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,060
testers

1068
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,320
I mean you don't have to tell them your

1069
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,119
training budget but it's like all right

1070
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:56,460
do they are do they have like x amount

1071
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,320
of TPS they have to get is that Hands-On

1072
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,240
training right like

1073
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,920
I'll be honest like there's the whole

1074
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,619
ofcp thing where it's like

1075
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:06,660
we started to get

1076
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,640
rfps that are like your testers have to

1077
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,619
have their oscp or we're not going to

1078
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:12,300
work with you so we were held at

1079
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:15,359
gunpoint to look at our osceps

1080
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:16,859
um but you know I mean that's that's

1081
00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:18,480
training right there's so much training

1082
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,980
out there right now that you can do I

1083
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,839
mean there's a ton of it from beginner

1084
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:23,940
all the way up to like

1085
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:26,220
people are people are still learning you

1086
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,440
know from the training that like uh

1087
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,119
what's his name rostamouse is doing

1088
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:33,900
right like crto and like crto2 is it CRT

1089
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,160
02 is that what it's called yeah like

1090
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,960
there's always new stuff coming out and

1091
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,220
there should be

1092
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,599
people should be going through that you

1093
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:40,619
can't you should be able to listen on

1094
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:42,000
your Hodges and continue to do those

1095
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,500
work things change so fast

1096
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,280
I don't know why I put this in here

1097
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,540
what is your fishing if you're gonna do

1098
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,339
fishing if you're gonna pay something to

1099
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:55,800
do a fishing test right what does that

1100
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,839
look like how do you do that what is ask

1101
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,180
them what are your metrics that you

1102
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,800
think are the most important metrics

1103
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,780
when this is all said and done and if

1104
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:07,079
they say clicks tell them to go away

1105
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:08,220
right

1106
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,140
it's reporting like who reported how

1107
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,540
fast they report right like what is the

1108
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,040
process for if somebody does get a fish

1109
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,720
like is there a simple button they can

1110
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,920
hit do they have to forward it to an

1111
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,300
email address do you have to pick up the

1112
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,920
phone right these are all things that we

1113
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,240
figured out as part of a phishing test

1114
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,460
and clicks are like

1115
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,960
everybody clicks like if people are

1116
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,099
trained to click that's it

1117
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:33,240
so I am early uh we got time for

1118
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,980
questions

1119
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:37,560
um if there are no more questions then

1120
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,900
thank you but if there are questions I'd

1121
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,440
love to hear them

1122
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,300
got them all out

1123
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,140
we got one in the back

1124
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,119
can you say more about that

1125
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:57,560
okay can you say more about that

1126
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,420
so I don't know maybe we'll call maybe

1127
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:05,339
we're calling calls the same just

1128
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:06,599
different things what's when you say

1129
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:10,220
Change Control call what do you mean

1130
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:14,720
through the 10 best

1131
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:18,000
oh I see what you're saying okay yeah so

1132
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,640
we typically say let me that's more of

1133
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,599
like if we're not going to tell them

1134
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:22,859
that's more of like a red team type

1135
00:40:22,859 --> 00:40:25,260
thing and like we don't do

1136
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,940
the traditional red team because we

1137
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,020
don't really feel as though we have a

1138
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,040
lot of clients that are ready for that

1139
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,060
and we're not going to try to sell them

1140
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,980
something right so it's like we'll call

1141
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,780
it an advanced security assessment where

1142
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,579
it's like it's goal based but it's and

1143
00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:37,320
we're not going to tell very many people

1144
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,060
but you know it's not going to be like

1145
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,320
we're going to come in through the

1146
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,640
ceiling like Tom Cruise and Mission

1147
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,380
Impossible like it's not going to be

1148
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,720
that type of thing so what we'd like to

1149
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,579
tell them is they often ask like should

1150
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:49,260
we tell our

1151
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,780
uh mssp or whatever that you're going to

1152
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,400
be banging away I was like we typically

1153
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,480
say no because you kind of want to see

1154
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,880
what you're paying for right

1155
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,380
um but if they want to tell everybody

1156
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:01,380
whatever I mean it's not I think I think

1157
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,660
they ideally they listen to me because

1158
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,859
they're paying for our services and

1159
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:07,020
trust us but you never know does that

1160
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,160
answer the question

1161
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,140
sorry I never heard that terminology for

1162
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,660
that type of a meeting

1163
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:15,078
sure

1164
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:20,540
all right

1165
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,460
um

1166
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:36,180
yeah the bigger ones that definitely

1167
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,619
happens we had one

1168
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:39,359
we were doing I was doing a physical

1169
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:40,740
test

1170
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:43,500
in New York a few weeks ago and we had

1171
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,760
the scope call like there's all these

1172
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,339
stakeholders on it right and you have

1173
00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:49,079
that like internal politics that starts

1174
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:50,700
to Bubble Up like when there's as the

1175
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:51,900
organizations get bigger and bigger and

1176
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,760
bigger it's like well IA doesn't like so

1177
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,680
and so and infrastructure doesn't like

1178
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,660
security or like whatever it is and they

1179
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,040
don't necessarily talk internally about

1180
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,680
what's going to happen so my face ended

1181
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,960
up plastered like across every single

1182
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,700
bank branch for this like five billion

1183
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,560
dollar Bank in Albany

1184
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,900
and luckily like we had our like get out

1185
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,520
of jail free letters and like our

1186
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,380
contacts that were going to be available

1187
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:16,440
24 7. and they got called and it like it

1188
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,820
all like calmed down but like I

1189
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,859
literally saw my picture like up on like

1190
00:42:19,859 --> 00:42:23,220
they're they're like their security like

1191
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:25,560
like big ass like security screen thing

1192
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,900
yeah it was that was fun

1193
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,640
um sorry there was another question

1194
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:33,140
something was here maybe not

1195
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,800
sure

1196
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,579
part of it too

1197
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,359
right

1198
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,859
right

1199
00:42:58,079 --> 00:42:59,640
yeah and that's the other hard thing is

1200
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,319
like when we're having our scope calls

1201
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:03,119
like a week or two before the job starts

1202
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,160
and we we want whoever's going to be

1203
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,800
there like any any given stakeholder for

1204
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,700
whatever thing whatever we're going to

1205
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:09,420
touch

1206
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,160
where in sometimes sometimes we're

1207
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:14,339
relying on our initial pocs to pull the

1208
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:15,720
right people into that call because we

1209
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,099
might not know necessarily who they are

1210
00:43:17,099 --> 00:43:18,960
and if they don't and then they don't

1211
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,020
after the call like then tell them like

1212
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:23,760
that can be a problem and we can do only

1213
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,440
so much right like are there systems

1214
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,000
that you don't want us to touch because

1215
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,339
of time of day or because like you said

1216
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:30,900
their legacy or like whatever it is

1217
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,119
usually people are like hey no no big

1218
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:34,619
deal right but like sometimes they're

1219
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:36,420
like no I need you to not touch or

1220
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:38,040
whatever's over here on this like subnet

1221
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:41,640
right that's fine but we can we can ask

1222
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,079
those questions but we can't like go to

1223
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:44,579
each person's like front door and be

1224
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:46,260
like hey did you get the memo from like

1225
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:49,700
Matt like we're going to be doing this

1226
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,540
yeah

1227
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,819
right yeah no 100

1228
00:43:56,819 --> 00:43:59,240
good

1229
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,680
um

1230
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:12,859
yeah

1231
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,900
foreign

1232
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,599
but it doesn't seem

1233
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,599
s

1234
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,800
no I'm glad yeah did you come in in time

1235
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,660
for the question slide that you should

1236
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:11,839
ask

1237
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:15,078
this will be available

1238
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:16,560
there's I have a whole slide it's like

1239
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,240
things you should ask the vendor

1240
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,618
when you're oh okay good

1241
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:29,480
sure

1242
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:39,078
right

1243
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:52,140
Memphis

1244
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:55,800
wow

1245
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,319
right

1246
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:00,980
wow

1247
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,619
all right

1248
00:46:07,619 --> 00:46:10,500
right the verb collider the burp file is

1249
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,760
like the

1250
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,020
it's like the web app equivalent of

1251
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:16,220
getting slammed with a spreadsheet

1252
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,599
yep

1253
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:22,859
now

1254
00:46:22,859 --> 00:46:24,480
I mean I think honestly I could be wrong

1255
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,800
but I'm pretty sure the average hourly

1256
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,200
rate is like three to 350. right across

1257
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,420
like bigger companies like it's like 300

1258
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,040
350 bucks I think a lot of places are

1259
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,619
charging like per hour for a pen test I

1260
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:36,420
mean like some maybe a little more

1261
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:38,819
definitely some less but from what at

1262
00:46:38,819 --> 00:46:41,900
least what we've seen it's

1263
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
um

1264
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:47,280
right

1265
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,020
sure no

1266
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:50,579
there was another question over there I

1267
00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:52,760
think

1268
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:06,140
foreign

1269
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,760
right

1270
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,300
sure

1271
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,280
um

1272
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:07,940
right right

1273
00:48:08,579 --> 00:48:11,060
sure

1274
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:15,260
okay

1275
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:20,220
right

1276
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:21,660
it's funny you mentioned like the

1277
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:23,880
internal change control because

1278
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,920
that same client was whose picture I got

1279
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,599
plastered like all over their their sock

1280
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:28,859
or whatever

1281
00:48:28,859 --> 00:48:30,060
um

1282
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:33,000
we deployed a box like a Raspberry Pi to

1283
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,099
do a pen a soon breach pen test and a

1284
00:48:35,099 --> 00:48:37,319
nested scanner VM because that was a

1285
00:48:37,319 --> 00:48:38,880
separate part of another thing we were

1286
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,220
doing wasn't part of the pen test

1287
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:43,619
and their internal I was mentioning

1288
00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:45,060
their internal teams weren't super fond

1289
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:48,119
of each other it would seem right so I

1290
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:49,800
didn't realize it's good but they were

1291
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,060
like creating tickets for like this

1292
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:52,680
thing's reliable Network for x amount of

1293
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,660
time and then take an off rate but

1294
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:55,619
they're not telling each other because

1295
00:48:55,619 --> 00:48:57,060
like one was deploying the scanner one

1296
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:59,280
was deploying the Raspberry Pi and to

1297
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,319
get to the scanner we're using Raspberry

1298
00:49:01,319 --> 00:49:04,500
Pi and so they're killing one and then

1299
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,240
I'm like hey this is down wide like the

1300
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,500
ticket said it was only supposed to be

1301
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,480
online until the end of this week right

1302
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,099
and then they're like so we took it off

1303
00:49:11,099 --> 00:49:14,099
and there was no specific time listed on

1304
00:49:14,099 --> 00:49:15,960
the ticket so we did it at eight o'clock

1305
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,280
in the morning instead of five o'clock

1306
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,680
at night because it was a long weekend

1307
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,119
like it's good that they have the

1308
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:22,260
internal mechanisms they're not just

1309
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:23,700
like yeah sure we'll show this thing on

1310
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,260
the network and like forget about it

1311
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:28,819
right at least they're doing that it's
