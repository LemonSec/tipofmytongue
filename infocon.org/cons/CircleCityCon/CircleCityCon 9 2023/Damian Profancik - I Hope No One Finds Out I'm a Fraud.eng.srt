1
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,800
so I'm Damon profansick uh and

2
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,900
the talk I want to give today is about

3
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,199
Apostle syndrome which I think a lot of

4
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,759
us feel

5
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:33,360
um

6
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,059
and uh you know

7
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:38,280
we feel like maybe we aren't worthy of

8
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,899
of where we are in our career

9
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,760
so just a little bit about me uh

10
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,059

I've been performing offensive testing

15
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,860
for the last about 12 years

16
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:02,940

types of firms

22
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,939
lots of Fortune 100s and and alike I

23
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:23,880
lead our co-lead our local Oasis chapter

24
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,619
here in Indianapolis

and help coordinating Circle city con

26
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,220
here where I'm speaking today

27
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,159
um I've spoken at many large conferences

28
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,520
uh published tools and cves

29
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,579
my career

30
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:46,020
I don't say any of this to brag that's

31
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,659
not about that this is to set the stage

32
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,939
for what I'm about to talk about

33
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:53,040
today

34
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,360
so

35
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,040
we're here to talk about imposter

36
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,200
syndrome

37
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,619
which as I said a lot of people feel

38
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:03,840
especially through coming out of the

39
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,880
pandemic mental health is a very

40
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,439
important topic

41
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,979
in our industry also especially so

42
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,540
that's why I wanted to address this

43
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,160
today

44
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,480
so the Oxford dictionary defines

45
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,879
imposter uh or syndrome as the ability

46
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,640
inability or persistent inability to

47
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,280
believe that one's success is deserved

48
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,760
or has been legitimately achieved as a

49
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,399
result of One's Own efforts or skills

50
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,780
um unfortunately about 70 percent of

51
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,280
people and that's why I feel like it's a

52
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,800
relevant Topic in our industry and

53
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,099
frankly a lot of other Industries uh 70

54
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:48,440
of people

55
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,360
experience this imposter syndrome at

56
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,440
some point in their career

57
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,819
uh the irony also is that

58
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:02,879
um the more successful you get

59
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,519
you start to feel it more because you're

60
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,319
achieving more in your career

61
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:10,260
and you're just not confident in your in

62
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,720
what you've got going on

63
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,540
um and this especially strikes women

64
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,840
which is also very critical for our

65
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,620
industry is there we we're trying to

66
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,379
do more diversity and more inclusion and

67
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:29,459
and bring more women into our industry

68
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,580
now there's a number of reasons why uh

69
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,819
we experience this imposter syndrome

70
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:37,019
um so I'm going to try to break those

71
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:39,300
down a little bit

72
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,959
uh one is the perfectionist and I would

73
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,000
classify myself I fall into this

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,200
category

75
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,000
um

76
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,400
and uh some reasons why the

77
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,819
perfectionist struggles is

78
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:55,879
um

79
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:59,459
um just like analysis paralysis you you

80
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:01,500
feel like you can't if you can't get it

81
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,840
perfect you can't get it right you can't

82
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,480
do the job correctly

83
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,920
This was

84
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,280
um really particularly uh you know we're

85
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,159
in reflection uh in middle school I I

86
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,978
could jump really high and far I could

87
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:19,380
run really fast

88
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,199
and I wanted to go out for a track in

89
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,280
Middle School

90
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,500
but I chose not to because if I couldn't

91
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,660
be the best

92
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,400
I didn't want to do it at all

93
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,300
and I regret that to this day that I

94
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,180
could have done more there

95
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,699
um the other thing too is uh

96
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:40,979
I'm an artist

97
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:43,860
um and in high school

98
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,580
I was

99
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:50,040
Treasurer and then the next secretary of

100
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,500
National Art Honor Society I went

101
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,479
through

102
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:57,000
advanced placement art and uh you know

103
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,040
all basically I exhausted the art

104
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,960
classes

105
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,600
and uh

106
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,400
but

107
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,520
I was really hard on myself and since

108
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,020
high school

109
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,020
I think I've drawn three things

110
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,240
just because it does give me some

111
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,180
anxiety because I don't do rough drafts

112
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,020
I draw it and you know it is what it is

113
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,300
and so if it's not I'm also a super

114
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,220
realist so if it doesn't look exactly

115
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,100
like what I'm trying to replicate

116
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,560
I struggle with that

117
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,880
um

118
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,139
so

119
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:37,020
uh the next would be the Superwoman or

120
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,600
Superman uh

121
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,300
the ones having a hero complex they have

122
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,699
to save the day they have to say yes to

123
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:46,800
everything and they struggle with saying

124
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,960
no and then you get

125
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,180
uh overloaded

126
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,100
um oversubscribe

127
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,460
and uh I struggle with this a little bit

128
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,880
too feeling like I'll if I say no that's

129
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,180
just weakness I'm not I can't handle

130
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,940
everything and we and the truth be told

131
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,240
we can't handle everything so that's not

132
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,699
realistic and that's going to cause more

133
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:15,660
anxiety and more of that syndrome

134
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,720
uh the other one is the natural genius

135
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,840
these are people that do have an innate

136
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,660
skill that's already

137
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,840
in their DNA that they are just really

138
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,300
good at whatever it is

139
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,300
um and what they do is then rely on that

140
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,139
natural ability and uh

141
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:40,560
then what that leads to also is the lack

142
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,960
of preparation for what they're about to

143
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,940
do because they just rely that they are

144
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,740
really good at what they do

145
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,979
uh and that can cause them to fail

146
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:53,960
because they are not prepared

147
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,380
uh the next one would be The Soloist

148
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,620
so this is the Lone Wolf you know go on

149
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,940
their own

150
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,639
guns ablazon

151
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:08,160
um and early on my career

152
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,280
uh when I first started Consulting 21

153
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,479
years ago

154
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,419
this was this came up on my review

155
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:19,680
probably every year is like you you

156
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,900
don't you're not team player you're

157
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,020
trying to go It Alone you you're

158
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,360
um you know you need to work with others

159
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,680
and

160
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,139
and that came out of I think again back

161
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:33,360
to the perfectionists it came out of

162
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,280
if you want something done right you do

163
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,220
it yourself and I don't trust other

164
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,520
people or rely on other people also I

165
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,380
can do it

166
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,380
um and and that that just is going to

167
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,800
build anxiety and also lead to failure

168
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,120
you know eventually

169
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,400
um the other one is the expert the one

170
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,259
who has to be the smartest person in the

171
00:07:58,259 --> 00:07:59,460
room and they don't feel like they're

172
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,020
good enough if they can't Trump

173
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,479
everybody in the room

174
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:06,419
um and they have a strong fear of

175
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,860
looking dumb

176
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,919
uh and and that leads again back to

177
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:13,860
anxiety and um stress

178
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,440
and and then imposter syndrome that

179
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,479
maybe they're faking it maybe they

180
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,340
aren't the smartest person in the room

181
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,099
uh as I said before

182
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:30,060
um the irony of it is that uh the more

183
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,659
successful uh you are in your career the

184
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:36,360
more you may feel this way as we get as

185
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,479
we grow in our careers

186
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,380
again

187
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,380
one of these things too is like back to

188
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,740
the perfect perfectionist is uh you know

189
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,339
one of the issues is procrastination

190
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:53,360
um putting things off

191
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,700
out of fear that they won't have it

192
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,200
completely necessary to their high

193
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,399
standards or their boss's high standards

194
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:07,080
um and oftentimes it's also because or

195
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,779
if they do succeed they feel like it's a

196
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:13,200
fluke or it's luck uh that God with them

197
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,180
there

198
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,060
um the other flip side coin of that is

199
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,240
over preparation so this is like

200
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,320
um

201
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,920
uh not feeling like you you have

202
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,160
everything right exactly then you know

203
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,320
you're kind of just stuck in them up

204
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,279
um

205
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:36,240
uh this is really reinforces the idea

206
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,120
that the Imposter needs to work extra

207
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,200
hard

208
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,760
and would not have succeeded otherwise

209
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,899
um

210
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:48,300
and then once because they work so hard

211
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,640
often this leads to burnout

212
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,839
also a problem in our industry

213
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:56,820
um

214
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,399
I talked about the smartest person in

215
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,620
the room thing uh I didn't hold my hand

216
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,620
up for that one but I also I dealt dealt

217
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,580
with this in my early career as well

218
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,100
um my first job

219
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,140
I started Consulting right out of the

220
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,959
gate I I was never you know practitioner

221
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:19,380
the company that I was with we uh you

222
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,640
know we did a lot of things and I

223
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,420
learned

224
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,880
basically if it plugs in the wall or you

225
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,440
know have Blinky Lights I've done it

226
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,360
anything you can think of

227
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,519
um

228
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:32,459
and I ended up in my team being the one

229
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:34,260
that everyone came to

230
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,260
something was if they had a sticky

231
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,580
problem that they couldn't figure out

232
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,820
like they came to me and inevitably I

233
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,980
usually could fix it or figure out a way

234
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,140
to fix it

235
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,260
um and they started calling me Neo

236
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,920
around the office which inflates your

237
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,640
ego right you know and um

238
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,380
my boss

239
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:02,220
uh he got jealous and was like Hey

240
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,200
everybody stop calling him Neo you know

241
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,700
because

242
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,860
you have to not be afraid to not be the

243
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,839
smartest person

244
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,320
I've you know I've worked for

245
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,779
like I said numerous consulting firms

246
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:17,880
and as I Advanced my career and worked

247
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,000
for some really rock star companies like

248
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,519
NCC group and

249
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,399
um uh you know just all over my listed

250
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,880
uh I found like I'm not

251
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,000
and I may be a senior person to a person

252
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,040
and frankly

253
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,399
in that area smarter than I am we have

254
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,620
to not be afraid there's too many areas

255
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,839
for us to to be the expert in everything

256
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:46,459
here and be the smartest person

257
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,860
um

258
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:53,399
so but I mean the more we learn and know

259
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:57,240
the more we realize we don't know

260
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,519
and that's what growing in our career is

261
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,420
about and and trusting on other people

262
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,339
um and I that's why where I learned like

263
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:07,380
I don't know everything and I can't know

264
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,500
everything

265
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:12,140
um

266
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,000
the other thing that my lovely wife is

267
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,240
actually sitting it on it's here uh we

268
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,820
talk about a lot is that

269
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,220
um kids growing their brains back in

270
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,040
their 20s right uh and realizing that

271
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,200
they're their parents weren't the morons

272
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,000
they thought they were they don't know

273
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,279
everything so this is about growth and

274
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:34,860
about learning that we don't know

275
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,620
everything and there are other people

276
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:41,880
that you know know stuff and uh

277
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,860
and so this is their coming of age

278
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:48,420
failure

279
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,100
this goes back to all the things they

280
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,000
said people have a fear of failure

281
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,880
failure is necessary

282
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,700
failure is how we grow

283
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,019
here's a vast difference between

284
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:03,060
intelligence and wisdom

285
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:06,000
wisdom's gained by failing

286
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,480
and learning from that failure

287
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,100
um

288
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,880
and knowing we will fail

289
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,800
it's it's just like in our industry we

290
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,660
say no more uh if we'll be briefed it's

291
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:25,260
when will be breached we will fail

292
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,200
and that's okay but the most key part of

293
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,120
that is fail fast

294
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,180
fail fast realize it and learn from it

295
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,620
grow

296
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,839
so that you don't fail again in that

297
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:38,040
same manner

298
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,320
you may fail in another manner but in

299
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,480
that manner you won't fail

300
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,720
and so learn from those mistakes

301
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,720
um

302
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:53,240
one of the first podcasts when I got

303
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,740
really deep into information security I

304
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,380
listened to was was one that was a

305
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,040
recording of many you may know Adam

306
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,680
Savage from MythBusters

307
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:09,480
he gave a keynote speech at Defcon 17

308
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,040
um which was

309
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,139
just mind-blowing to me

310
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:15,540
and one of the key statements I took out

311
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,959
of that it was a story of how as he got

312
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,480
into the um

313
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,980
his industry of like movie

314
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,200
you know special effects and things like

315
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,880
that uh

316
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,480
uh how he failed uh so it was a whole

317
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,320
talk on failure was superb

318
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,600
he said some key things and one of the

319
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,579
key things he said is I don't trust

320
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:44,339
people who haven't failed

321
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:47,579
and that's for various reasons one he

322
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:50,220
said they're Liars

323
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,579
they everybody failed

324
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:57,180
uh number two would be they're gonna

325
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,339
throw you under the bus because they

326
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:02,519
don't want to look like they failed

327
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:04,800
and number three is

328
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,480
they just don't have enough experience

329
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,519
maybe they're new to the industry maybe

330
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:10,860
they're new to this area

331
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,600
um so

332
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,720
uh that's why he says I don't trust

333
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,860
people who haven't failed

334
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,740
so what now what I mean I've given a lot

335
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,720
of stuff about this but

336
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,019
how do we work past it how do we move on

337
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,940
uh the first thing is just start Where

338
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:33,720
You Are

339
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,720
you know we're at this place acknowledge

340
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,040
uh the way that you feel uh and it and

341
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,899
own it

342
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:45,120
um but know that you're not alone

343
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,180
as I said in the beginning 70 percent

344
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,180
uh of folks almost three quarters of

345
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,519
folks are going to experience this at

346
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,139
some point in their career

347
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:58,220
so you're not alone

348
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,560
you don't need to be perfect

349
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,880
you don't

350
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,399
again you're going to fail

351
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:08,360
you have to acknowledge that

352
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,399
Perfection is frankly it's as impossible

353
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:14,760
it's impossible ask the possible task

354
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,380
um but

355
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,660
if you're not perfect and you do fail

356
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,360
like I said before learn from those

357
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,899
mistakes so that you can improve and be

358
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:27,180
better next time

359
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,279
also

360
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,899
um part of like especially the

361
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:32,639
perfectionists

362
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:38,000
and things fear feedback and criticism

363
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:40,199
ask

364
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,720
for constructive criticism

365
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,880
ask for it to come back so that you can

366
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,100
get better at what you do what you do

367
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,199
and

368
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,180
um and Excel and that will help lower

369
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,519
the anxiety and lower that feeling of

370
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,880
impossible

371
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,180
my first consulting job

372
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,680
I had uh

373
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,199
I had an incident with with a CEO that

374
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,000
uh

375
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,280
they weren't doing things the way that I

376
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,500
felt they should be doing right

377
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,020
um and so I talked to the CEO

378
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,520
is like

379
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,859
blah blah blah you know we're not doing

380
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:20,880
this thing

381
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,040
right and he's like

382
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,799
well you know I disagree I'm like well

383
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:27,540
no

384
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,059
I was seeing cocky arrogant early in my

385
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:31,500
career

386
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,919
um and defensive

387
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:35,940
um

388
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:39,380
hey I was Neo right

389
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:41,640
well I got back to the office

390
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,340
I got called in by my boss

391
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:47,039
I was like hey did you argue with the

392
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,160
CEO of one of our clients

393
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,679
I was like no I didn't argue I just told

394
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:55,799
him how it is

395
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:59,220
and he told me something that I remember

396
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,220
to this day uh and and take heart and

397
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,580
especially in Consulting

398
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:07,679
perception is reality

399
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,380
if he felt you were arguing with him

400
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,539
you were arguing with him it doesn't

401
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:15,720
matter what you think or feel so

402
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,179
just keep in mind that people are going

403
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:21,000
to perceive things their own way

404
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,679
and uh you know move past it

405
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,799
um Socrates gave a great quote quote um

406
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,320
I want to read is uh true knowledge

407
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,940
exists in knowing that you know nothing

408
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:39,179
we don't know everything and and we

409
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:42,179
would never will and so you just have to

410
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:45,419
accept Where You Are

411
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:46,679
um

412
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:49,500
another great quote by Neil deGrasse

413
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,660
Tyson is um

414
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,120
one of the great challenges in life is

415
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,200
knowing

416
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,700
enough

417
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,260
to think

418
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:02,820
you're right but not knowing enough

419
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,720
that you're wrong

420
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,860
and you know this is where the kids grow

421
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:12,500
their brains back later check that out

422
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,740
also stick to the fact

423
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,440
you know understand

424
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,780
Where You Are

425
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,520
um

426
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,039
take maybe take some time to reflect on

427
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,380
your prior achievement

428
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,900
don't forget where you came from

429
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,780
you have built a great career you have

430
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,820
done great things

431
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,919
so don't be too hard on yourself

432
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,020
think about that

433
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,360
also something that I learned in my

434
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,919
first Consulting career especially this

435
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,919
especially great for uh like when you

436
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:50,299
have your annual review or whatever

437
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:54,539
um if you get emails or accolades

438
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:55,919
say those

439
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,260
document those

440
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,480
um it's really good for reflection but

441
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,460
also like I said great for job reviews

442
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,160
to be able to send to your awesome

443
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,620
uh and to be able to talk back because

444
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,660
you I mean you don't really remember

445
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,220
everything that might

446
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,960
or all the Praises that you may have

447
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,840
gotten and sometimes

448
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,539
in our industry there isn't a lot of

449
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:19,620
praise

450
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,020
thankless job but when you get those

451
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,860
save them for your own edification but

452
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:30,979
also for like I said job reviews

453
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,100
also don't go It Alone you know um I

454
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,320
mentioned 70 percent

455
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,000
there are other ones out there

456
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,320
struggling

457
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,940
so

458
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,299
realize when you need help early and you

459
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:47,400
might be struggling

460
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,100
don't be embarrassed to ask for help I

461
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,960
know that's a challenging thing

462
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,799
especially in our industry is that we

463
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:56,460
um

464
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:00,179
there's there can be an ego problem

465
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:02,820
um and so but don't be embarrassed to

466
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,320
ask for help especially if you have a

467
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,380
safe group to ask for help uh whether

468
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,120
it's within your company whether it's

469
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,460
within this community

470
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:16,860
uh ask for help set your ego aside

471
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,059
um because

472
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:21,419
medley we're all still learning and and

473
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:24,679
we have to understand that

474
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,360
additionally recognize others

475
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,400
achievements

476
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,480
um

477
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,120
you like as I said you can't know

478
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,559
everything

479
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,260
especially in an expansive and

480
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,720
ever-changing field as ours where one

481
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,400
day it's one thing and then a whole

482
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,340
another day it's something else

483
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,100
we're constantly learning

484
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,620
and recognize that

485
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,559
um don't compare apples to oranges uh

486
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,600
just because someone's really good at

487
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,880
like mobile pen testing which you're

488
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,539
really good at web app testing

489
00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:02,700
you you can't you'd be down on yourself

490
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,059
like oh I don't know everything I

491
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:08,400
you know understand is apples and

492
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,620
oranges we all have different strengths

493
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,539
and weaknesses

494
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,280
um

495
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,260
so don't be threatened by them

496
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:19,919
uh embrace them use leverage them use

497
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,039
them for mentorship for your own growth

498
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,200
in learning

499
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,340
um

500
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,500
also things may not always be what they

501
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,700
think it may be you know uh one way on

502
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,520
the outside you know an example of this

503
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,559
is like social media people want

504
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:39,900
people's other families on social media

505
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,640
oh they're always on vacation they're

506
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,260
always having the perfect life the

507
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,059
perfect kids

508
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:47,100
it's not always the case

509
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,720
and so

510
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,240
keep that in mind too that maybe

511
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,280
everyone else doesn't have it put

512
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,940
together and you are not put together so

513
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,039
rely on that

514
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:03,000
also as I talked about feedback before

515
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
you provide valuable feedback

516
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,820
it's a valuable constructive feedback

517
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,580
not just criticism but something that

518
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,400
that they could use take away and learn

519
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,039
from it and then

520
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,220
um you know become a stronger consultant

521
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,860
or practitioner or whatever it may be

522
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,500
this applies to all of our life it

523
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,580
doesn't have to just be security

524
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,740
industry

525
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,940
um

526
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:33,000
also something that as I became a people

527
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,600
manager and even probably before

528
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,260
um

529
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,900
praise them personally

530
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,159
um lift them up

531
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:45,360
but also what I try to do is uh you know

532
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,059
if if I hear something good or I see

533
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:51,659
something good that uh some individual

534
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:53,640
is doing well

535
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,940
I'll send the email to them usually

536
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:00,480
seeing their managers so that they get

537
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,000
the recognition that again in the

538
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,640
thankless career we sometimes do

539
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,860
won't get and we'll help them on their

540
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,240
job reviews

541
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:13,080
uh and and with that be specific on what

542
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,399
they did very well

543
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,460
uh decide to thrive so don't get stuck

544
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,620
in the mud you know just

545
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,659
that's the whole point of this is move

546
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:27,240
on from it it's a state of mind

547
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:32,400
uh often as we uh tell kit our kids

548
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,080
um we can't control all the

549
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,799
circumstances but we can control

550
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:40,559
how we react to those circumstances

551
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,559
so it's not always going to go your way

552
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,299
and that may be not your fault and maybe

553
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:47,280
Alexander your control but

554
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,460
uh you decide how you want to

555
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,020
internalize that and how you want to

556
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,159
handle that

557
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:57,480
you decide uh how we respond

558
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,700
and believe in yourself

559
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,419
I mean you made it to where you are

560
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:07,200
for various reasons believe in yourself

561
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,780
so get give yourself your own little pep

562
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:12,020
talk

563
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:13,740
um

564
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,240
lastly

565
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,520
connect with other imposters

566
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,120
I use air quotes around that imposters

567
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,020
because as I said again 70 feel the same

568
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,659
way you do and so don't be afraid to

569
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:28,740
reach out

570
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,500
seek out others who have the same way of

571
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,760
feeling

572
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,659
and don't feel ashamed because you're in

573
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:41,220
a big crowd of people that feel likely

574
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,220
the same way you do at at least at some

575
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,220
point and they can remember and relate

576
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:51,419
so reach out if you have any of these

577
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:54,860
concerns or feelings

578
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,720
with that I'll take questions

579
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,860
comments

580
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:07,400
okay

581
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,779
that is it

582
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:12,679
ah okay

583
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,039
well

584
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,140
so the question was how do you provide

585
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,580
that constructive feedback to someone

586
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:30,600
without them feeling offended

587
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:34,380
there's a there's multi parts of that

588
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:39,480
um one is as I mentioned before uh

589
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,400
part of that's on them if they feel that

590
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,659
way

591
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:43,380
um

592
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,779
but

593
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:48,059
so you can't be afraid to provide that

594
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:50,039
constructive feedback

595
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:52,380
um and not everyone is going to take it

596
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,820
well

597
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,620
the first time

598
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,600
or the second time where they're done or

599
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,520
whatever

600
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,620
but they may reflect on it maybe years

601
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,020
later and

602
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:07,740
be like man she's right you know

603
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,140
I am seeing a pattern I I do need to

604
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,580
change this

605
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,240
um

606
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,700
so don't be afraid to do that because

607
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,100
you may offend someone

608
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,140
um and that's why I also add that

609
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:22,620
clarifier valuable or constructive

610
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,840
if you're just scraping and someone just

611
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,779
right with them it's not it's not

612
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:29,880
constructive

613
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,120
also come with a recommendation

614
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,740
um

615
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:38,159
uh people who worked for me uh you know

616
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,320
I could tell them don't come to me with

617
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,380
a problem just with just the problem

618
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,320
come to me with one maybe two maybe

619
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,220
three solutions that you recommend

620
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,039
um so if you're giving constructive

621
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,480
criticism

622
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,480
don't just criticize

623
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,640
uh maybe give them some helpful

624
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,279
recommendations that they could do to

625
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:04,620
modify that behavior or whatever it is

626
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,840
and

627
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,059
in the future

628
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:11,400
um one of the

629
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,500
one of the interview questions I love to

630
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,799
ask uh when I'm interviewing people is

631
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,740
tell me about a project or time or

632
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,799
something that horribly wrong

633
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,039
and what did you learn from it how did

634
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:28,559
you handle it how did you if it was a

635
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,020
client facing thing how did you you know

636
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:34,620
a sway their concerns

637
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,740
and that is for a very good reason that

638
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,740
I asked that tricky question because

639
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:42,720
that goes back to the Adam Savage quote

640
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,940
I don't trust people who haven't failed

641
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,520
uh if they tell them can't name and not

642
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,620
a time and I tell them it doesn't have

643
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,179
to be in your work career it doesn't

644
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:52,140
have to be

645
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,360
Purity related

646
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,520
you tell me about time because I want

647
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,900
them to be honest I want to see their

648
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,419
honesty and I want to gauge where they

649
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:03,779
are on that list of of concerns that

650
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:06,059
Adam Savage had

651
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:06,960
um

652
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,480
so and I want to see that they had

653
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,400
growth that they learned something from

654
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,600
it and

655
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,340
I'm not going to repeat that task in the

656
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,179
future

657
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:18,720
so that's why I asked that question

658
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,220
does that answer your question

659
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:27,260
okay uh anything else yeah

660
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,179
oh that's a very good question the

661
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:39,179
question was any tips on recognize when

662
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:41,520
others might be having imposter syndrome

663
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,520
and helping them through it

664
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,520
um

665
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:51,080
I I would reflect back to

666
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,740
uh probably the slide

667
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,740
is is recognizing that the ways that

668
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,679
people might

669
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,059
pigeonhole themselves into this right

670
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:09,679
look for the lone wolf look for the

671
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,880
perfectionists who you know it's not

672
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,080
getting things done because they can't

673
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,000
get it perfect

674
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,140
um

675
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,720
just you know look through this list see

676
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,700
look for the person who you you ask

677
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:24,240
stuff for and then just never say no

678
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,000
um and I think that would be a good way

679
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,480
to identify those and and maybe uh

680
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,100
gently

681
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:36,000
suggest some things that might help from

682
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,820
the list that I gave later on how to how

683
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,500
to make it better

684
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,899
like you might even seek those those

685
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:48,239
persons not people out and say uh

686
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:51,080
you reach out to them and say hey I'm

687
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,820
from I'm suffering from this you know

688
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:56,039
you make yourself vulnerable and then

689
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:58,980
reciproc reciprocity they might then

690
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,620
come back and and relate to a time that

691
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:04,399
they fell down to

692
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,919
anything else

693
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,020
okay

694
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:16,039
well thank you very much
