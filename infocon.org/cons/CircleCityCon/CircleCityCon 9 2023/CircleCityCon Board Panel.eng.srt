right so 2014. so let's tell the story

29
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,100
of how Circle city con uh began

30
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,840
um so it's going to start with me here

31
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,880
uh there was several people that were

32
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,920
planning a con

33
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,520

papers

37
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,479
and then started noticing how bad things

38
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,979
were

39
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,899
um the person who was originally

40
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:55,020
planning some for some God unknown

41
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,439
reason went to the hide and said hey

45
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,880
amount of food and beverage all this

46
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,258

57
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,860
gradually went on I started taking on

58
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,440
more and more of a leadership role here

59
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,940
um as we were trying to get

60
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,760

at that point I needed some help and so

63
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,480

65
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,879

70
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,500
I've been around the con scene but I

71
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,180
never wanted to be involved

72
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,400

76
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,099
on over a series of a couple of months I

77
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,260

84
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,659
this off and it turns out that he who

85

shall not be named don't mention this

86
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,200
kid's name in my presence because it

87
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,879
turns me into a different person because

88
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:45,120
of the experience here but

89
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,180
he had he had totally Fallen apart we'd

90
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,739
over committed for the first year who's

91
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:51,180
going to compete with some with a

92
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,400
conference like Derby con at the Titan I

93
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,540
mean this was kind of at their height

94
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,220
right they were a few years before us

95
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,440
and and you're going to come out of the

96
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,440
gate as a totally unknown in a I mean

97
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,540
there's a bit of a community here an

98
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,700
infosec Community here in the area but

99
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,159
not a con most of the Indie folks are

100
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,739
like traveling out of state for a

101
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:13,500
majority of the the larger uh and none

102
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,420
of these people believed in social media

103
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,880
at all so nobody's shocking so nobody's

104
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,519
gonna help and okay finally I all right

105
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,180
I'll I'll help you yes whatever you need

106
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,180
we'll make it happen and slowly slowly

107
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,040
pulled together Year One

108
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,240
yep so grape was my um made the trains

109
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,280
run on time so I I had the planning and

110
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,660
stuff and making the trains run on time

111
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,199
is not a a strong point of mind at all

112
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:43,199
ever however I had this guy here who is

113
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,060
hyper organized and does make the trains

114
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,759
run on time and so he was doing that for

115
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,979
me uh in Year One

116
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:53,220
we um we got closer and closer to the

117
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,280
con and I by he who must not be named I

118
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,900
like that we'll we'll use the Voldemort

119
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,520
title with him

120
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,440
um we got closer and closer I think

121
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,780
about a couple weeks out now during all

122
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,000
this time I had some volunteers that

123
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,699
popped up and I had this really really

124
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:12,259
young kid I mean this kid was so green

125
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:14,759
was so young went behind the ears is

126
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,380
that the term yeah went behind the ears

127
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,180
just like like just so so so so so young

128
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,699
and I can't stress how young he was but

129
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:27,120
he was a help and every time I needed

130
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,759
something he helped me with it

131
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,820
and so that was this man sitting to my

132
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,500
left I mean if I'm not mistaken we're

133
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,600
talking down to year one y'all were like

134
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,600
running ethernet cable through the we'll

135
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,380
get this back the cabling

136
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,479
um so yeah something's a little bit I

137
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,520
too had just been to Derby con I think

138
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,820
my first that was Defcon 20 I think or

139
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,979
no 21 it was Defcon 21. so I've been to

140
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:57,539
Defcon 21. that was derbycon 3 I think

141
00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:00,120
um and so yeah so I had also just come

142
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,160
from that I was like we don't have a con

143
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,620
in Indianapolis and I was like maybe I

144
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,960
could start a b-sides then I found out

145
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,940
Circle City because b-sides had already

146
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:14,100
been tried in Indiana twice prior to the

147
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,259
circle city con but they always got

148
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:19,020
canceled for some reason and the I think

149
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,699
it was the third time the second or

150
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:23,400
third time the main organizer had passed

151
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,539
away

152
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:27,180
oh that's right yeah and so that haven't

153
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,340
happened and then I heard Circle city

154
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,039
con was coming I'm like all right I want

155
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:33,660
to be a part of it I want to make sure

156
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,979
it's going to happen

157
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:36,660
you know I don't want to disappoint

158
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,280
people I want to have something here

159
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,680
that we can also get a taste of that

160
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,240
hacker community and build that

161
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,539
Community here let's do that uh and so I

162
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,580
got in contact with someone I think it

163
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,280
was Frank the Tank at the time uh was uh

164
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,020
was basically kind of running networks

165
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,660
and everything essentially kind of uh

166
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,880
kind of uh wanted to say mentored me

167
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,039
into that uh I got some Hardware

168
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,680
together put PF Sense on a box and

169
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,660
basically ran a knockoff that borrowed

170
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,580
some uh borrowed some Network gear from

171
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,380
Ivy Tech at the time thank you Ivy Tech

172

back where I worked then uh some old

173
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,220
mirror access points they used to have

174
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,380
so I gathered those and we had Wi-Fi and

175
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,180
we had internet we had Comcast come in

176

206
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,880
started giving me more and more stuff it

207
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,679
was fantastic so I was ordering all the

208
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,059
things getting all those things put

209
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:41,099
together it was awesome I actually did

210
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:42,779
love it it's back in the day now I have

211
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:45,420
way too much to do but anyway suffice to

212
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,519
say I was able to do it young very happy

213
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,620
to do everything I could

214
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,360
um and then yeah and it was kind of

215
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,820
getting the con to happen buying stuff

216
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,040
bringing it all in and I think that's

217
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,420
kind of where the next part of the story

218
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,240
is bringing the con together

219
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,399
I I can be persuasive when I want to be

220
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:06,899
um so

221
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:09,480
as we're getting closer and closer I I

222
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,220
remember this I think it was about two

223
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,220
weeks we'd just done a big group meeting

224
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,540
and I'm sitting there thinking oh

225
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,480
everything is good you know now I didn't

226
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,820
have access to the money at this point

227
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,279
money's never been my strongest point so

228
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,440
I have always I I've always pushed that

229
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,360
off it's just you know I'm not the

230
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,040
numbers guy I want to be the planning

231
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,160
guy that's what I want to do

232
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,500
so I I get a hold of uh he who must

233
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,200
might be named and then find out the

234
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,660
real situation that we're in

235
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:43,800
which is that we have maybe 15 grand in

236
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,300
the bank

237
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,940
we owe we have to do a deposit to the

238
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:52,980
hotel of what was it 25 000 I think

239
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,740
um and like going oh I don't have a

240
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,320
credit card with that limit on it

241
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,080
and sitting there going oh okay we're

242
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,560
we're and so sitting there and

243
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,600
talking and I I'd get a hold of I get a

244
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,640
hold of grape and talking to him

245
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,220
and finally I just about the bike called

246
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,980
Steve too Steve was uh Steve was a um

247
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,839
Steve got involved because he's from

248
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,760
Indy but at the time he worked for uh

249
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,519
CIO magazine so I always asked him uh

250
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,080
press advice we actually had an issue

251
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,940
with a trainer on that um that first

252
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,620
year and we uh he helped me deal with

253
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,959
that uh as well

254
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:30,180
um before the before the conference so I

255
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,220
called him get his advice I called grape

256
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,620
got his advice and finally I just I I

257
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,600
called to the hotel and just like hey

258
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,160
here's the situation

259
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,080
you know bit off more than he can

260
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,480
chew we're in trouble this is what we

261
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,839
can do and so the height was very cool

262
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,779
about it they um they took the 15 that

263
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:51,420
we had as a deposit

264
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,600
um and um they said okay we're gonna put

265
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,880
your rooms out there for for rent

266
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,380
whatever or for um uh to to pick up yeah

267
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,899
and you don't know about

268
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:07,019
how the rooms work how yeah okay how the

269
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:09,180
room block works is you get a room block

270
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,160
of so many rooms you have to sell up to

271
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,839
a certain amount there's an attrition

272
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,160
rate

273
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,720
um if you don't sell that well that was

274
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,940
your room obligation right

275
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:21,600
this was also Pride weekends

276
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,420
and Indie Pride is pretty big like about

277
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,519
tens of thousands of people come to Indy

278
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,640
Pride so that helped we ended up selling

279
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,100
out of those rooms anyway yep so we uh

280
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,480
we actually put some notices on there

281
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,459
that we were we had openings in the

282
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:37,620
rooms and that on some boards and stuff

283
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,260
with Indy pride and that snapped a bunch

284
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,320
up we went from owing you know that 20

285
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,920
25 Grand in rooms to uh only owing about

286
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,560
four grand to it for to the hotel so

287
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,779
really worked out well for us um they

288
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:53,519
waived a lot of the the requirements

289
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,779
that they originally had so they really

290
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:58,140
helped us this started though a trend of

291
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,540
things that was uh really not good in

292
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,399
the first year and really kind of raised

293
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,680
some of our stress levels up

294
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,600
so we get to the day of the hotel

295
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,339
another thing that we find out from the

296
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:10,740
hotel is we do not have the ability to

297
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,959
utilize their Network closet they told

298
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,180
us originally we could then they said we

299
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,579
couldn't to hook up our internet so

300
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:19,800
we did not have the great people of Ori

301
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,860
Nets who have brought us Wi-Fi and

302
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,600
internet and

303
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,700
um everything for the last eight years

304
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,220
who are an awesome awesome sponsor we

305
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,839
love you very much if anyone out there

306
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:33,420
is from there just FYI

307
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,899
um instead we had to get creative and so

308
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:38,519
I'll hand it to odd job to tell you how

309
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,860
he got creative in the numbers that came

310
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,300
up in that

311
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,700
so it wasn't actually too terribly bad

312
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,260
um apparently I think it was either

313
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,420
Comcast but I really want to say it was

314
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,279
Bright House So Bright House Networks

315
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,920
bought by Spectrum at some point

316
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,980
um so bright house ended up uh having

317
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,079
already connections into the hotel so I

318
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,959
contacted them and said oh cool yeah we

319
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,660
could run you two lines right into that

320
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,339
we had some kind of little staging

321
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:06,899
closet that was where the knock was

322
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:09,959
among other things I mean it's maybe

323
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:12,420
about as big as actually the stage the

324
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,760
room was it was a closet

325
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,639
um and so we did that and so they they

326
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:20,940
worked with the hotel they dropped two

327
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,480
cables down for us coax and then they

328
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,160
had modems on the end of them that we

329
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,160
popped in and then uh that was our

330
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,500
internet and I so on one side I popped

331
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,860
in the maroon or the the the firewall uh

332
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,660
the PS sense that was on a desktop

333
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,360
computer uh that was powering the

334
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,160
internet that day

335
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,440
um and then we also did uh we had

336
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,760
another one so that we could video

337
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,100
upload real quick so

338
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,779
um that was that was a separate line

339
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:51,000
just for that but uh otherwise yeah

340
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,839
that's how we did what oh so that so

341
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:57,899
that was the easy part Wireless that's

342
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:00,060
easy plugging that in that's easy

343
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:03,899
well we also then had to do uh was so

344
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:05,940
the way the way the Hyatt is set up is

345
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,920
you've got State you've got your talk

346
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,440
tracks over here and then there's this

347
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,399
big maw of a Atrium and there's this

348
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,980
little walkway over here and then

349
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,660
there's training rooms and other like

350
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,880
breakout rooms well we had trainings

351
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,040
over there and they needed Network and

352
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,839
we weren't allowed to use the patches

353
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:26,940
and the walls

354
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,800
but we did have two thousand feet of

355
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,839
cable in a box

356
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:34,800
so the cable makings party started the

357
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,139
first year of the con

358
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:39,660
cept oh it was used six hours making

359
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,040
cables so then finally we got enough

360
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,360
people who knew how to make cables they

361
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,279
made cables cable ends and everything

362
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:46,800
and then it was just me pulling cable

363
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,380
fitting it up against the walls making

364
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,300
sure that got done and then it was

365
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,220
getting Gaffers tape going into the

366
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,660
corners making sure that everything was

367
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,220
in the crevices of the wall so no one

368
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,579
would trip

369
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,380
yeah it was like eight or ten rolls of

370
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,060
Gaffers tape we bought a bunch for it

371
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,440
because we knew we'd need it and it was

372
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,260
just all that and and uh loads of people

373
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,540
stepped in like Steve D3 was in with me

374
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,519
just like helping out and I forget all

375
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,660
the other people who were there to help

376
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,740
but everyone's like what do you need

377
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,360
it's like oh we're loading a cable over

378
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,139
here

379
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:17,339
he's not I don't think he's in here Wick

380
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:18,899
was another one that was in there yeah

381
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:20,100
the the person that was doing some

382
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,079
photography there Wick also helped out

383
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,940
in and did that we just needed like a

384
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,500
couple cables just to the other side

385
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,240
because then we had a switch over there

386
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,820
for the training rooms uh some of these

387
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,800
people some of these people were not

388
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,920
actually volunteers or staff they were

389
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,560
just attendees like WIC uh as actually

390
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,380
was just an attendee and he hopped in

391
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,180
and started helping everything he could

392
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,519
which is why he's now a staffer so

393
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:46,199
actually this is also the time I was

394
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:48,000
actually coaching a cyber Patriot team

395
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,339
back at the time and I brought the team

396
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:53,639
with me to the conference and so I had

397
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:55,740
half a dozen high school kids and I was

398
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,420
just like here you got a badge you guys

399
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,980
get to come to the conference we need

400
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,320
help go to work and so I just kind of

401
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,120
almost like daycare I dropped them off

402
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,399
at the network closet to let OJ put them

403
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:07,740
to work and they had a great time with

404
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,880
it I think I taught them how to

405
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,740
terminate tables they terminated the

406
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,120
cables for us and one of them learned

407
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,860
how to how to work the PF sense I mean

408
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,540
these kids still talk about it today so

409
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,719
that's

410
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,699
so

411
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:25,620
so yeah so you're starting to see again

412
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,500
we're starting to see Trends there so

413
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,600
certain things happen during that such

414
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,380
as

415
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,720
um oh all of us working and certain

416
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,519
people deciding to go down to the bar

417
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,980
and sit there to the point where I come

418
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,740
down there and I'm like get up get up

419
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,699
there now or I'm gonna lose my and

420
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:46,019
actually I think there's a little more

421
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:47,759
screaming at that point yeah it was a

422
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,560
little more screamy on that point

423
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,620
yeah so they got up there there were a

424
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,180
few times that we had to go and say

425
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,079
something

426
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:56,940
um I think you had a couple of those too

427
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,380
right where you basically like get your

428
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,540
ass in here a few but I don't usually

429
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,839
have to repeat myself when that happens

430
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,020
it was um yeah it was fun so we got

431
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,939
through the first year I mean we had

432
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:11,040
maybe what 150 people

433
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,299
probably

434
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:14,280
yeah about 150 people including staff

435
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,319
speakers one wasn't heavily attended

436
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,880
again it was Father's Day weekend there

437
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,380
there's a shock that it wasn't heavily

438
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,760
attended

439
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,380
um there there was a reason we jumped at

440
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,880
the opportunity to move it to September

441
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,619
when they told us that uh they couldn't

442
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:27,839
do the July 4th day that was uh oh

443
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,640
really we can do that and you're going

444
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,120
to pay us Carl let's go do that yes uh

445
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,280
it was pretty easy decision by all of us

446
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,480
on that front

447
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,640
so you know we get through the end of

448
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,740
the first year and things have gone

449
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,380
mostly well and so at this point I had I

450
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,660
was pretty much running the con and uh

451
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:49,440
Voldemort that will again have in there

452
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,539
um kind of start disappearing throughout

453
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:53,940
the con yeah including on the last day

454
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,740
where we're in the middle of opening

455
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,419
ceremonies like hey hey where is he

456
00:17:57,419 --> 00:17:59,820
where where where is he he's going to be

457
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,220
on stage okay

458
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:04,260
and no one can find them kind of like

459
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,299
Steve right now that's gonna say a word

460
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:08,220
yeah kind of like Steve right now

461
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,620
um perfect and finally about halfway

462
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,299
through openings or uh closing

463
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,039
ceremonies he shows up in the back of

464
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:16,080
the room completely he was there a bit

465
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,320
actually

466
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:25,760
oh because he shaved his beard

467
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,340
so we didn't know who that was

468
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,220
back so Incognito from your own con yeah

469
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,980
I love it so that was starting to as you

470
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,000
might have guessed that started to

471
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,140
alienate

472
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,900
um alienate people that worked here uh

473
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,880
are we're working at the con uh

474
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,559
something if you ever do decide to run

475
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,080
your own con don't alienate the people

476
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,740
that volunteer for you because they are

477
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:58,160
volunteers are any of you being paid no

478
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,559
so it's way easy to alienate people it's

479
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:03,780
way easy to lose the valuable people

480
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,299
that you need uh we got down to set up

481
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:07,500
and I think this was kind of the straw

482
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,960
that dropped that broke the camel's back

483
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,460
um I don't know if it was for you but I

484
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,840
always I always Vision this is the time

485
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,240
as when you were finally like you were

486
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,919
just done

487
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:18,960
um and we're all cleaning up we're

488
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,820
trying to get everything loaded up to uh

489
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,740
get back in the rental vans because we

490
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,080
had to get them back by a certain time

491
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,520
um we're getting stuff back to uh the

492
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,260
hacker what was the hacker space name

493
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,059
I can't remember there was a hacker

494
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:32,460
space that lent us these speakers that

495
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,700
were God they were as tall as you

496
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,260
yeah they were six foot speakers these

497
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,120
were massive we actually got told to

498
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,440
turn them down multiple times with the

499
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,960
hotel because the uh top floor was um

500
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,240
was hearing all the music

501
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,919
um and we're trying to see that and um

502
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:49,799
well there were a few people including

503
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:52,320
um he who must not be named uh standing

504
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,539
around not doing anything and that's

505
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:56,460
where I saw you lose your you did

506
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,140
lose your at that point and that to

507
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,760
me was your that to me I still think was

508
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,559
your Breaking Point yeah I mean at that

509
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:03,240
point I mean this is this it was this it

510
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,900
was his idea this person

511
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,179
burst the idea that is the conference

512
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:10,919
that I think we've all come to know and

513
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:13,860
love at this point and I was just beside

514
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,380
myself like from the jump

515
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,480
you've made nothing but mistakes and now

516
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,980
you've got folks around you that are

517
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,299
trying to

518
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:24,000
pull it out of our ass so to speak and

519
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,880
you aren't showing any investment at all

520
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,620
why what are we doing

521
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,500
um so at this point I have

522
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,080
great I come up and I I call grape up

523
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,799
and I'm like hey next year and he's like

524
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,559
uh-uh you pick me or you pick him one of

525
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,500
us ain't gonna be here and then I had

526
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,299
several other people come up to me and

527
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:49,380
say the same thing and I'm going

528
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,200
all right Yep this is going to be it so

529
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,299
again lesson number two

530
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:56,940
one person should never be bigger than

531
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,039
the conference

532
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,900
may have seen an example of that this

533
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,179
year again I said we may have seen an

534
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,440
example of that this year again with a

535
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,080
different conference oh yeah

536
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,960
but one if a conference can't survive

537
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,140
without one person here that's you're

538
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,940
 and you're not doing it right and

539
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,880
Point Blank you're not doing it right

540
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,340
so I I fired

541
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,140
um he must write the Game kicked him out

542
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,220
of his own conference said hey look

543
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,780
we're we're going to keep going on with

544
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,360
this you can't be look at me I'm the

545
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,480
captain now

546
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,520
pretty much uh and and you know he was

547
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,500
he was he was upset of course but you

548
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,880
know it had to be done there was only

549
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,140
way the only way to make sure that that

550
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,820
conference kept going forward

551
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,799
so from there I started uh assembling

552
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,020
the leadership team obviously grape was

553
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,480
uh was going to be a key part of that uh

554
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,120
we brought on um Steve you know Steve D3

555
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,419
and then I brought on um Anja oh we

556
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:53,039
should tell the odd job story oh sure

557
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,659
sure so uh I

558
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:56,280
dream actually for me we were all

559
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,740
meeting at a restaurant right before

560
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,679
um the first day of the con and we're

561
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:02,940
sitting the restaurant he walks in he's

562
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,679
wearing this bowler hat looks like a

563
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:07,020
James Bond villain so I called him odd

564
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,640
job and that's where the name came from

565
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,919
so that's how he got his uh his hacker

566
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:13,679
name so from there we decided to uh we

567
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,140
structured we restructured we um

568
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,059
we unfortunately had a business partner

569
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:19,799
that I don't really want to go into them

570
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:23,340
much but all that's resolved now um so

571
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,679
there was some other drama that was not

572
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,299
our causing behind the stage from some

573
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:32,360
people uh but again they have trademarks

574
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,080
who was not a part of the continent Al

575
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,080
correct but anyways

576
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,659
so and that's where we got there so I

577
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:41,820
will say this from day or from the first

578
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,559
second year that we're there

579
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:47,520
I started tapping who I wanted to take

580
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,919
over for me I needed a what if I get hit

581
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,360
by a bus and so OJ has always been my

582
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,820
choice to be the person to take over for

583
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,860
me when I was done working on the

584
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,559
conference a couple years later grape

585
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:04,260
found his person and she's not in here

586
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:07,200
but I love you Alyssa yeah when DNS

587
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,679
princess he found he found them and

588
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:13,020
started using um using them and training

589
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,600
them up so that we can you know hand out

590
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,340
when we decided to retire which was

591
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:20,580
after year six we can hand it off to O.J

592
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,080
and hand it off to

593
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,600
um DNS yeah

594
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,299
so you know things worked well there uh

595
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:29,280
on that front so

596
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,780
um I think that's the you know that's

597
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,460
kind of the story of everything kind of

598
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,960
how we've structured we've grown over

599
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,700
the years we've added theming we've

600
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,980
added um some other good stuff we we

601
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,780
decided to expand the board and we and

602
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,299
we decided to expand the board too

603
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:44,220
um and one of the things I think we

604
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,400
wanted was uh outside view but someone

605
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,960
who had been at the con Alyssa had

606
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,179
already spoken at the con before

607
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:52,980
um and I think it even attended at least

608
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,000
once

609
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,740
um and so already kind of knew what we

610
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,080
were trying to do uh also was starting

611
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,840
to like start up her own con too with uh

612
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,940
with uh BTC yeah

613
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,520
um and uh yeah so that was there was a

614
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,440
lot of lessons learned to be shared but

615
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,840
also a nice outside perspective and I I

616
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,039
don't know if you know what Steve D3

617
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,780
looks like too but um he looks a lot

618
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:16,080
like bear and me and great and Alyssa

619
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,120
also doesn't and we need those outside

620
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,799
perspectives and we need perspectives

621
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:22,679
that are different and we we need also

622
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:25,980
to continue to you know uh get more

623
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,480
people into the board at some point

624
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,820
later down down the road who also have

625
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,020
different perspectives come from

626
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,580
different backgrounds because that's

627
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,320
super important to having at that at the

628
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,539
top leadership to ensure that you're

629
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:38,460
creating more of a community that is

630
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,679
more inclusive on down the chain all the

631
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:41,880
way down through your speakers your

632
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,440
attendees your volunteers years your

633
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,000
staff so

634
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,559
um you know that's that's we did that I

635
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,299
think I think last year we voted you on

636
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:50,820
yeah so uh now we have to decide whether

637
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,520
we keep you but anyway

638
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,919
that comes after this yeah but uh no I

639
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,640
think I think but let me think you bring

640
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,020
up a point that I want to touch on and

641
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,240
that is that idea of you know bringing

642
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,980
in multiple views or you know

643
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,320
perspectives whatever I mean the whole

644
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,120
moral of the story you heard from

645
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,700
everything that uh you know was just

646
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,380
described that first year I think a lot

647
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,720
of people you know in this industry we

648
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,039
go to these cons we love them to death

649
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,360
they're great and we think oh it'd be

650
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,740
really cool to start a tunnel I got to

651
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,260
do is you'll get some Hotel space stick

652
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,360
some projectors and screens and maybe

653
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,039
get somebody who owns some audio

654
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:28,440
equipment we're all set when you start

655
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,480
talking to the hotels or the event space

656
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,980
wherever you're going to do it even if

657
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,900
it's just a restaurant you start

658
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,480
learning there's a whole business behind

659
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,640
this that you don't understand coming

660
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,679
from the cyber security World unless

661
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:43,380
you've maybe worked in events before I

662
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,240
worked for a large reseller that did a

663
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,679
lot of events like this

664
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:51,120
and I got to see the kind of disgusting

665
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,840
underbelly at times of what goes on and

666
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,720
so seriously like you're thinking about

667
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,480
getting into a con and and starting your

668
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,000
own kind great like I mean

669
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,820
Community Driven cons where volunteers

670
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,799
want to jump in and do things that

671
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:10,440
that's how they're successful but bring

672
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,779
some people right away who understand

673
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:15,840
the business side of the world you are

674
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,760
good with contracts

675
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,320
um if you can find someone who actually

676
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,020
has event planning experience that would

677
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:25,080
be invaluable because dealing I know you

678
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,179
guys can speak to this dealing with the

679
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:30,539
hotels and their event people can be a

680
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:32,340
wonderful experience and it can be a

681
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,200
horrific experience because they know

682
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,400
what they're doing

683
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:39,059
and when you don't you don't always even

684
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:40,740
know the right questions to ask or what

685
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,080
you should be fighting for or you know

686
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,279
what you're sometimes what you're

687
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:46,980
committing to like the room block thing

688
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,539
when you know

689
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:51,000
and I think what the other you know

690
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,320
having gone through this with blue team

691
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,659
con just recently as we got into this

692
00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:56,700
you know people look at we'll look at

693
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,960
your con and they'll say why don't you

694
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,279
do this that would be you know it would

695
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,779
only cost you a few dollars it would

696
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:02,279
only cost you a few dollars to put

697
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:04,020
coffee in the hallways

698
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,220
um and then you find out that the hotel

699
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,080
charges you four hundred dollars a

700
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,320
gallon for coffee that costs them five

701
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,419
dollars to make plus Service Plus

702
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:14,580
service right right that's just the 400

703
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,799
is literally for the coffee I got a real

704
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,539
good exposure to that what was it was

705
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:20,279
either your one or two when I found out

706
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:22,860
how much they charged us for a per

707
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:26,700
Outlet like power out oh God yes it this

708
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,100
is what it comes down to it and you know

709
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,659
and the other thing you find that I

710
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:32,940
found through this Converses blue team

711
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,799
kind of is location matters

712
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,380
you know blue team Khan is in Chicago

713
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:40,380
and every Hotel in Chicago saved for a

714
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,179
few very select ones that are owned by

715
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:45,360
outside parties are subject to very

716
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,240
strict Union rules it's why at Blue Team

717
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,360
count we don't record talks right now

718
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:54,419
because the union rules require us to

719
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:56,940
use certain resources I didn't know that

720
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,539
and it would no joke double the budget

721
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:02,820
of the conference just to be able to

722
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,880
record our talks or to stream them live

723
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,880
and so you know these are all the things

724
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,500
you start to discover when you get into

725
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,880
this crazy world and see like oh really

726
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,960
cool

727
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,299
cool until you actually get into it

728
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:17,760
and then it's you know having done like

729
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,640
a solely virtual con and planned that

730
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,700
out actually multiple times like there

731
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,080
was a lot that was a lot easier about

732
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,779
that than trying to trying to do a

733
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:29,520
physical and it's not just the logistics

734
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,960
piece

735
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,779
so finding finding your team that's

736
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:36,720
absolutely critical the other uh you

737
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,880
know just sorry tangent on the um the

738
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,700
pricing uh when you start looking at

739
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,200
hotel pricing and you start looking at

740
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,960
event space pricing on things you know

741
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,880
and you see oh hey this little bottle of

742
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,940
coke is six bucks or Canada Coke is six

743
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,220
bucks a piece

744
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,960
um and you start looking at all that and

745
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,120
then you really kind of realize oh God

746
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,760
this makes like theme park and Movie

747
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,940
Theater prices look cheap it is an i o

748
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,679
is an eye-opener

749
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:06,419
um one of the big lessons I had to learn

750
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:08,640
was um actually this guy you know

751
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,039
getting this guy over here that's um

752
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,880
helped me out a lot second year I did

753
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,299
almost everything and no you almost

754
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:20,159
killed yourself right because I did

755
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,679
almost everything I took everything on

756
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:25,440
because I hadn't learned how to trust

757
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,559
and delegate and that is if if you are

758
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,179
the head person

759
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:33,059
that is the best lesson you need to

760
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:35,100
learn as quickly as possible trust your

761
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,419
people that they're going to do their

762
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:38,580
job you can't do it all yourself or you

763
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,200
will kill yourself it's just not going

764
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,299
to do there and what you'll also find is

765
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:44,100
as you start to delegate and you have

766
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,500
the people that you trust the con starts

767
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,080
to run better you don't have bottlenecks

768
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,760
you don't have it stuck there on that

769
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,039
front that's when I think that uh well

770
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,960
that was the year we first did the hmfic

771
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,820
system

772
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,620
um which had in charge if

773
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:01,080
you're not familiar with that but that

774
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,880
system I was actually kind of happy to

775
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,200
see that that system was still in place

776
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,820
for this year when I saw that like

777
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:06,960
warmed my heart a little bit when

778
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,000
someone said oh yeah I'm the hmfic oh

779
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,419
cool you kept my thing all right

780
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:14,640
but that's the thing delegation you you

781
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,860
need to delegate you really got to do

782
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,380
that if you don't you will you your con

783
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,760
is never going to be as good as it can

784
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,679
be as long as you if you delegate to a

785
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:24,000
strong team and there's also a pattern

786
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,919
here developing of Vicious Cycles right

787
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,659
like this goes back to making sure that

788
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,100
you've got a good team you've got to

789
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,720
have good people around you who aren't

790
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,640
going to be loafing and disappearing so

791
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,260
they can go shave themselves for

792
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:37,080
whatever God knows reason right I mean

793
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,600
and actually supporting the ideas that

794
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,100
they that they are trying to bring to

795
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,140
life but you've gotta if you if you

796
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,460
don't have good people you're not going

797
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,500
to be able to trust them and if you

798
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,659
can't trust them then you're not going

799
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:50,399
to be able to surround yourself with

800
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:53,159
more good people so yeah let's I want to

801
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:55,080
actually go back to volunteers because I

802
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,700
I can't

803
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,260
stress this enough I think every kind

804
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,299
I've been to they do a really good job

805
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:02,940
at the end thanking the volunteers

806
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:05,580
and it might it might sound a little bit

807
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,500
like platitude when it happens but the

808
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,659
reality is you just heard it described

809
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,399
here how people who didn't even

810
00:31:11,399 --> 00:31:13,500
officially volunteer will be the

811
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,360
lifeblood of your conference

812
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,000
uh volunteers mean everything but you

813
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,100
also have to understand

814
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,899
who volunteers are

815
00:31:21,899 --> 00:31:24,240
they are people who as you said are

816
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,820
they're working for free and so while

817
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,559
you have to understand you're going to

818
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,840
need to rely on them and you're going to

819
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,000
need them there you also have to plan

820
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,860
for the areas where they're not going to

821
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,860
be there right you cannot count on

822
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,779
volunteers to be there after the

823
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:41,159
conference to help you load the truck

824
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:44,220
and get it back to a storage unit or

825
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,320
wherever it's going because they're

826
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,820
volunteers that's not their job they're

827
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,500
not getting paid they're not gonna they

828
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,419
have no stake in the conference itself

829
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:54,480
you can't expect them now some may still

830
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,679
be there it may show up but you as the

831
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:00,120
conference organizers that's your job

832
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,000
right I mean you don't have that luxury

833
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,159
of being able to just assume or to

834
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:09,000
command people to be there unless you

835
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,100
specifically set up volunteers to do

836
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,740
those things and so working with the

837
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,200
volunteers there again is a case where

838
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,580
if you can find somebody who's done that

839
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,559
before who really understands that space

840
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:22,140
of coordinating volunteers we've got

841
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,340
some really good folks that do it here

842
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,679
so City we've got some really good folks

843
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,840
that blue team kind of do it too in fact

844
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,159
one of those happens to be the same

845
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:30,600
person

846
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,000
um because we learn from each other you

847
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,500
know and and you use the term about

848
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,799
competing earlier I think it was you

849
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,880
which I know you didn't mean it that way

850
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,220
but also don't look at you're not

851
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,980
competing with other cons

852
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,380
I mean we've become between blue team

853
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:49,080
Khan and Circle City pretty close in

854
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,480
Sharing Lessons Learned and ideas and

855
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,980
information just in the two years that

856
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,620
blue team cons existed and I I think

857
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,720
that's incredibly important I think it's

858
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,980
going to make both conferences a lot

859
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,360
better yeah that that's actually

860
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,620
something and thank you for bringing

861
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,580
that up because that's something I

862
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,440
forgot to mention

863
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,200
um so first off yeah some I know some

864
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,940
people out there think that there are

865
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,500
competitions between a lot of the

866
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,740
conferences there really aren't

867
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,419
small Pockets exist yes but for the most

868
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:19,340
part it's kind of like um I there's a

869
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,360
camaraderie against amongst the people

870
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,039
that run conferences because we all know

871
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,860
how hard it is I mean take won't take

872
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:28,200
wolf out there who who's been out there

873
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,120
and I know when we first got started we

874
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,880
did some stuff with uh convergence with

875
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,860
um with uh the conference wolf was

876
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:37,740
running in um uh Detroit at the time

877
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:40,080
so we've done you know we've worked with

878
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:40,799
them

879
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,840
um we had some help from uh we had a

880
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,820
little bit of help from um Derby con at

881
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,539
the time from uh from Dave

882
00:33:47,539 --> 00:33:49,919
just getting that but the person that

883
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,240
helped us the most

884
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,059
was Heidi Potter from

885
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:56,880
so if anyone says a bad word about Heidi

886
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,320
in front of me I will cut you because

887
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,779
because I like that's the I don't even

888
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:02,399
have to know what it is that's someone I

889
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:04,380
have their back for for life it's you

890
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,120
know ride or die

891
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:10,759
um well we'll coach him on the COC later

892
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,080
so

893
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,659
Heidi the first so Heidi gave tons of

894
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:17,280
advice

895
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,020
um she showed up to the first several

896
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,760
conferences as well and really helped

897
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,839
out

898
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,300
um but the biggest thing was either year

899
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,699
three or four

900
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:29,399
yeah we didn't make enough money

901
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:32,460
we were about what six grand I think

902
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,320
six grand short we didn't have the money

903
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,119
we sold the pre-tickets we just we

904
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:37,199
didn't have it

905
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,780
and we could not pay our bills

906
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:44,940
and so I went head in hand and said

907
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:47,219
I hate to ask this is there any way you

908
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:49,080
can lend us some money just for a little

909
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,580
bit we will pay you back as quickly as

910
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:54,418
possible didn't even hesitate

911
00:34:54,418 --> 00:34:57,420
send us the money and well you tell the

912
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,000
story because you paid her back

913
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,940
so essentially she said yeah I want a

914
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,800
silver sponsorship

915
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,160
which isn't isn't the full value of what

916
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,619
she gave us and we're like oh wow but

917
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:11,760
that's only worth this she's like that's

918
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,740
fine just put her logo on stuff you know

919
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:14,700
everything we don't need a booth or

920
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,839
anything just put our logo on stuff

921
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:17,700
wrenching us thank us well that's good

922
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,560
I'm like oh that's awesome

923
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,060
and it's just like and then pay me the

924
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,980
remainder of that value and which was

925
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,720
two thousand dollars and so I was like

926
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,119
okay and sure enough that got us through

927
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,940
we started our ticket sales uh for the

928
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,220
con and we had some early sponsors come

929
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:35,280
in and everything and by January so our

930
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,040
conference ended in June right and by

931
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,760
January we had enough money that I was

932
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,160
able to go to shmukh Khan that year and

933
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,619
I was able to write the check and I was

934
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:48,900
able to say Heidi I want to thank you so

935
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,420
much for making sure that we were able

936
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:54,119
to survive and you know I every every

937
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:56,520
year I every time I met schmoo I go to

938
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,920
Heidi I give her challenge coin I give

939
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,260
her something from Circle citycon every

940
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:04,859
year to say we got to year eight we got

941
00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:06,780
to your nine this year I told her we got

942
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,339
to year nine

943
00:36:08,339 --> 00:36:10,140
because we wouldn't have made it to year

944
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,240
four if you hadn't stepped in

945
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,579
and cheeks usually kind of tears up or

946
00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:15,839
whatever with that we have a good hug

947
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:19,500
but you know that's that's you know we

948
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,420
don't compete we really do support each

949
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,339
other now obviously there's the reality

950
00:36:23,339 --> 00:36:26,099
of having having a con the week after

951
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:28,320
shmur before shmoo that's not a good

952
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,780
idea there's a reality there but no one

953
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:33,000
competes uh other than just the

954
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,800
practicality of competing for time

955
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,500
that's about it any other shout outs uh

956
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,240
I want to give to someone that was very

957
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,160
instrumental who's no longer with us is

958
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,560
uh rants so I don't know all of you

959
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,240
don't know I I'm sure some of you don't

960
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:49,320
know Rands but a lot of you do and um

961
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,760
yeah

962
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,460
Rance was again Rance was an attendee he

963
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:56,220
did uh DJing the for us a couple years

964
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,839
uh he unfortunately passed away from

965
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:00,359
cancer a few years ago

966
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:02,940
um and he's very much missed but all the

967
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,320
trainings that you see at Circle city

968
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,640
con

969
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,320
um we had a couple trains and we're

970
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,119
going to continue him and I was at

971
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,040
Defcon talking to him

972
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,359
and

973
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:14,460
he goes you know what you need to do is

974
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,440
just put as many trainings as possible

975
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,020
in there like load it up do like 10 12

976
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,960
16 but don't charge for them

977
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,300
and I look him and go that is the

978
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:27,599
smartest idea I have ever heard and

979
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,700
that's how all the trainings happened so

980
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,560
Circle City kind of a big part of circle

981
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,440
seek on the way it is is because of the

982
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,660
fact that he suggested that to me and

983
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:37,980
that's really kind of how this whole

984
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:40,920
conference is we like to find the things

985
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,660
at other conferences that we love and

986
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,820
bring them all and use them here heavy

987
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,680
theming that was the thing you know that

988
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,140
was the thing we introduced in there uh

989
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,579
some of the games we've done over the

990
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:52,920
years that was uh stuff coming from um

991
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,660
uh you know kind of like Comic Cons

992
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,220
things like that

993
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,079
um the trainings rants gave us ideas we

994
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,760
like to find all that and we like the

995
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,380
community input and that's how we grow

996
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,060
and build the con our egos are not so

997
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,619
big that we are not willing to listen to

998
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:07,020
people and try to make the conference

999
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,760
better and that's one of actually the

1000
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,800
cool things about running icon is yeah

1001
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,560
you you can not only take the things you

1002
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,880
like in other kinds that you've seen

1003
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,619
before and bring that together

1004
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:19,140
you can also experiment you can try new

1005
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,780
things we did something that blue team

1006
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:24,000
con and I feel like I'm talking about

1007
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,200
blue team kind of a lot sorry about that

1008
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,119
I don't know but it's great confidence

1009
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,460
you should go one thing that we we tried

1010
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,380
that I think had been seen at like maybe

1011
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:34,020
a couple conferences but not it's not

1012
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,760
real common is the idea of an

1013
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,160
unconference where basically people show

1014
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,440
up day of and it's first come first

1015
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,700
serve you just sign up to give a

1016
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,740
20-minute talk and we have a whole room

1017
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,680
that's just 20 minute talks all day long

1018
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,839
not gonna live we're stealing that idea

1019
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:51,359
maybe please do it honestly it's really

1020
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:52,859
cool because you have people who didn't

1021
00:38:52,859 --> 00:38:54,599
get accepted to the cfp but are still

1022
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:55,859
there and would like to still share

1023
00:38:55,859 --> 00:38:58,200
their ideas you get people who want to

1024
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,820
try out something new that they're

1025
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:02,339
planning or I mean you get first-time

1026
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:03,900
speakers who's never given a talk and

1027
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,940
they want to just try what it's like to

1028
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,200
stand up in front of them one thing that

1029
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,540
was cool I saw

1030
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:12,359
sponsors love that because they went in

1031
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:13,859
there and gave their 20-minute talk

1032
00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:16,140
about some subject matter expertise

1033
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,520
thing that they just have a slide deck

1034
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,960
for and they whip that up there and did

1035
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,240
that and they were taking pictures of

1036
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,220
that and putting it on LinkedIn and

1037
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,780
putting it on Twitter and showing that

1038
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,400
they're Personnel this is the business

1039
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,140
side and for the business side of things

1040
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,640
from the business side of things making

1041
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,760
your sponsors happy is also good we try

1042
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,820
to not sell sponsor spots for speakers

1043
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,980
there's some other creative ways we can

1044
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,720
get around that with possibly some

1045
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,339
executive content and other things like

1046
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:42,839
that but

1047
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:45,119
the unconference where anybody can go in

1048
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,400
it's still a talk it's still getting

1049
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,839
your ideas out there it's still

1050
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:52,079
communicating that to to an audience and

1051
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:53,820
they love being able to say our speakers

1052
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:56,339
spoke at this area here and here's what

1053
00:39:56,339 --> 00:39:58,800
they had to say or this and that that

1054
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,359
could really help so that's just a

1055
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:01,859
little little tip that I saw from that

1056
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:03,780
that I immediately saw the value to that

1057
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:04,980
from the sponsor site because that was

1058
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,920
my bread and butter let's talk sponsors

1059
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,760
for a minute because that's another

1060
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,900
interesting

1061
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,180
I mean you guys know this as well as

1062
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,579
sponsors

1063
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:16,380
sponsors of lifeblood right I mean as

1064
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:19,740
many tickets as you may sell I I don't

1065
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,180
know a conference out there that

1066
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,460
survives without sponsors yeah

1067
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,920
um you just can't there's just you know

1068
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,320
right exactly Carolina's the only one

1069
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,700
I've ever seen that's been able to pull

1070
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,579
it off and and that was a

1071
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:34,500
string shoestring that they did you're

1072
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,579
just not going to have the cool stuff

1073
00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:36,660
that you want to have you're not gonna

1074
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,800
have the really nice rooms really nice

1075
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,940
projectors you're not going to have all

1076
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,380
the food and beverage and other things

1077
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,700
you're not going to have parties because

1078
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,920
you just can't afford to do that but

1079
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,599
what if you're starting a conference I

1080
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,460
think the thing you have to just be

1081
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,020
aware of and this isn't a good or a bad

1082
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,000
thing but we're all in security we're

1083
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,940
kind of idealistic

1084
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:55,500
and when the sponsors get involved

1085
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,440
they're going to push you to make

1086
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,720
certain compromises because there are

1087
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,160
other events that do things you

1088
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,960
mentioned selling

1089
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,540
um you know uh speaking slots thankfully

1090
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,579
we don't do that either in blue team we

1091
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:10,800
don't do that here at Circle City none

1092
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,119
of the cons I've ever been involved in

1093
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:13,980
do that I personally don't like that

1094
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,480
idea

1095
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,300
um unless there's you know like black

1096
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,520
panthers black hat does their thing and

1097
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,500
RSA does it too where like a sponsor get

1098
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,359
there's like a sponsor talks area but

1099
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:25,500
that's a little different

1100
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,180
but you know it's gonna be other things

1101
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,020
like they're going to watch your

1102
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:30,119
attendee list because for a lot of these

1103
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:31,740
sponsors that's the value they get out

1104
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,300
of it or that's what they think they get

1105
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,760
out of it in terms of value is a list of

1106
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,480
potential leads so understanding not not

1107
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,339
saying you have to give that up

1108
00:41:41,339 --> 00:41:44,099
but have a plan for how you're going to

1109
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:45,720
deal with that request when a sponsor

1110
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,460
asks because they are going to ask

1111
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,200
that's something that most of them are

1112
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,940
going to want

1113
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,380
um and then you know you mentioned like

1114
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:55,500
the the levels the reason that exists is

1115
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,320
to give sponsors a very clear view

1116
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,480
of this is what you're getting for your

1117
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,099
money this is what you're not getting

1118
00:42:02,099 --> 00:42:03,240
for that money

1119
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,940
and let them kind of choose what fits

1120
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,619
for them which reminds me the

1121
00:42:07,619 --> 00:42:09,660
sponsorless that brought up uh one thing

1122
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,099
another little quick thing I just want

1123
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:12,359
to say and if you're ever going to run a

1124
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:13,260
con

1125
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,960
so we had um what was it year three I

1126
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:18,359
think after that we used to do uh opt

1127
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:19,980
out of

1128
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:23,160
um of the sponsor lists and a you know

1129
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,420
it was at the start of the tickets it

1130
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:26,760
was opt out and

1131
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,220
um one of the sponsors sent a mass email

1132
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:31,320
out to the people that were on the list

1133
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,540
because you know it was opt out

1134
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,820
and that created a bit of an uproar on

1135
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:38,099
Twitter now I'm on there and I started

1136
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:38,940
getting in there and I started

1137
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,740
responding to the first couple of people

1138
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,900
just saying hey no this is opt out

1139
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,880
everything like that and when I started

1140
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,200
to notice is the mob turns

1141
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,060
when you were dealing with social media

1142
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,880
mobs especially on Twitter

1143
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,980
that's a losing battle you can be a

1144
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,780
hundred percent in the right

1145
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:00,240
it's going to be often a losing battle

1146
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,760
if the mob turns on you so at one it's

1147
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,319
finally when I started seeing it I

1148
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,140
basically go you know what we up

1149
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:10,740
I'm sorry we're going to move into uh

1150
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:14,220
opt-in going forward and that was and it

1151
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:15,540
there were a couple more comments and

1152
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:16,920
then it died

1153
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,720
but that's something you've got to be

1154
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,720
very very very careful on crisis comes

1155
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,119
yeah and now if I may so they said at

1156
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:26,280
the beginning one of my obligations and

1157
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,079
privileges of sitting on the board is

1158
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,180
making sure that trains tend to run on

1159
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:32,220
time and we're about three minutes from

1160
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:34,800
the scheduled stop of this chatter and I

1161
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,400
hate to say it

1162
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:39,720
okay so I just wanted to make sure that

1163
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,880
we're we're aware of the time and uh

1164
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,040
that we okay so yeah I was just going to

1165
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:47,119
say let's open up for some questions

1166
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:49,980
so so this is a great opportunity I

1167
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:52,020
think for questions about if you want to

1168
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:54,060
do your own con no matter what size or

1169
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:57,420
or what you would like to see here as

1170
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:01,099
well uh you sir

1171
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,839
okay

1172
00:44:19,319 --> 00:44:21,839
all right so Garrett said uh that how do

1173
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:24,180
you contact sponsors uh and get the

1174
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:25,500
sponsors that you want I'm gonna get

1175
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,540
this OJ because he's been our sponsored

1176
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:30,839
Guru when you find that out come tell me

1177
00:44:30,839 --> 00:44:33,180
uh it's lead generation so you're on

1178
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:35,280
sales too right so as sponsors you're

1179
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,780
you're a sales person

1180
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,640
um and so nowadays we get to treat it

1181
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,980
more like donor management but

1182
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:42,780
um it's still very much is sales and a

1183
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,160
lot of times the folks you're dealing

1184
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,980
with in infosec vendors they are sales

1185
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:50,520
organizations so you can do a few things

1186
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,680
first of all start looking at who is

1187
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:55,200
sponsoring other events

1188
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,079
um start looking on doing some oceans so

1189
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:00,660
practice our enumeration uh that we do

1190
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:03,599
uh in in in in attacking networks right

1191
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,400
so enumerate things

1192
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,500
key targets oh yeah we're starting to

1193
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,240
talk threat threat actor wise key

1194
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,160
targets for your enumeration shall be

1195
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:14,400
field marketing specialists event

1196
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,060
coordinators or simply sales reps

1197
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:21,180
account Executives or the dreaded

1198
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:23,520
security consultant who's actually a

1199
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,640
security sales rep

1200
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,839

1201
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:30,780

00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:37,440

1205
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,000

coordinator or field marketing that I

1215
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,780
can get a hold of I think those that's

1216
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:02,579
probably your better way to go in such a

1217
00:46:02,579 --> 00:46:04,560
short notice but that'll help you build

1218
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,960
that contact list the other thing I will

1219
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,940
say to that is understand too how this

1220
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:09,780
works especially with large

1221
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:12,060
organizations if you're thinking hey I

1222
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,980
want to get Microsoft to sponsor you are

1223
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:15,780
not calling Redmond Washington and

1224
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:17,660
trying to talk to someone at Microsoft

1225
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:20,220
you are looking for the that's an

1226
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:21,660
extreme example but this is even for

1227
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:24,480
smaller companies most of them have some

1228
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,480
sort of regional sales office and in a

1229
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,980
lot of those organizations

1230
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:31,440
that Regional sales office has a budget

1231
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,020
for this kind of thing because it's just

1232
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:35,819
a sales office that's all they do and so

1233
00:46:35,819 --> 00:46:37,859
they're always looking for how do we how

1234
00:46:37,859 --> 00:46:39,540
do we get leads how are we going to do

1235
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:42,660
Biz Dev you know and that so A lot of

1236
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:43,920
times if you're looking at like maybe a

1237
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,200
little bit larger organization if you

1238
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:49,380
can find the field office that's

1239
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:51,660
responsible for your area

1240
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:53,460
they'll tend to be a little more

1241
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:56,400
interested than say you know the this

1242
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,800
the corporate you know headquarters off

1243
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,599
in New York or something who couldn't

1244
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:01,980
care less about what's going on in

1245
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:05,400
Indiana right so that is a key strategy

1246
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,200
there too I know we used to deal with

1247
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,540
that when I worked for a reseller a lot

1248
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,339
of our partners that was how that stuff

1249
00:47:11,339 --> 00:47:13,640
would happen was just our our local

1250
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:17,160
Regional sales office often Texas would

1251
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,440
go you know sponsor something in in

1252
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,380
their local area so that can be a way a

1253
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:24,420
lot of times too to break through rather

1254
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:25,920
than trying to hunt through like a

1255
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,839
corporate structure and find the right

1256
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:29,520
person just talk to your local sales

1257
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,380
people and they may be interested

1258
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:32,520
because hey that's an opportunity for

1259
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,800
them to get sales absolutely all right

1260
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,300
any other questions

1261
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:39,380
yes you sir

1262
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:44,220
yeah uh you know we appreciate the

1263
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:45,780
suggestion that's something that we will

1264
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:47,339
uh definitely take under advice and

1265
00:47:47,339 --> 00:47:49,200
consider

1266
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,520
and I know we like to try and change

1267
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:52,020
things up too right

1268
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:54,180
right although the arcades do kind of

1269
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:55,079
stay

1270
00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:57,060
notice of new games in the arcade area

1271
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:58,740
that the department there's pinball

1272
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:00,839
machines uh but we do like to change it

1273
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:02,880
up but yeah definitely

1274
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,319
definitely it's definitely

1275
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:08,900
uh any additional questions yes sir

1276
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:12,119
go through before you get

1277
00:48:12,119 --> 00:48:14,400
yeah so you you definitely know the

1278
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,540
history

1279
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:17,700
um so this was a weird year because it's

1280
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:19,440
a return from pandemic right so

1281
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,900
everybody has seen a massive decrease in

1282
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,940
the amount of submissions

1283
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:26,339
um so in our height we would usually get

1284
00:48:26,339 --> 00:48:28,980
94 submissions and then we would have to

1285
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:33,119
pick 40 to 50. somewhere like that to do

1286
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,160
three tracks of trainings each day this

1287
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:38,880
year we I think maybe got

1288
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,460
I think we've maybe got 50 talks total

1289
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:44,640
submitted it was not an when we scored

1290
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,319
when we did everything it was not enough

1291
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:49,260
to fill three tracks so we went down to

1292
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,599
single track Friday single track Sunday

1293
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:53,579
two tracks Saturday like we're doing

1294
00:48:53,579 --> 00:48:55,800
today and that was enough so we were

1295
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,420
good there and we plugged in this board

1296
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:58,560
talk too because it's a great

1297
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,780
opportunity and uh we did it during the

1298
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:03,240
virtual years too but uh we wanted to um

1299
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,040
also participate as well and kind of

1300
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,540
kind of share that and fill space as

1301
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:07,859
well but that's that's about what you

1302
00:49:07,859 --> 00:49:12,180
can get yeah I think one I think 165 was

1303
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:14,160
our best year that we've uh we've had it

1304
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,859

1307
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:38,280
that's a good question um all right so

1308
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,500
we'll start the talk times um yeah real

1309
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,000
quick year two

1310
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,579
um I made these stupid decision

1311
00:49:44,579 --> 00:49:47,099
to uh open top yeah was it set seven or

1312
00:49:47,099 --> 00:49:48,300
eight I don't remember all I remember

1313
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:50,400
was getting up

1314
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,900
yeah

1315
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:54,540
yeah and I remember sitting there with

1316
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:56,880
with like it was you right it was you

1317
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,339
and Natasha that was her name okay I've

1318
00:49:59,339 --> 00:50:00,359
been trying to think of her name all

1319
00:50:00,359 --> 00:50:02,220
weekend I and this girl Natasha that was

1320
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:04,200
volunteering at the time and we just all

1321
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,640
sat there in silence for about 45

1322
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,740
minutes trying to wake up and just

1323
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:11,240
looked at him I go never again

1324
00:50:11,339 --> 00:50:13,800
um didn't think so yes I recommend don't

1325
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,960
start talks before 10 honestly I I think

1326
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,579
you're nuts especially the day after a

1327
00:50:17,579 --> 00:50:19,260
party you're absolutely out of your mind

1328
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:21,900
if you do uh in terms of not showing up

1329
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:23,880
um it just kind of depends sometimes you

1330
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,560
have to close off the track and just say

1331
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:28,200
we don't have it other times you have

1332
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:28,800
um

1333
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,140
speakers ready to go but typically you

1334
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:33,660
need like um I mean there's a handful of

1335
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:35,400
us because we've had we've there's been

1336
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,380
times when I mean one years one of you

1337
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:38,819

1338
00:50:38,819 --> 00:50:41,000
you go fill this room and I'll yeah sure

1339
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,619

1340
00:50:43,619 --> 00:50:45,000

1341

have a talk so I just yeah pulled

1342
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:49,260
something out of my rear but usually you

1343
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:51,240
want to pick five or six alternate

1344
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,559
speakers because you're gonna have to

1345
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:55,260
there's you up to the month before the

1346
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:57,300
con you're gonna have cancellations so

1347
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:58,680
you're gonna deal with that but then day

1348
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,540
of like you said and it's nice to have

1349
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:03,900
people on staff who can give a talk uh

1350
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:06,240
