1
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,020
well good afternoon

2
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,460
all right all right all right I know

3
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,740
it's five o'clock it's late most people

4
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,220
are like ready to get to food but you

5
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,680
all are like interested in hearing about

6
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,840
SCA or maybe you saw my tweet and you

7
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,460
want to hear about some other topics but

8
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,160
welcome aboard good to have you here one

9
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,739
way or the other so let's dive in what

10
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:45,719
what am I even talking about that tweet

11
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:48,300
if you didn't see it

12
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,860
the prime Museum followed me on Twitter

13
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,379
but for those of you who do you know

14
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:56,340
that I am working on my Pilot's

15
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,379
certificate

16
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,180
um this was a lifelong dream of mine

17
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,059
something I started on

18
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:05,760
the beginning of this year I guess

19
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,600
um

20
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,360
as part of that as things would work out

21
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,560
I ended up actually buying an airplane

22
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,820
now

23
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,619
y'all probably did not come here to hear

24
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,360
about airplanes

25
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,979
but trust me we'll get there in a minute

26
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,920
so let's talk about airplanes for a

27
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,140
second because

28
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,920
airplane safety and even just aircraft

29
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,380
operations there are there are things

30
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,840
that we can learn from that and things

31
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,020
that kind of draw parallels to what we

32
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,000
really should be looking at when we

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,259
start thinking about application

34
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,240
security is specifically open source

35
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,040
security so let me start to draw that

36
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,960
parallel for you for those of you that

37
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,540
have never flown a plane before

38
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,880
you may have been on a commercial flight

39
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,700
at one point where you heard maybe

40
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,960
you're being delayed for a few minutes

41
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,340
on the ground you heard them talking

42
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,840
maybe they made an announcement they

43
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,220
were talking about they had to get the

44
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,979
weight right

45
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:03,299
so that's the thing in aviation when you

46
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,159
fly a little plane like this it becomes

47
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,259
really really really important how much

48
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:09,000
weight is in the plane and how is that

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,599
weight distributed across the plane

50
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,280
some other things are really important

51
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,319
when you're flying an airplane is

52
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,540
knowing all of the equipment that is on

53
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,620
that plane

54
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,780
so one of the things that you get when

55
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,780
you buy an airplane is you get you know

56
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,940
essentially you know we call it a

57
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,160
pilot's operating handbook you also you

58
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,540
might think of it like an owner's manual

59
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,760
right one of the things in there is this

60
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,980
equipment list

61
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,739
this is every piece of equipment that is

62
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:39,959
installed in that airplane

63
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,360
and it comes in that POA is that pile is

64
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,160
operating a handbook now there's two

65
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,860
reasons they give this to you first is

66
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,180
for that weight and balance I was

67
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,340
talking about so you can you see here

68
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,140
kind of towards the end and actually all

69
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,459
along they're giving you different data

70
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:54,959
I know it's like tiny you can't really

71
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,060
read it but all the data you see in the

72
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,319
right hand Columns of each of those

73
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,300
pages talks about what does this thing

74
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,940
weigh and where is it in relation to the

75
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,980
center of gravity of the aircraft

76
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,959
all so we can get the balance right so

77
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,580
the plane flies correctly so we don't

78
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,760
crash into Terrain

79
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,140
the other thing this gives you is it

80
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,780
gives you an inventory of all of the

81
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,879
equipment that's installed because when

82
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,159
you're dealing with what the FAA calls a

83
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,260
certificated airplane this is an

84
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,780
airplane that has all components and

85
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,040
everything else has been approved by the

86
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,379
FAA not just individually but in their

87
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:30,480
combined State together inside that

88
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,500
aircraft

89
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,739
so we track all this

90
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:36,780
now that's what it looks like for a

91
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,580
little plane like mine

92
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,120
but then there's big planes like this

93
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,780
737 Max eight yes that's 737 Max 8 right

94
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,319
I get it we'll come back to that later

95
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:51,299
but that same list that you saw there

96
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:53,099
they produced the same list for these

97
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:56,040
planes that same balance and weight data

98
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,379
they have for these planes because it's

99
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:00,060
just as critical when we're talking

100
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,340
about a large commercial aircraft as it

101
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,480
is when we're talking about that small

102
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,760
aircraft now you saw the one from mines

103
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,040
about six pages long

104
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,180
the 737 Max 8 it's 155 pages long I know

105
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,819
because I looked it up last night

106
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:17,699
um but this is legitimate information

107
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:19,978
but it's all information that the FAA

108
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:22,380
requires in order to understand

109
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,419
everything that's installed in these

110
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:26,160
aircrafts so that when things go wrong

111
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,380
we can understand why

112
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,120
but also of course to try to make sure

113
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,860
that things don't go wrong in the first

114
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,500
place if a component has a known failure

115
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,259
that's caused crashes we'll talk about

116
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:39,360
that in a minute

117
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,699
we can look that up we know what planes

118
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,620
they're installed in

119
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,440
so now are you starting to see why maybe

120
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,060
this has something to do with our open

121
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,220
source software and why we would care

122
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,240
about this sort of thing with

123
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,060
application security

124
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,000
so that's where we're headed now uh for

125
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,320
those of you that don't know me really

126
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,540
quick intro first of all again my name

127
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,979
is Alyssa Miller

128
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:04,259
and first and foremost I'm a hacker and

129
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:06,000
a researcher been a hacker my whole life

130
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,500
I bought my first computer when I was 12

131
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,320
I broke into Prodigy so half of the room

132
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,419
hopefully at least understands what I'm

133
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:14,100
talking about there's some folks in here

134
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,040
who have no idea what Prodigy is but

135
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,759
that's okay so it was a dial-up service

136
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,259
that you could dial to before we had the

137
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:23,820
internet

138
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,919
um but that that's you know that's kind

139
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,600
of my personality from the very

140
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,520
beginning of my life um I've always been

141
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,020
that that type of person who is really

142
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,600
curious I like to break things like to

143
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,699
take my toys take them apart figure out

144
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:36,600
how they work

145
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,000
take my parents VCR take that apart do

146
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,440
you even know wait you guys know what a

147
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,520
VCR is at least right

148
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:48,000
um I've update your analogies all right

149
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,680
so

150
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,419
you know but I did that you know most of

151
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:53,100
my parents sugar in sometimes when some

152
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,080
of their Electronics were in pieces on

153
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,120
the living room floor but that's you

154
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,039
know that's just kind of my thing

155
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,580
uh if you looked at the website you saw

156
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,060
it lists me as a biso for s p Global

157
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,000
yeah that not anymore

158
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,860
um this is a kind of recent thing and I

159
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,660
think it's actually my fault I think I

160
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,419
didn't actually send over the update I

161
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:17,880
am now the CSO at a company called epic

162
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,860
Global so we are a global organization

163
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,080
as the name would imply we do legally

164
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,900
Discovery Services things like that

165
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,520
I'm an author and a blogger really

166
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,500
quickly just I don't really blog very

167
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,520
often

168
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,280
my website's kind of out of date but I

169
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,259
am an author I did recently release a

170
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:36,120
book uh we can talk about that

171
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,860
afterwards

172
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,419
um actually there's two copies of it I

173
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:42,360
think available in the auction too so

174
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,699
and then finally here's why I care about

175
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:46,800
all this I'm a former software developer

176
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,600
all right so I've been in the shoes of

177
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,740
software Dev

178
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,860
I've worked in application development

179
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:56,160
organizations most of my career in some

180
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,780
way shape or former another even in

181
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,580
consultancy I've always kind of been

182
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,199
focused on appsec because that's my

183
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,840
roots that's where I came from

184
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,100
so

185
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,539
that's why I'm up here talking about

186
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:08,160
application security because it's

187
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,919
something near and dear to my heart

188
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:13,620
so let's talk about how we develop

189
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,819
software

190
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:19,199
25 years ago when I started as a

191
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,300
software developer I just really dated

192
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,759
myself again

193
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,419
um

194
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:26,099
I should have a pool running y'all could

195
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:28,860
guess how old I am but uh when I was a

196
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,940
software developer if you had an

197
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,460
application that was 800 000 lines of

198
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,259
code that meant your developers in your

199
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:37,740
organization wrote 800 000 lines of code

200
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,259
it ain't that way anymore

201
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,840
because we have these cool open source

202
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,120
community in these package managers that

203
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,699
we can leverage to pull code from the

204
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:50,039
open source community so now I write an

205
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:52,380
application it might be 80 000 lines of

206
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,300
code that I've written but the entire

207
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,099
application turns out to be hundreds of

208
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:59,039
thousands of lines so for instance we

209
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,479
just we use things like these package

210
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,819
managers to say Hey you know go grab

211
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:04,560
this package that does this common task

212
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,380
go grab this package of this common task

213
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,020
and what's really cool about this is not

214
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,360
only then do I have this manifest like

215
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,819
you see here that says hey here's all

216
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:16,380
the dependencies from the open source

217
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,599
community that I want my package manager

218
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:21,120
Maven to go grab and include in my

219
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,560
software because I call different

220
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,360
components of it

221
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,020
but now each of those packages has its

222
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,240
own dependencies oh and then those

223
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,919
dependencies have more dependencies of

224
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,779
their own and in those dependencies have

225
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,880
more dependencies of Their Own

226
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,799
now try and go figure out how much open

227
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:41,159
source you have in your software that 80

228
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,979
000 lines I wrote turns into 800 000

229
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:47,580
lines right this is the story of modern

230
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,720
development

231
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,880
it is the best and worst case scenario

232
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,860
from a development perspective it's what

233
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,140
we've we preached way back when I was a

234
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,180
developer it was all about code reuse

235
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,160
and we we started trying to create you

236
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,620
know we had dlls that you know you could

237
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,120
use that and you could create classes

238
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,820
and you share those dlls amongst

239
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,140
different software you could leverage

240
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,180
all that well now we've got open source

241
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,740
so somebody creates something really

242
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,839
really cool like maybe something that

243
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:15,860
writes logs

244
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,160
foreshadowing that's what that is

245
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,260
and we can all use it

246
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,000
and we go because why should I have to

247
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,920
write my own logging mechanism somebody

248
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,560
already wrote all that and instead we

249
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,240
can all just contribute to it we can all

250
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,560
make it really good and make it really

251
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,300
cool and because everybody's looking at

252
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,560
it it makes it more secure right

253
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:40,800
the silence scares me because it should

254
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,980
be a hell no but we'll get there so

255
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,480
that's the story of modern day

256
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,920
development

257
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,620
so what could possibly go

258
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,959
I mean this is breathe everybody's

259
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:53,820
looking everybody's in there they can

260
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,740
make code that the maintainers you know

261
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,360
what if they if they get a pull request

262
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,440
they still have the opportunity to

263
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,760
review that and they can make sure that

264
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,040
it codes right so clearly everything

265
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,660
that we're going to use from the open

266
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,180
source Community is going to be awesome

267
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,220
it's going to be great because it's gone

268
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,360
through all this and now we've got

269
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,220
people like GitHub are putting in you

270
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,720
know different code scanners and all

271
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,300
that in into their you know into repos

272
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,500
and everything else this is awesome

273
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,240
we're going to secure that stuff

274
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,180
yeah I'm going back there okay I know it

275
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,399
was like five years ago Alyssa

276
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,060
God stop talking about Equifax we get it

277
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,060
but Equifax is still one of the one of

278
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,880
the perfect examples of

279
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,740
the challenges of Open Source

280
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,420
dependencies

281
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,160
because if you don't know what happened

282
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,660
at Equifax with their breach

283
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,480
epic epic reach okay I mean this was

284
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,800
this was one of the big ones

285
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,240
we have this vulnerability and struts

286
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,620
you know cve 2017

287
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:01,339
5638 I always forget

288
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,899
we knew about it we knew about it for

289
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:05,579
quite a while

290
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:07,079
what facts knew about it they went on

291
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:11,300
they fixed it in a whole lot of places

292
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:12,779
but they didn't know every place they

293
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:14,640
had it and this was a story with a lot

294
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,920
of people it wasn't just Equifax is just

295
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,899
the ones who ultimately fell victim to

296
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:20,880
that vulnerability because it was

297
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,380
sitting in software in a spot they

298
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,540
didn't know about now we can argue all

299
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,820
day and I know their CEO their ciso got

300
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,399
blasted for the response to this and

301
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:31,740
let's not get into those details

302
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,459
but

303
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,079
this happens every day

304
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:40,079
it's going to happen in any organization

305
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,300
in this case it affected 164 million

306
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,360
consumers data is exposed because well

307
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,100
we missed one

308
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,200
that struts library was sitting off over

309
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,579
here it was vulnerable we didn't know it

310
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:52,500
was in this system that system gave them

311
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,120
access they were able to Pivot blah blah

312
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,680
blah the usual story

313
00:11:57,959 --> 00:11:59,640
but we've got a really cool more recent

314
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,360
examples don't we

315
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,399
yeah that logging platform I was talking

316
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:08,940
about oh yes long for Jay how many of us

317
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,200
dealt with log 4J and that

318
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,339
excitement we'll call it excitement

319
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:16,920
because we want to be positive this is

320
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,600
our happy little con we're doing

321
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,339
Saturday morning cartoons we're going to

322
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:23,339
be positive well yeah we understand that

323
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:24,959
turned into a vulnerability a pretty

324
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,200
massive one it turns out that log 4J

325
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,019
it got used all over the place and well

326
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:32,880
we found one CD then they found another

327
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,980
then they found another

328
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,740
and these were big time this was super

329
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,980
easy remote code execution vulnerability

330
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,959
is easy to exploit and they were all

331
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,779
over the place why because 91 of java

332
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:49,079
applications use that Library

333
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:52,139
what's more interesting is that 61 of

334
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:52,860
those

335
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,139
are indirect dependencies these are

336
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:57,000
those dependencies where it's buried not

337
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,660
in it's not that your software says hey

338
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,120
I'm including this in my manifest and I

339
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,800
want my package manager to bring that in

340
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,060
no no no no 61 of those were somewhere

341
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,040
in a package that was being pulled in

342
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,700
Long 4J was buried

343
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,899
maybe multiple levels nested deep

344
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:22,500
this is the complexity of Open Source

345
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,820
and of course it didn't stop there

346
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,740
because then you know spring had to get

347
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,300
in on the ACT too and it was only a few

348
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,220
months later and and of course we had to

349
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,779
we had to give this one a cool name too

350
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:32,880
on your spring for Shell they decided to

351
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,200
college because we're not really

352
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,519
original either when we find

353
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,500
vulnerabilities apparently

354
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,200
but again multiple cves

355
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,680
so we just come off of Vlog 4J and now

356
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,940
we're scrambling again trying to figure

357
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,579
out where do we have spring now it

358
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:49,440
turned out this one wasn't nearly as

359
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,779
nasty as the log 4J vulnerability

360
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:54,120
although it was still pretty bad

361
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,160
um but again

362
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,920
a lot of times this stuff exists in your

363
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,779
software and you don't know it

364
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:02,459
you might be pulling this in from

365
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:03,959
another open source Library you can be

366
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:05,399
pulling these dependencies in through

367
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:07,440
even third-party software that you've

368
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,579
purchased

369
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:10,680
because they happen to have it your

370
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,779
third party purchase software may have

371
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:16,680
these things so what do we do about it

372
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,180
well there's an initiative about

373
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,820
initiative out there that has been going

374
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,980
for some time a colleague of mine Josh

375
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,440
Corman if you've ever met him is out

376
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,079
there championing this to all ends of

377
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,360
the Earth and I happen to agree with

378
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,040
much of what he's saying that's the idea

379
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,160
of the software bill of materials what

380
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,339
if we could create a list just like we

381
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:41,760
use an aircraft that says hey here is

382
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,920
everything that goes into my software

383
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,139
these are all the components that

384
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:49,860
comprise my software this is what I have

385
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,560
approved to have in my software I know

386
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,240
this is what's there I can say

387
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,380
definitively that this is my code base

388
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,440
and this is what it includes well that's

389
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,139
going so well that in uh was it may of

390
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:06,600
2021

391
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,880
it was an executive order

392
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,380
says hey

393
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,480
if you're doing business with a

394
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,940
government agency and you're selling a

395
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,860
software you now have to supply us with

396
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,959
an s-bomb

397
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,760
and there's lots of stuff out there on

398
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,380
what the format has to look like and

399
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,940
everything else of course they you know

400
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,199
the government being who they are they

401
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,639
work with Carnegie Mellon and they

402
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,800
created a whole bunch of stuff right now

403
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,300
I'm not suggesting that every

404
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,860
organization wants to create an s-bomb

405
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,300
of every piece of software you have

406
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,399
because when we start talking s-bombs

407
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:36,959
that gets pretty complex as I said

408
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,839
there's standard formats and things for

409
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:40,920
this that

410
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,779
generally when you work in that

411
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:45,720
Community they tend to be pretty heavy

412
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,160
weight and a little bit of owner a

413
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,800
little onerous but what if we could do

414
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,699
that same thing

415
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,579
so SDA is under the chat

416
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:59,100
software composition analysis

417
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,260
what is software composition analysis

418
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,540
well no one really knows because we

419
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,459
create all sorts of terms that we never

420
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:07,260
really know what they mean

421
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,240
but the general sense here is that

422
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,139
you've got a tool in most cases

423
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:16,079
doesn't have to be a tool but something

424
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,579
is going to go through your code look at

425
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:19,620
those dependencies walk that dependency

426
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,139
tree and identify all of those different

427
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:24,600
components that are now a part of your

428
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,720
software and create that inventory for

429
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,100
you

430
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,500
you can do it manually there are tools

431
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,480
and things like eclipse and others that

432
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,579
will give this to you and you might have

433
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:38,220
to do some more legwork

434
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,560
but there's also security focused tools

435
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,360
that are doing this one of them is right

436
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,100
outside the door here

437
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,899
okay

438
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:48,240
so there are tools that you can purchase

439
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,060
that will do this work for you

440
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,759
as I said there's different Utilities in

441
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,560
many of the IDS that will do this for

442
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,320
you but the point is starting to bring

443
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,759
to light that ability to understand

444
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:05,040
what's in your software

445
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,459
and so varying degrees and you'll see if

446
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:10,020
you talk to is like I actually just

447
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,339
spoke to the folks from shift left

448
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:13,260
earlier today because they're the ones

449
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,459
right out here

450
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:16,939
and I know sneak pretty well because

451
00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:20,280
spoiler alert I used to work there

452
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,380
um and they all look at it a little

453
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,760
different but at the end of the day it's

454
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,459
all focused on that same strategy so

455
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:28,679
when we start looking at how do we do

456
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:31,559
this it's great to know there's tooling

457
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:33,240
but then you sit here and you say well

458
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,059
great another security tool so I've got

459
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:39,299
my SAS tool got my gas tool I'm Doing

460
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:40,799
Network vulnerability scan I'm doing

461
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,059
penetration tests and now I'm going to

462
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:43,500
throw to something else at my developers

463
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,780
the nice thing about these tools is that

464
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,820
they are really developer focused and

465
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,320
that we'll talk about in a second why

466
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,660
that's important because one of the

467
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,280
other things you have to do going back

468
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,700
to the aircraft industry

469
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,419
remember I said we've got this wonderful

470
00:17:59,419 --> 00:18:04,140
cool you know list of all the equipment

471
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,419
well obviously over time you want to

472
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,980
replace that equipment

473
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,200
you don't want to keep I mean if I if

474
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,820
that plane that I bought had the radios

475
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,919
that were installed in it back in 1968

476
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,720
when it was brand new I don't think I'd

477
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,460
be really thrilled with it

478
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,340
so I replaced them but every time I

479
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,320
replace a piece of equipment what do I

480
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,820
need to do I need to update that

481
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,980
inventory and if I'm doing it on a

482
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,320
certificated airplane the FAA requires

483
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,520
me to fill out this form well actually

484
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,220
my mechanic or whoever installs it has

485
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,840
to fill out this form this is the FAA

486
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,539
form 30

487
00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:38,940
337 geez I can spit that out

488
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,919
and all it is is it's a detailed account

489
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:43,380
of what was removed what was added and

490
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,179
how was that certified to be inside that

491
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:47,480
plane

492
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,059
those SCA tools give us the same thing

493
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:55,440
and they build us into an idea of what

494
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,620
I consider true devsecops

495
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:02,880
and that is where security is a

496
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,400
component in my

497
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,799
in My overall pipeline

498
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:11,100
but it's not a separate thing we love to

499
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,100
look at security when we talk devops we

500
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,840
love to look at security and bringing

501
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,179
security into that in terms of you know

502
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:20,100
you'll see talks on this well we need to

503
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,559
install these quality Gates

504
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,500
no we need to get away from quality

505
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,700
Gates

506
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,320
quality gates are the thing that break

507
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,539
our pipeline right quality games are the

508
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:32,220
thing that say Hey this pipeline is

509
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,919
supposed to flow from here to here in a

510
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:36,720
linear Direction just go one way and

511
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,640
then it repeats over and over again so

512
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,900
you can say it's linear you can say it's

513
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,059
a Infinity diagram I really don't care

514
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:44,340
but it's supposed to flow One Direction

515
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,440
the minute I stick a quality gate in

516
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,500
there between build and test

517
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,120
I have the potential to break that

518
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,980
pipeline because I may get to that

519
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,480
quality gate and say nope you got to go

520
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,919
back to code

521
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,860
well now my pipeline's going backward

522
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,740
so when we think about what SCA does

523
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,539
the way that these especially when we

524
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:05,100
look at these tools the way that they

525
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,960
work is they're going to look at yes

526
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,700
there's a scan there's a scan that

527
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,860
happens

528
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,720
it happens one time I've got my

529
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,940
inventory now maybe it happens each time

530
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,820
I build but a lot of these tools are

531
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,220
built into their pipeline tools so

532
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,080
they're sitting in your repositories

533
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,059
they're sitting in your build tools

534
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:26,280
they're sitting in your CI tools and yes

535
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,559
they are constantly active but the cool

536
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,120
thing is when you have that inventory

537
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,160
the other piece that they give you is

538
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,780
that monitoring so that when something

539
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,160
changes

540
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,160
maybe you didn't change your code at all

541
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,780
what's our solution for that with us

542
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,580
with SAS today

543
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,799
if I have a piece of code that hasn't

544
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:45,660
had any development done on it in 90

545
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,860
days

546
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,140
either my view of the vulnerabilities in

547
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,360
it are 90 days old because that was last

548
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,460
time I ran a scan or I got to have some

549
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,860
policy that says hey if you go so long

550
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,600
without scanning your code you have to

551
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,220
scan it again

552
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,500
well with SCA what you get is you've got

553
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,120
an inventory and now you can monitor

554
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,320
that inventory for new known

555
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,480
vulnerabilities you can get that

556
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,880
proactive alert to say all right I need

557
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,160
to go back and fix this so when

558
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,039
something changes it's documented you've

559
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,200
got that visibility

560
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,559
so now when the next log for Shell or

561
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:22,260
whatever Goofy name we come up with for

562
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,240
the next one comes out instead of

563
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,400
sitting there wondering

564
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,260
you know hmm I wonder if this is

565
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,880
vulnerable now

566
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,080
we know

567
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,820
we know because we have an inventory we

568
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,080
have a tool that's monitoring we have a

569
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,000
tool that's letting us know hey you know

570
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,620
what we saw this in your environment

571
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,820
you're going to need to know about it

572
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,039
well that sounds pretty cool so now

573
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,960
instant response sensors the chat right

574
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:47,760
because in the airplane

575
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,100
world when we have something like this

576
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,220
come up like I know you may not

577
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,720
understand the term but the angle of

578
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,020
attack indicator or well instruments and

579
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:04,380
on a 737 Max 8 are problematic

580
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,360
the FAA goes and they issue an emergency

581
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,640
or worthiness directive that says you

582
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,500
got to fix this or you got to ground

583
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,419
your airplane

584
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:14,220
and that happens with little planes like

585
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,559
mine in fact my specific airplane

586
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,720
there's one in particular about wings

587
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,940
falling off or you know little things

588
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:21,900
like that

589
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,179
little things they're not I mean you

590
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:26,039
know they're not that important you got

591
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:27,120
two of them

592
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,460
so

593
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,500
wheels are good too but the wheels are

594
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,760
attached to the Wing So if you lose the

595
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,860
wing you lost the wheel too

596
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,200
um but seriously that is that's a

597
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,059
legitimate airworthy instructive for my

598
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:41,940
aircraft is about an issue with wing

599
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,640
spars that causes fatigue cracks long

600
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,500
story

601
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:50,520
but imagine being able to do this now

602
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:54,659
when you've got something like log4j

603
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:56,039
where there's a log for shelf

604
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:58,380
vulnerability and it pops up think about

605
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,840
what it would be like as you're sitting

606
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,400
there how many of you

607
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,200
when logged four shells there are a

608
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,640
bunch of you that raised your hand you

609
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,140
got to deal with this how many of you

610
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,480
knew right away where all of your

611
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,240
instances of log Force log for J were

612
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,500
I one hand

613
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:19,500
yes because what if you had a tool that

614
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,419
gave you this

615
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:23,580
so this is one of my favorite stories

616
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,980
from when I dealt with it which was at

617
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,919
that former employer where we actually

618
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:31,320
leveraged one of the I won't tell you

619
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,059
which but one of those logos I put up

620
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:35,880
there before and we were using it in our

621
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,400
devops pipeline so when log4 shell came

622
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,299
up

623
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:42,559
within hours

624
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:45,600
I had a complete inventory of 953

625
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,820
locations in all of my software where we

626
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,940
had a log 4J dependency and I can tell

627
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,100
you A lot of them probably close to that

628
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,380
number from sneak that said 61 it was

629
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,299
somewhere in that ballpark of our

630
00:23:57,299 --> 00:23:59,159
indirect depend of ours were indirect

631
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:01,380
dependencies

632
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,240
so think about the magic of that for

633
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,620
your instant response team when you can

634
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,940
go into something like that and you say

635
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,559
yeah we already know where all of it is

636
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:09,720
we can already start figuring out how we

637
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,400
Implement mitigations how are we going

638
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,520
to uh you know fix our own code how are

639
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,659
we going to reach out to a particular

640
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:17,940
vendor who's got to fix theirs how do we

641
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,039
prioritize these

642
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:22,559
that information was all there within

643
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,620
hours

644
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:27,539
within two weeks we had this completely

645
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:30,720
remediated I'm talking to cso peers of

646
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,000
mine who were still trying to figure out

647
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,400
where they had it

648
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,600
I think we're still trying to build

649
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,820
inventories of this

650
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:42,059
so that's where the value of SCA starts

651
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:43,860
to come in is okay yeah I can actually

652
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,679
understand this and I can gain that

653
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:49,200
visibility and now I've got that catalog

654
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,120
you mentioned that you've got s-bombs in

655
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,340
your organization

656
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:56,159
and this is what it does for you

657
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,740
so think about that that's awesome but

658
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,480
you know what incident response isn't

659
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,159
the only place

660
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,140
because guess who else wants in on this

661
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:07,080
conversation your compliance team but

662
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,700
then you know when compliance oh yeah

663
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,280
well you know compliance gets involved

664
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,260
goodbye

665
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,419
you know all right

666
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:17,520
but no seriously compliance wants to be

667
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,299
there

668
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:20,280
because what can we do with this from a

669
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,659
compliance perspective well there's a

670
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:23,760
couple really cool things

671
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,520
so when I think about again sticking

672
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,020
with my metaphor from the aviation

673
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:31,980
Community for one slide longer

674
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,679
for those of you that don't know the FAA

675
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:38,279
the NTSB and even NASA get together and

676
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:40,860
spend a lot of time and effort

677
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,100
finding Lessons Learned

678
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,659
measuring every statistic they can get

679
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:48,360
their hands on now I've for those in

680
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,740
here that are in the aviation Community

681
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,720
yes we can argue about how good they are

682
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,640
at that but

683
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,919
the intent is kind of there right

684
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,840
they're collecting tons of data and they

685
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,240
make this data available because the

686
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,659
focus is they want people to learn from

687
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:06,779
this so data on crashes you can go out

688
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:08,760
there you can read the reports from

689
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,380
these things are public

690
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,120
yeah you can argue again about the

691
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,620
qualities Sometimes some of the

692
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,779
information especially when it's a small

693
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:18,480
general aviation aircraft that crashes

694
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,480
versus a nice big airliner they tend to

695
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,740
care a little bit more when you know

696
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:25,559
hundreds of people die versus two

697
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:28,260
um but the data's there

698
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,299
so compliance wants that too compliance

699
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:31,679
wants to be able to look at it and say

700
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,840
all right how are we doing

701
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,640
are we getting better how are we

702
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,620
responding to these things where are we

703
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,179
seeing vulnerabilities

704
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:41,220
so just the metrics alone that you get

705
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,600
out of having a tool like this and being

706
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,460
able to understand all right here's

707
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,260
where we're seeing our issues here's

708
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:49,559
what we're seeing most of that common

709
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:50,940
activity around different

710
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,620
vulnerabilities that are showing up we

711
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:55,080
can start to understand maybe there are

712
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,779
components within our our software

713
00:26:57,779 --> 00:26:58,980
packages that we're pulling from the

714
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,779
open source community that are ones that

715
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:03,179
we don't really want to keep as a part

716
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:04,440
of our software

717
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,000
because again you're dealing with open

718
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,580
source maintainers some of them have all

719
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,720
the time in the world and they're big

720
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,220
groups and they can spend a ton of time

721
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,440
on this a lot of packages out there are

722
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,000
maintained by one or two people who

723
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,039
maybe don't have the time to sit there

724
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,200
and review every poll request to make

725
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,419
sure that it's completely secure and so

726
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:23,159
you as an organization may want to make

727
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:25,980
a decision about do we keep including

728
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,840
that particular package or should we

729
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,720
look at something else or here's a novel

730
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,460
idea and this is the one that makes the

731
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,740
legal team and the financial team freak

732
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:38,400
out but maybe we start contributing back

733
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,500
to that project

734
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,779
maybe we

735
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:45,360
as form of payments since we're getting

736
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,860
all this free code

737
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,260
maybe our commitment should be to making

738
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,659
that code better some organizations some

739
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:53,159
of the bigger ones

740
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:56,120
are doing that

741
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,440
that's not the only thing compliance is

742
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,980
interested in think about this so if I

743
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,500
am pulling source code

744
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,539
from

745
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:08,820
the open source Community let's say it's

746
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:12,059
licensed with Creative Commons

747
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:15,720
what potential issue does that have

748
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,460
there's a few

749
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,860
one am I even licensed

750
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,779
am I even licensed to have these

751
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:24,299
components in my software am I using it

752
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:25,980
in a way that is consistent with their

753
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,840
license

754
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,179
so just that General licensing

755
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:32,340
discussion can be really important for

756
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,200
your compliance team

757
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,720
but let's think about in terms of IP for

758
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,419
a moment intellectual property

759
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:41,640
what is Creative Commons in most of the

760
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,159
iterations of their different licenses

761
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,059
require

762
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,400
think like share and share a like

763
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:55,140
so if I attribution as well yes in fact

764
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,340
that's actually an interesting challenge

765
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,080
too

766
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,640
um but think about the share and share

767
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,500
like for a minute so

768
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,240
Sharon chair like basically says that

769
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,159
well if I'm going to use your open

770
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:06,659
source software now anything that I

771
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:10,159
included in becomes open source too

772
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:12,659
your legal team may have an issue with

773
00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:14,900
that

774
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:17,220
your product teams may have an issue

775
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,659
with that

776
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:20,279
those are things you want to know about

777
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:22,200
and so here again having that catalog

778
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,760
and being able to understand what is in

779
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,620
your software yeah this extends Way

780
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,480
Beyond security now because we're we're

781
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,919
talking about compliance things and

782
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:31,140
Licensing

783
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,880
that that's not really a cyber security

784
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,600
thing anymore

785
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:38,399
but hopefully what you're starting to

786
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,140
think and you're starting to see as I

787
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,059
start to tie into these other teams is

788
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:44,880
oh wait

789
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,620
maybe there's more people than just the

790
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,120
cyber security team that want to see

791
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,959
this tool in use

792
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:55,879
maybe even your customers care

793
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:57,779
you may not be doing business with the

794
00:29:57,779 --> 00:29:59,640
federal government today

795
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,679
but what happens when you get that big

796
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,720
financial services customer

797
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,700
that Global Behemoth who comes to you

798
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,320
and says hey

799
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,059
we want you to supply us with an

800
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:11,100
inventory of all the open source in your

801
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,419
software

802
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:14,580
or at minimum they say we want to know

803
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,200
we want to have validation that you're

804
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,299
monitoring that

805
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:19,919
this is when you have things like

806
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,899
s-bombs now that are being mandated by

807
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:22,919
the federal government this is where

808
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:24,240
we're headed

809
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,159
so getting ahead of that and having the

810
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,020
capability whether you buy one of those

811
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,120
commercial tools or you find ways to do

812
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,419
it yourself software composition

813
00:30:32,419 --> 00:30:36,120
analysis is important it carries

814
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,340
business value and that's the thing

815
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,299
that's going to be most important

816
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:41,039
because at the end of the day if you

817
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,179
want to introduce this to your

818
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:44,820
environment what do you need to do

819
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,260
you're going to need a solid business

820
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,779
case and you're going to need buy-in

821
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:50,880
from a lot of people because you've got

822
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,620
a lot of stakeholders who are going to

823
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,480
be involved in this who you are asking

824
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,820
to be a part of this program you're

825
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,980
talking about changing

826
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,620
that development pipeline you're talking

827
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,720
about getting your developers

828
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,580
involved in this in a way where they may

829
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,200
have to modify how they develop their

830
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,659
software they may need to be more aware

831
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:12,120
of what is in those packages so how do

832
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,360
you go about presenting this how do you

833
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,340
bring this to those people in a way

834
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,559
that's going to win

835
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:20,820
because

836
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,100
like it or not that is our job as cyber

837
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,779
Security Professionals we are not here

838
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:27,600
just to say this is bad fix it

839
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,659
we are here to educate and to influence

840
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:35,279
because when I go and I go to my CIO I

841
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:38,039
go to my CFO I go before the board and I

842
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:40,140
say you know what I want two million

843
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:43,200
dollars to do this thing it is my job to

844
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,360
be able to convince them why they want

845
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,399
to spend two million dollars on that

846
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:49,580
thing

847
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:53,340
so let's talk about how we do that

848
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,899
first of all

849
00:31:54,899 --> 00:31:56,760
you have got to show the value to the

850
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,940
business

851
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,740
and if you are thinking in your head

852
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,600
right now and I know this blows people's

853
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,940
minds when I say this if you're thinking

854
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,760
in your head that idea of risk

855
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,760
management and that the language of

856
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,520
business is risk and wolf is laughing

857
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,140
because he's heard me say this a hundred

858
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:18,779
times before the language of business is

859
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:21,360
not risk

860
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,940
I cannot scream it loud enough the

861
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,340
language of business is show me the

862
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,260
money

863
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,299
businesses are in business to make money

864
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:31,740
in most cases

865
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,299
a few exceptions to that yes I

866
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:34,799
understand non-profit Community the

867
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,559
government mission's a little different

868
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,840
even well you can argue both ways in

869
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,820
education but let's not get into that

870
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,500
conversation

871
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:47,580
um but the reality is risk management is

872
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:50,159
not why businesses exist and in fact

873
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,980
consider this for a brief moment

874
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,919
if a business is in business today

875
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:58,740
there is inherent risk in being in

876
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,520
business

877
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,559
just owning a business any of you who

878
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:03,779
have started your own business you

879
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:06,899
understand like me that there is risk

880
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:09,419
and a risk conversation that goes on in

881
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:12,480
your head about should I do this or not

882
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,100
so at the point that you've decided to

883
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,600
be in business you've already accepted

884
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,059
that risk you've already said that being

885
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:19,260
in business

886
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,779
is worth whatever risk I'm taking in

887
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:23,640
order to try to make money and get my

888
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,380
thing into there or to take on whatever

889
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,019
Mission it is if I'm in a non-profit

890
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:30,539
where mission is my driving Factor

891
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:33,179
or the government where in theory

892
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:36,620
mission is the driving Factor

893
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:40,080
so if I come to you and I say

894
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,019
hey I'm cyber security and I am all

895
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:45,840
about reducing your risk how sexy is

896
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,080
that here bored or already accepted that

897
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,360
risk what do I care I mean yes they do

898
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,880
care don't get me wrong board is there

899
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,380
they have a fiduciary responsibility

900
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,580
they're there to make sure the business

901
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,500
stays successful that stock prices keep

902
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,919
going up and shareholders stay happy and

903
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,700
that's what they do I get that but

904
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,080
at the end of the day they're there to

905
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,020
make sure the business makes money

906
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,719
risk is a factor in that but it is not

907
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,899
the only Factor so come ready to talk

908
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:22,219
about how SCA has business value

909
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:25,800
as I said you want this to be part of

910
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,418
your pipeline it needs to be part of the

911
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:28,739
pipeline because what you don't want

912
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:32,219
this to be is that tool that creates new

913
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:35,040
friction because friction

914
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,739
in your development process quality

915
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:40,739
Gates that stop your pipeline

916
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:43,679
just like an oil pipeline if you stop

917
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,460
the pipeline that's bad okay that's bad

918
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,339
that's the antithesis of business value

919
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:53,040
that is a business blocker you as a

920
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,659
cyber security professional are not

921
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,699
enabling the business if you are

922
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:58,260
introducing quality Gates and things

923
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,520
like that that are going to stop

924
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,619
development

925
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:03,300
so how do you work with this differently

926
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,220
how do you bring these tools into the

927
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,380
pipeline so that they happen inherently

928
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,119
with the pipeline how do you get your

929
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,859
pipeline so mature that you know what

930
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:13,020
scary thought you can go to production

931
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,760
with known vulnerability in your

932
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,740
software because hey I know my pipeline

933
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,540
is mature enough that the next cycle is

934
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,560
going to pick it up and it's going to

935
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,839
have it fixed in three hours or maybe a

936
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,180
day or two and I can launch a mitigation

937
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,619
in the meantime maybe we've got great

938
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:27,000
wafts in place I don't know pick your

939
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,160
mitigation the choice or multiple

940
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,599
mitigations please

941
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:32,880
but at the end of the day

942
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,760
getting in there without friction so

943
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,220
when I've got a cool tool that plugs in

944
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:42,960
to my repos and GitHub or in Ado or

945
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,900
wherever I'm keeping my software

946
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,599
when I've got that ability to tie it

947
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:50,880
into my CI tools into my build tools

948
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,160
when all of those capabilities are

949
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,680
intertwined that's where the value of

950
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,420
devops automation comes into play

951
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,640
Because by the way devops is not just

952
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:03,119
about automation okay that's a talk for

953
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,940
a different time though well so getting

954
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,619
tied into the pipeline and keeping that

955
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:10,020
pipeline in motion and more importantly

956
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,339
if you really want to drive business

957
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:13,560
value and demonstrate this show them how

958
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,540
this is going to speed up the

959
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,760
development pipeline

960
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,500
what are the things that are happening

961
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,780
today talk to your developers and find

962
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,880
out how annoying it is for them when

963
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,320
they don't know all the dependencies

964
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,839
that sit behind a particular component

965
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:29,880
in their software and now they find out

966
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,380
that hey there's something in there

967
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,359
that's five or leases old that's buried

968
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,520
three levels deep in a dependency

969
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,560
somewhere that's causing all sorts of

970
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,500
backward compatibility issues hey I can

971
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,760
give you a tool that not only is going

972
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,680
to help us make your software more

973
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,240
secure but it's going to help you find

974
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,820
stuff like that a whole lot easier too

975
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,940
oh business value making the pipeline

976
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,320
faster

977
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,960
that speaks to people you mean I can get

978
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,700
product out the door faster I can get

979
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,380
new feature functionality to my

980
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,720
customers faster

981
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,980
that makes people listen

982
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,000
we also need to start changing the

983
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,800
conversation overall

984
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,200
you know it's funny I I started this new

985
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,140
position eight weeks ago

986
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,720
into a conversation with my CEO I think

987
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,420
my second week and

988
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,720
we were chit chatting and they had had a

989
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,760
major breach a couple years ago and he

990
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,900
says to me

991
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,339
just don't let us get breached again

992
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,079
okay

993
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:34,640
um let's talk about that for a minute

994
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,500
now we can all in this room sit here and

995
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,880
say well gee it's not if you get

996
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,980
breached but when

997
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,839
I know this in the back of my head but

998
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:45,780
why is my CEO saying that to me

999
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,579
because it was freaking painful when we

1000
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:48,960
got breached

1001
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,460
but I know that we're going to get

1002
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,619
breached again I know that's going to

1003
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:54,420
happen because the laws of averages say

1004
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,200
so

1005
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,700
I know for sure I'm not going to

1006
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,740
guarantee him that I won't then I'll

1007
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,900
stop all breaches

1008
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,880
but what are we there to do we're there

1009
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,460
to slow down we're there to be resilient

1010
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,260
we're there to create that resiliency

1011
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,599
we're seeing this as a trend in the

1012
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,040
industry right now the focus on that

1013
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,900
word resiliency

1014
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,820
and that's the conversation we need to

1015
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,140
be driving

1016
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,820
so when I think about this in terms of

1017
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,079
SCA is this going to stop all

1018
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:21,359
vulnerabilities no is it going to stop

1019
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:25,140
me from getting breached probably not

1020
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,579
this is not the thing that's going to

1021
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:28,800
prevent all breaches if that product

1022
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,660
comes along I will be the first to let

1023
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,400
you know

1024
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,839
I'm sure there are some vendors who will

1025
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:35,400
claim they have it but trust me they

1026
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,520
don't

1027
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,720
but the reality is when we have these

1028
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,800
conversations if I'm going to go in

1029
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,060
there and I'm talking about SCA what I'm

1030
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,079
talking about is how do we get

1031
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:45,119
incrementally better how do I start a

1032
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,339
program of continuous Improvement where

1033
00:38:47,339 --> 00:38:49,680
I am going to make our software more and

1034
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:54,060
more secure day over day year over year

1035
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:57,359
because now I'm starting to shift the

1036
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,520
expectations when the expectations are

1037
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,540
I'm going to install this thing and

1038
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,460
we're never going to get breached again

1039
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,200
I'm lying

1040
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,839
because how long did it take before log

1041
00:39:06,839 --> 00:39:09,240
4J became of cve versus when it was

1042
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,000
actually first discovered

1043
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,640
no one really has an answer for that

1044
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,560
we saw lots of activity before it was

1045
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,119
logged as a cve we know that

1046
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,260
but we don't know how long that's been

1047
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,780
known about we don't know where that's

1048
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,880
been leveraged

1049
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,560
so to sit there and say that this is the

1050
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,160
end-all be-all answer no but to focus on

1051
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,560
that story of how this is helping us

1052
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,900
understand our ever-evolving technology

1053
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,060
that's the key because I've also had

1054
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,859
board members ask me hey when are we

1055
00:39:40,859 --> 00:39:42,960
done with having to you know invest in

1056
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,040
cyber security like this

1057
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:50,099
uh when technology stops changing right

1058
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:53,339
so let's change that conversation and

1059
00:39:53,339 --> 00:39:54,720
make that focus when we're talking about

1060
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,520
SCA or any other Initiative for that

1061
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:00,720
matter it's all about our ability to be

1062
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,540
resilient and what we're trying to do is

1063
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,520
we're trying to strengthen our defenses

1064
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,400
not look for perfection

1065
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,980
because Perfection is the thing that is

1066
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:13,079
unattainable that is the thing when

1067
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:14,400
we've got people out there talking about

1068
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,119
be breachless install our product

1069
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:20,040
I don't even know what that means

1070
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:25,160
be breachless that was a cute one I saw

1071
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,640
we're trying to get stronger we're

1072
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,660
trying to get more resilient we're

1073
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:30,900
trying to make our defenses such that we

1074
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,940
are a real pain in the ass to try to

1075
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:33,900
breach

1076
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,000
that's what I want

1077
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,339
you know what I want to be a tough nut

1078
00:40:38,339 --> 00:40:41,820
to crack am I crackable probably I don't

1079
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,440
think I will never stand up here and say

1080
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,880
that I can never build an organization

1081
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,359
that isn't going to be

1082
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:49,619
but

1083
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:51,960
focusing the conversation on making our

1084
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,880
defenses stronger here's how it's going

1085
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,400
to make us stronger not just in terms of

1086
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,440
hey we're stronger from a cyber security

1087
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,680
perspective but we are strengthening our

1088
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,200
compliance we're strengthening our

1089
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,060
ability to react

1090
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,740
we're strengthening the entire

1091
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,599
organization

1092
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,800
through the use of something like this

1093
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,119
and that's where we need to start to

1094
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,460
again have a very different conversation

1095
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,980
than what we've typically done you go in

1096
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,240
front of a board and you say hey this is

1097
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,619
the end-all BL Solution that's going to

1098
00:41:22,619 --> 00:41:24,660
make all our software secure

1099
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,820
it doesn't fly

1100
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,760
this is a tool that hey you know what I

1101
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,960
talked to compliance you know what

1102
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,099
they're on board because they say this

1103
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:33,420
is going to strengthen our compliance

1104
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,740
program as well they're going to we're

1105
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,000
going to understand our licensing better

1106
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,680
we're going to have better metrics we're

1107
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,480
going to be able to understand you know

1108
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,339
what third parties we're leveraging and

1109
00:41:41,339 --> 00:41:42,839
how good a job they're doing and all of

1110
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:44,760
these things great okay we can start to

1111
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,980
understand that better

1112
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,599
this is going to make our pipelines

1113
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:50,040
stronger and faster because hey it's

1114
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,660
given us this ability to see in you know

1115
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,040
the developers have told me this is all

1116
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,480
the problems they're having and I've

1117
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,859
I've got a solution that's going to help

1118
00:41:55,859 --> 00:41:58,140
them think about when you start to draw

1119
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,940
that picture of how your initiative

1120
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:03,720
affects all those other areas positively

1121
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,920
especially when you get those other

1122
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,720
areas to come in and say yeah you know

1123
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,359
we support this and we want it too

1124
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:11,400
getting your stakeholders on board to

1125
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,660
say

1126
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,339
we're looking for Extra Strength here

1127
00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:17,700
this is going to bring it to us

1128
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,619
and then finally

1129
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:21,780
I said it

1130
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:24,060
risk is not the language of business if

1131
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,560
you want to find the Holy Grail when you

1132
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,180
are trying to sell an initiative to your

1133
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,079
board

1134
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:29,700
tell them how this is going to make them

1135
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,859
more money well how do I make more money

1136
00:42:31,859 --> 00:42:34,700
with SCA

1137
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,560
thoughts

1138
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,380
let's start with that s-bomb idea

1139
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:42,480
how many organizations are asking you

1140
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,579
right now about

1141
00:42:44,579 --> 00:42:46,740
you know your software

1142
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:49,680
how many of them are saying hey we want

1143
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,119
to understand what you're doing to

1144
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:52,200
secure it

1145
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,820
when you can show them that you're on

1146
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,200
the Leading Edge and hey you know what

1147
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,359
this is something we do we're able to

1148
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:59,579
understand everything that's in our

1149
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:00,720
software we're able to provide you

1150
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,940
immediate alerts when there's a new CD

1151
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:04,859
that comes out as to in the open source

1152
00:43:04,859 --> 00:43:06,180
Community as to whether or not that's

1153
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:08,280
part of our software we're able to

1154
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,900
provide you that better visibility and

1155
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,940
capability and we have the strength and

1156
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:14,700
the processes in place to address those

1157
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,280
immediately those conversations happen

1158
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,500
easier

1159
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,960
because what happens when you're talking

1160
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:25,079
to say a gigantic

1161
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:27,060
multinational

1162
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:29,220
who wants to understand your cyber

1163
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:31,380
security program and you can show them

1164
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,180
that you're doing something that is

1165
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:36,420
proactive ahead of the game ahead of

1166
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:39,000
what most people are doing today

1167
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,540
they don't ask as many questions

1168
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,400
because now they start to see oh okay

1169
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,200
they're doing like you know kind of

1170
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,960
Leading Edge stuff we're on board with

1171
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:49,920
this

1172
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,859
so that's that's a

1173
00:43:52,859 --> 00:43:56,640
maybe less tangible but really specific

1174
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,280
way to talk about how this really builds

1175
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,380
your business development

1176
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:04,079
how this starts to make money for the

1177
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:06,300
organization now depending

1178
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:09,240
on who you are and and the nature of

1179
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,319
your business there might be other ways

1180
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:11,520
that you can actually turn this into a

1181
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,440
revenue generator

1182
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,240
think about this for a minute how could

1183
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,839
you take that software inventory that

1184
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:20,040
you have that talks about everything

1185
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,260
that's in your software depending on

1186
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,940
what you're selling depending on what

1187
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:26,160
you're providing

1188
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,020
what if there's that opportunity to even

1189
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:30,420
sell that alone as a capability to your

1190
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:31,380
customers

1191
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:34,020
that they now have that visibility that

1192
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,460
they now have that capability or they

1193
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:38,160
can leverage that in some way

1194
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,839
when we start to think about our

1195
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:41,460
security initiatives that way in general

1196
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:44,280
whether it's SCA or anything else this

1197
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,720
is where we really start to find

1198
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,579
traction with the board with the

1199
00:44:47,579 --> 00:44:49,140
executives and so on

1200
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:51,839
so be on the lookout for those talk with

1201
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,420
your business teams talk with your

1202
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:56,520
product teams understand what they're

1203
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,140
doing and say Hey I want to bring this

1204
00:44:58,140 --> 00:44:59,819
new thing

1205
00:44:59,819 --> 00:45:02,160
where can we maybe look to leverage this

1206
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,520
into a revenue opportunity how can we

1207
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,280
sell an additional layer of service that

1208
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,740
includes this sta visibility or

1209
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:13,260
capability or some offshoot of what it

1210
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:15,780
provides us look for those elements and

1211
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:17,339
bring that to the table

1212
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:18,960
don't come in there and say this is

1213
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,220
going to remove all these

1214
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:23,400
vulnerabilities from our developed code

1215
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,020
that's part of the story but that's like

1216
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:26,640
this tiny little bit and it's not a very

1217
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,980
sexy tiny little bit it doesn't get

1218
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:30,960
people listening think about the things

1219
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,720
that are going to get people listening

1220
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:36,599
filled a competitive Advantage because

1221
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:38,460
that's what people want

1222
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:40,319
maybe this is the thing you point to

1223
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:42,119
it's part of a comprehensive cyber

1224
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:44,040
security program that puts us ahead of

1225
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,480
our competitors however you want to

1226
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,740
Market this

1227
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:49,560
make it something that becomes a

1228
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,079
championing thing for your organization

1229
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:55,040
in your Marketplace

1230
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:58,619
leave you with a quote as I wrap up here

1231
00:45:58,619 --> 00:46:00,359
Perfection yeah it's the enemy of

1232
00:46:00,359 --> 00:46:02,099
progress if we're out there chasing

1233
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:03,119
Perfection we're never going to get

1234
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:04,380
there if we're out there selling

1235
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:06,540
Perfection and we're telling our

1236
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:07,680
organizations that we can deliver

1237
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,780
Perfection we're not going to be making

1238
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:12,000
progress because you're not going to

1239
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,339
lack credibility you're not going to be

1240
00:46:14,339 --> 00:46:17,460
successful in that end and at the end of

1241
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,260
the day that's going to hinder your

1242
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:20,400
