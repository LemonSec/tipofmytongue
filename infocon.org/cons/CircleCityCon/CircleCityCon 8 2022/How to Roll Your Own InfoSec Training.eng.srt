[Music]

2
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,000
and away we go

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,240
all right

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,039
uh

5
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,199
thank you everybody for

6
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,880
coming to

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,480
uh this talk

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,720
uh which is my first mistake was wanting

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,800
to teach or

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,399
how to roll your own infosec training

11
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,520
this is going to go a little bit into a

12
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,960
lot of things

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,879
that you probably never thought about

14
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,160
when

15
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,000
or if you are considering doing your own

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,960
training

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,160
um

18
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,718
i am

19
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,600
sean townsend uh i also go by mobius

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,000
online

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,879
and with me is the wonderful blind

22
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,760
hacker howdy joe b blind hacker

23
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,320
so i think we've got some uh objectives

24
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,799
and some uh some quick things that we're

25
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,159
we want to talk to you guys about during

26
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,720
this uh like you said this is uh

27
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,119
both mobius and my experience on um

28
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,799
making the mistake of wanting to teach

29
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,840
and and where we've gone um where we've

30
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,640
both diverged but ultimately have done a

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,040
lot of the similar research

32
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,400
um on uh

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,840
on how to do this and it's going to

34
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,000
cover things such as papers please where

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,680
we talk about uh businesses and

36
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,200
licensing

37
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,079
uh you know what uh what what this is

38
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,920
what the talk is about uh business

39
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,520
branding uh

40
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,799
bits and boot

41
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,560
bits and bobs

42
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,920
uh

43
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,200
tech cash and other uh stacks

44
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,119
uh the environments that you gotta worry

45
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,240
about your recording setup and uh

46
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,159
teaching the teachers and then we'll

47
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,159
we'll wrap up

48
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,240
right on

49
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,840
so uh a little bit about us um i have

50
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,479
been doing malware analysis and reverse

51
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:05,920
engineering now for a little over five

52
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,960
years

53
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,360
um i am trying to grow myself in

54
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,360
in the infosec space as

55
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,599
uh you know somebody who does mentoring

56
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,920
and leadership because i feel like

57
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,120
there's not nearly enough leadership in

58
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,400
the space

59
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,560
and i really think that a change in that

60
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,879
would dramatically help

61
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,440
a lot of people

62
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,720
but i will

63
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,560
try to provide that on you know pretty

64
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,840
much any topic uh obviously my my main

65
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,920
focus is uh malware and malware

66
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,840
accessories but you know anything to

67
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,440
your to your liking

68
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,959
um i am a army vet military intelligence

69
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,080
i was in oaf three in baghdad back in

70
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,440
2005.

71
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,480
uh i

72
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,760
am the owner of mobius malware analysis

73
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,080
uh and i am a principal cyber

74
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,159
intelligence researcher at anomaly inc

75
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,280
uh i'm joby the blind hacker um i'm a

76
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,000
big mentor and that's what uh you know i

77
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,560
met mobius he came in and he started

78
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,159
learning and saying

79
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,840
uh some wild things that he wanted to

80
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,319
teach and uh ultimately uh

81
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,040
uh i guess i without being presumptuous

82
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,560
i guess i could say i'm the mentor's

83
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,680
mentor so if it all goes hardly right

84
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,879
blame me

85
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,040
um

86
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,080
uh as if you know me i do a lot of stuff

87
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,760
i'm a big advocate for

88
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,720
for jobs for yourself for education and

89
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,560
so when uh mobius approached me about

90
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,239
all these things this was uh like this

91
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,680
is our joint experience

92
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,440
um however uh i have a bit of a

93
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,200
fluttered background i am

94
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,519
uh i'm more of an offset guy these days

95
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,159
i've done defense in the past and um

96
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,560
with for the most part the uh

97
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,319
um

98
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,680
these days i'm uh

99
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,360
my job title is director of innovation

100
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,519
research and uh uh director of

101
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:00,959
innovation

102
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,360
uh she's research and advanced testing

103
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,680
at onto finn uh developing really cool

104
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,720
products out there if you guys are

105
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,360
interested in uh ransomware and uh

106
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,519
reversing malware you might uh you know

107
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,760
not really i make malware uh but it's

108
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,639
always worth a check out

109
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,040
rhino

110
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,000
all right so uh what does this talk

111
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,280
about essentially it's um creating your

112
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,919
your own training from the ground up

113
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,400
right a lot of there's a lot of

114
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,919
stuff out there in terms of courses and

115
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,960
and classes that you know somebody will

116
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,880
say okay we're going to go through the

117
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,600
entirety of this book or

118
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,320
you know we have a a college course that

119
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,759
we're going to go over and it's it's

120
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,240
pulled from a variety of things

121
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,360
um

122
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,560
but uh

123
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,919
my course is not structured off of

124
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:54,960
anything

125
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,440
formal beyond

126
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,919
my experience in the industry the things

127
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,320
that i had to learn the hard way uh

128
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,400
drinking from the fire hose pretty much

129
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,240
daily for years

130
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,680
um

131
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,720
and you know things that that aren't

132
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,240
really covered

133
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,880
so much in books uh or other classes

134
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,880
that i have taken

135
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,240
um

136
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,639
[Music]

137
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,160
i want to well we we want to you know

138
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,120
kind of

139
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,080
push that this is an awesome thing

140
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,639
just know that it is so much more work

141
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,120
than you think it's going to be it is so

142
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,199
much more work and because it's so much

143
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,160
more work uh blind here

144
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,880
advocates that you steal everything

145
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,680
not really in terms of content but

146
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,960
methods to make your life easier

147
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,400
and to

148
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,840
you know

149
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,360
if it's not broke don't fix it yeah kind

150
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,039
of a mentality when it when you're

151
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,160
looking at tools or layouts or or you

152
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,680
know things like that

153
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,840
and um you know just to talk about

154
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,840
things that uh that have been learned

155
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,680
over the last six months

156
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,160
um because i am currently about to wrap

157
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,160
up my second round of uh beta

158
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,080
uh i guess beta testing um with my my

159
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,520
second class

160
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,800
and uh

161
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,479
so there's there's been a lot of things

162
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,039
that have been covered

163
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:21,390
um

164
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,800
[Music]

165
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,319
you know on both of our ends so

166
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,319
yeah and uh i'll just to be very clear

167
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,919
when i say steal everything it's it's

168
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,600
one of those mantras of if there's a

169
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,440
methodology or if you see someone doing

170
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,479
it right there's no there's no point in

171
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,560
ultimately reinventing the wheel there's

172
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,160
a point of

173
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,560
of looking at how to do this and

174
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,360
following a blueprint a methodology and

175
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,440
and again

176
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,319
at your leisure take what is good uh

177
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,720
leave what is bad for the most part and

178
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,599
uh

179
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,039
well then we get to this part so this

180
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,639
was uh i remember you came to me and

181
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,280
asked me um hey i really want to teach

182
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,280
and and i looked at you and i said hey

183
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,960
well do you want to do you want it to be

184
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,639
a business or do you want to be a

185
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,639
teacher do you want to be a mentor what

186
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,000
do you want to do and you said well you

187
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,880
know be nice if i could uh make this a

188
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,800
second income if i could make some money

189
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,120
but you know get also still do my best

190
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,639
to give back i don't remember those were

191
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,479
your exact words but i remember that was

192
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,199
the

193
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,039
the gist of our

194
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,560
conversation there i was like well guess

195
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,599
what

196
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,560
i'm gonna need to start a business

197
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,360
yeah

198
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,720
it's it's it's pretty pretty uh close to

199
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,360
to what it is from what i remember um

200
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,360
yeah and uh

201
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,759
i i gotta tell you um for anybody that

202
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,800
has not done anything like this

203
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,000
setting up a business is the easiest

204
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,879
thing that you will do it is the easiest

205
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,280
thing it will take you 10 minutes

206
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,120
and about 150

207
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,840
yep that's it yes you got to fill out uh

208
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,400
there's a few forms on your states um

209
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,800
yeah sba.gov will do it uh i went

210
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,280
through like uh my state's department of

211
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,720
revenue i believe

212
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,319
or uh

213
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,759
one of the one of the

214
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,599
the the state run

215
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,280
um sites and you just have to

216
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,039
declare the name of your company what

217
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,440
you're going to do how many employees

218
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,160
and then pay a fee and that's it

219
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,479
uh it is by far the easiest thing that

220
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,479
you will do but it is also one of the

221
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,759
best things that you can do because

222
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,520
at that point you have some coverage

223
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,479
and it provides you a serious layer of

224
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,479
protection especially when you're

225
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,719
teaching

226
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,559
the things you can teach in our industry

227
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,080
right right

228
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,480
yeah it's and definitely when it comes

229
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,720
to

230
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,160
you know sometimes you will have

231
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,279
folks who won't listen and they may end

232
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,880
up harming their systems or somebody

233
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,880
else's system and and

234
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,040
so it's good to have some protection

235
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,120
there um

236
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,959
to an extent

237
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,120
it will protect your work although you

238
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,480
usually need something a little bit more

239
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,120
in-depth uh you know when it when it

240
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,600
comes to that um

241
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,760
if you are going to be charging you need

242
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,240
to be putting aside money for taxes

243
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,800
uh you because you can't just take in

244
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,440
income especially you know

245
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,560
i'm i'm still not even charging yet but

246
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,680
um

247
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,000
if you're going to be taking in

248
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,839
like i don't know

249
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,839
one of the larger organizations

250
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,680
thousands upon thousands of dollars per

251
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,800
course

252
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,279
uh the irs is going to notice

253
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,440
something is awry

254
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,279
and they like to go after little guys

255
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,800
much more than they like to go after

256
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,399
bigger guys so

257
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,959
um it's a really good thing to have that

258
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,000
set up for taxes and also your ability

259
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,600
to write things off because at the

260
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,680
outset and for a considerable amount of

261
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,120
time until you're bringing in income

262
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,720
you're going to be spending your own

263
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,880
money on this and you will be spending

264
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,640
much more than you think

265
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,680
all right

266
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,959
um

267
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,519
but yeah and then you know copyright and

268
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,279
uh and whatnot like that's a whole

269
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,120
separate issue but if you really want to

270
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,959
protect your work you want to copyright

271
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,200
it because there is a lot of

272
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,160
um

273
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,920
theft and you know things we'll we'll

274
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,279
talk about it a little bit um but

275
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,839
yeah there is something to look into

276
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,760
uh and it's something that you you might

277
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,680
not think about at the outset right

278
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,760
absolutely it's definitely you protect

279
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,320
yourself you protect your work and and

280
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,279
again

281
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,560
you're you're doing things right and

282
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,480
like you said when the irs notices if

283
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,959
money's coming in it's it's

284
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,560
it can be an adventure if you're not

285
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,640
doing it right and and they will quickly

286
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,399
inform you you are not doing it right

287
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,480
with with large amounts of fees and

288
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,600
fines

289
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,440
yeah that's that's not a uh

290
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,000
a fun endeavor to go through

291
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,240
so

292
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,959
you're going to start a company

293
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,720
awesome uh where do you start you don't

294
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,320
know

295
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,040
like

296
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,640
what do you want it to be what do you

297
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,040
want it to look like what do you want

298
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,800
your core audience to be um

299
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,600
you know what what is your aim and

300
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,200
overall goal

301
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,800
uh for me i wanted to

302
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,399
break out of my

303
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,800
imposter syndrome and

304
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,360
teach people because i i had a

305
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,839
realization that

306
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,920
i really wanted to teach somebody and it

307
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,720
was because i had had several folks over

308
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,079
the years

309
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,079
ask me if i could show them

310
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,240
what i did and then for one reason or

311
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,320
another they flaked out

312
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,560
and i was really bummed

313
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,320
like it was super disappointing that i

314
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,000
couldn't share because i don't ever

315
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,240
really get to talk about this stuff with

316
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,680
uh with people you know you get that

317
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,839
kind of deer in the headlights look and

318
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,839
nobody really gets it uh especially if

319
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,160
you're not in the infosec industry so

320
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,160
yeah

321
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,240
you know

322
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,760
really

323
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,720
figure out your aim first

324
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,600
to

325
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,839
some extent

326
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,000
it's going to cost a little bit of money

327
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,399
to get started with that

328
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,720
um but if you're on a budget you know

329
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,120
for things like logos and and kind of

330
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,800
basic design go on fiverr uh ask around

331
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,839
your friends see who's who's an artist

332
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,200
there are more than a few infosec uh

333
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,360
you know well-known infosec folks who do

334
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,360
artwork of one kind or another they will

335
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,760
do logo design they will do stickers

336
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,720
um you know it's really good to

337
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,760
um to make connections and ask around

338
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,839
which is uh one of the you know the

339
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,880
bottom point is to find a community of

340
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,800
of people that

341
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,079
have similar interests uh if you're not

342
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,720
already involved in one and

343
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,040
start talking about things

344
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,040
start talking about what you want to do

345
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,120
and what you want to build and

346
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,519
how you want it to look and i guarantee

347
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,399
you

348
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,920
they either can do it or they know

349
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,639
somebody who can't

350
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,720
i think that was the that was a big help

351
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,560
for for you it's a big help for me you

352
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,600
know

353
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,560
i built uh i built my brand uh several

354
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,720
years ago being the blind hacker

355
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,839
um i got a logo made i went to a

356
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,000
professional um i then built a you know

357
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,920
i started streaming i built a community

358
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,079
i was out there advertising for myself i

359
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,800
was going to dead slacks i was going to

360
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,720
uh you know other discords gamer

361
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,320
discords because when i was doing this

362
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,160
there wasn't really infosec discords i

363
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,440
was going to all these places and i was

364
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,279
like hey come check me out check me out

365
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,240
and and built a brand of of hey i'm

366
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,920
streaming all the time i'm giving out

367
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,399
cts i'm doing a bunch of offensive stuff

368
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,160
and then and then you know if you know

369
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,839
the story behind dead pixel within you

370
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,279
know six months i was like hey this is

371
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,560
no longer about me it's about this

372
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,399
community that's built up around me and

373
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,600
this is where the importance of

374
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
community comes from where i said hey

375
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,360
because this is no longer about me uh

376
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,360
you know i built we we built that pixel

377
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,920
sec we had kind of rudimentary branding

378
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,040
for a long time and then as the

379
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,199
community came together we built this

380
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,680
you know now dead pixel sec brand so now

381
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,920
you can go to discord gg slash dead

382
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,160
pixel sec and you can jump in we've got

383
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,600
we've got logos we've got t-shirts we

384
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,360
got things and although you know while

385
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,680
that's not an important thing for your

386
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,800
teaching that's not an important thing

387
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,720
for that it does bring branding brings

388
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,959
recognition so when people now see them

389
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,920
the mobius m uh as we're calling them

390
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,800
the malware m you go oh that's that's uh

391
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,480
that's something he's done that's his

392
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,000
product and

393
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,920
those are actually important things to

394
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,079
have because as far as brand recognition

395
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,079
goes especially when you're turning into

396
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,360
a business

397
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,440
that's that's that m is part of your

398
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,320
income

399
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,399
yeah that's why pepsi changes their logo

400
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,160
coke changes logos they get hip every

401
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,560
couple decades they do these things and

402
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,160
so when you find your target audience

403
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,920
and you figure out figure it out and you

404
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,440
know then you figure out what they like

405
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,120
you you bring your targeting your

406
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,440
branding and then you make your first

407
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,680
hundred bucks i'm just throwing random

408
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,560
number out there you make your first

409
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,959
hundred bucks off of word of mouth

410
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,519
your word somebody else's word you make

411
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,240
your first dollar off of word of mouth

412
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,920
and and that m now stands for your word

413
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,360
of mouth and you want that to be a

414
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,120
positive impact

415
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,959
and so that's why

416
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,560
yes probably not the most important

417
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,399
thing you could be doing there are other

418
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,440
things you've got to make sure your

419
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,160
content is good but having your brand

420
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,160
represent who you are and what you're

421
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,600
doing

422
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,480
to me

423
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,000
highly important because i will respect

424
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,920
a brand and i will expect individuals to

425
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,839
support and back that brand

426
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:34,639
yeah

427
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,320
yeah and that's it's very very on point

428
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,720
um and that's something that

429
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,160
you know as as i started this out i said

430
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,079
i have the means and the ability to

431
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,440
make this

432
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,079
look professional from the start

433
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:52,959
so

434
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,720
i think the first thing i did was i

435
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,600
plunked down a couple hundred dollars to

436
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,000
have logo a logo made

437
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,959
uh and and get some animations done and

438
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,399
then i

439
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:05,519
bought

440
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,639
a very nice camera which you know i'm

441
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,440
usually the crispest one on any given

442
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,399
stream

443
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,079
um because i've got like a 1400 camera

444
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,680
uh i i got a nice mic i've been sound

445
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,800
proofing my uh my office i

446
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,320
have

447
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,040
you know i've tried to do a lot of

448
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,880
things to make this look and feel

449
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,120
professional from the start because i

450
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,079
know that if i could start out that way

451
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,680
that people will have more

452
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,600
draw to it and and

453
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,959
they'll be like oh this isn't just

454
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,680
ragtag and thrown together this is

455
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,240
something that that is being taken like

456
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,320
really seriously and

457
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,240
not to diminish anyone's work like if

458
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,680
you don't have the budget not everybody

459
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,600
does especially if you're just starting

460
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,920
out but if you can

461
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,680
uh you should

462
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,959
um

463
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,040
because yeah that really does help push

464
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,279
recognition and

465
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,439
and uh professionalism

466
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:06,160
yeah

467
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,760
the worst thing you want is to have a

468
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,480
scratchy mic or a blurry camera or a

469
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,000
computer that's rebooting every 10

470
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,880
minutes during the class and it's it's

471
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,119
i've been on streams where my systems

472
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,199
weren't functioning well and in and

473
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,119
again taking the different approach you

474
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,599
went business i kind of went hobbyist i

475
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,599
threw my stuff together and

476
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,679
and while we both have brands you know

477
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,039
again the professional brand that you're

478
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,880
going to want to pay to go learn malware

479
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,559
mobius the guy that if you're it's a

480
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:33,919
tuesday night and you're bored and he's

481
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,760
streaming and you go watch that's the

482
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,280
blind hacker right so that's there's and

483
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,000
there's key differences with the way we

484
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,840
started my stuff was definitely ragtag

485
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,400
either there was you know not much of

486
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,080
this going on and then

487
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,679
hey why don't we turn this professional

488
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,000
this is the way to do it and through

489
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,120
mobius using my failures and successes

490
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,840
has been had more success doing those

491
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,880
things

492
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,010
yeah at least you know i'm trying to

493
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:04,080
[Laughter]

494
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,360
so uh a part of this is that

495
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,120
you know when you're when you're

496
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,600
creating your content uh you know one of

497
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,440
the things is that you want some you

498
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,440
want a place that people can go to to

499
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,720
easily find your work i.e a website

500
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,080
um

501
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,559
they're not as easy as you think if

502
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,200
you've never been in that space before a

503
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,200
lot of people uh

504
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,000
myself included have had jokes about

505
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,240
people who do web design

506
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,520
and

507
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,679
one of the things that

508
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,720
i had is when i when i first

509
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,160
uh started i was like oh i'll just build

510
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,679
a site myself i've already got

511
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,440
squarespace

512
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,679
um i can uh i can i could probably

513
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,320
integrate like all these moving pieces

514
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,720
i'm not even quite sure of

515
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,080
but i could probably just put it all

516
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,600
into there right because um

517
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,440
you think well i that's a really good

518
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,240
way to to put it out there and everybody

519
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,799
has a website and it's fine it's

520
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:05,919
uh

521
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,760
but you got to think about like how

522
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,360
people are going to access it how people

523
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,600
are going to pay for it how people are

524
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,720
going to

525
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,600
um

526
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,760
see things like once they're on the site

527
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,960
you know you know are you going to have

528
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,720
a members only area are you going to

529
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,520
have

530
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,919
uh your video hosting

531
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,720
or your videos uh hosted on your website

532
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,480
like what are these things

533
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,559
that you are going to need to do most

534
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,559
people just think it's

535
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,360
it's super easy and i can just build it

536
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,600
myself

537
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,280
so

538
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,600
here's your first problem in that uh you

539
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,640
are

540
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,640
probably going to want your site to look

541
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,080
really nice

542
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,400
and there are a lot of pre-built

543
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,840
templates out there and there are a lot

544
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,760
of things that you can just kind of slap

545
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,160
together and it looks it looks good

546
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,200
the problem is is that when you start

547
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,280
doing all of the things

548
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,360
required and like like i was just

549
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,720
talking about

550
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,880
um

551
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,880
you're gonna start running into

552
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,159
a lot of different

553
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,720
hold-ups uh

554
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,240
there's gonna be a lot of snags yep so

555
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,720
first of all for

556
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,960
the mains that i

557
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,360
started at uh for squarespace and and

558
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,360
looking at wix and wordpress

559
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,320
um you know you have your monthly

560
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,200
fees

561
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,720
right which can

562
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,880
they could be kind of expensive to

563
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,880
really expensive

564
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,679
uh

565
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,559
if you are charging for things well

566
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,400
guess what you're going to have to do a

567
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,320
transaction fee

568
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,520
through the site on top of the processor

569
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,240
fee through whoever you go through so

570
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,720
if that's stripe if that's paypal

571
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,720
whatever the case may be you're going to

572
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,799
have an additional amount cut off the

573
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,840
top immediately and you might not think

574
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,039
that

575
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,679
you know seven percent of a transaction

576
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,440
fee is that much

577
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,000
until you realize that that is

578
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,080
you know across the board

579
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,400
and then on top of the 2.9 percent

580
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,159
plus 30 cents which is what most um

581
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,600
processors

582
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,559
take

583
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,880
so you're looking at almost 10

584
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,880
of every purchase

585
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,080
gone

586
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,320
like you you don't even see it so when

587
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,000
you're charging hundred dollars a course

588
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,520
that's immediately

589
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,480
oh your your total income is going to be

590
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,840
90 per course now yeah and that's boom

591
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,840
and that's just from that like that's

592
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,919
not anything else

593
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,360
um

594
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,159
because there are a lot of other fees

595
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,679
and things that are hidden that you

596
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,360
don't think about

597
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,240
and

598
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,200
and this is just

599
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,559
keep in mind this is just for the

600
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,320
website right

601
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,840
um

602
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,360
another thing is is that if you have

603
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,919
members only areas well for something

604
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,679
like squarespace you can have them

605
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,600
but in order to do that you have to be

606
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,640
on their highest tier of subscription at

607
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,799
the at the outset

608
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,880
and then you have to pay an additional

609
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,799
subscription fee

610
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,440
uh which has three different tiers

611
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,440
and the first tier only gives you one

612
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,280
singular page

613
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,840
that is a members

614
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,960
so if you have multiple trainings

615
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,679
you're stuck there if you want your

616
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,760
um your content in your videos on

617
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,440
separate pages guess what you can't do

618
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,280
that

619
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,320
and you have a limit of 10 pages um that

620
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,480
will that are members only so you're

621
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,720
paying an extra forty dollars a month on

622
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,559
top of the fifty four dollars a month so

623
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,640
that's almost 100 bucks a month

624
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,840
just for that

625
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,960
so then your your 100 course

626
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,880
per you know if if you have 10 students

627
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,440
an additional 100 period a month

628
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,720
gone yep day one yeah

629
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,080
from the start

630
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,600
welcome

631
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,440
so these

632
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,840
and again like they all have limits they

633
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,320
have limits on um you know the plugins

634
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,080
that you can use they have limits on the

635
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,559
transactions you can make some like wix

636
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,120
allows for i think 500 transactions a

637
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,159
month

638
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,200
um

639
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,840
max so if you have a really popular site

640
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,520
and you have like video

641
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,960
content they only allow 500 transactions

642
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,840
and then

643
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,600
you get hit with additional penalties

644
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,360
and and other things and that's with

645
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,020
their top tier subscription service um

646
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,360
[Music]

647
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,280
and uh wordpress

648
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,760
they have you know

649
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,080
real a lot of ease but then they also

650
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,720
have their own section of

651
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,840
of uh

652
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,960
yeah everything are you using is that

653
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,840
the right plugin is the content save oh

654
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,679
yeah uh

655
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,559
there's there's a reason that you know

656
00:23:58,559 --> 00:23:59,600
you have

657
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,919
you have entire sections of of kali

658
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,799
linux dedicated to wordpress

659
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,799
so the volumes are free uh but

660
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,880
everything else will cost you

661
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,200
um so yeah you're you're looking at this

662
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,400
right

663
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,480
and these are things that

664
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,080
that you need to think about uh as

665
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,639
you're going through um

666
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,840
another thing to think about is that you

667
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,360
are going to have to build all of this

668
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,520
out

669
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,919
while you're making your content

670
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,279
and if you're

671
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,679
making any in-depth content i promise

672
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,600
you this is going to suck all of your

673
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,480
time

674
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,039
all of it and if you have a family

675
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,760
you've got kids you have a full-time job

676
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,559
it is going to take all of your time um

677
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,960
and that's if you know what you're doing

678
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,400
uh like me i'm not a web dev i i

679
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,960
don't know how to do that so i went out

680
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,640
and hired somebody

681
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,880
uh after i had a moment of

682
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,440
i want to teach people malware analysis

683
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,039
and reverse engineering

684
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,480
but i have to figure out how to make

685
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,840
this button work first

686
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,080
i had that i had that conversation and i

687
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,200
was like i you know i'm just going to

688
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,480
pay somebody i'm going to pay somebody

689
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,480
to do it because my time has to go

690
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,760
elsewhere

691
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,760
and and you have to

692
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,640
you really have to

693
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,440
put a priority on your time

694
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,720
versus

695
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,600
um

696
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,039
what you think you can do yourself as i

697
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,360
guarantee it's it's far easier to just

698
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,480
pay for somebody who knows what they're

699
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,559
doing to do it than for you to be like i

700
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,360
could just do it myself

701
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,840
definitely there's um when you're when

702
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,120
you're like you said when you develop

703
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,440
there's content development time there's

704
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,840
content production time and then there's

705
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,400
content editing like you know it's it's

706
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,360
this uh i i've kind of started to equate

707
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,120
it when speaking to other people now

708
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,080
like

709
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,960
essentially you're a director you're the

710
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,360
film crew you're the producer

711
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,919
um that you're the advertising company

712
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,760
you don't have warner brothers logos

713
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,240
behind you you have mobius logos behind

714
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,679
you you have dead pixel logos behind you

715
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,159
you have a blind hacker logos behind you

716
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,320
and when you're responsible for keeping

717
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,559
that up developing content curating it

718
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:15,919
making sure that it makes sense making

719
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,159
sure that it's accurate uh making sure

720
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,039
that it's not again it's not

721
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,400
other people haven't used that exact

722
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,080
same content and if they have you gotta

723
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,159
give them credit uh and then by the time

724
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,200
you get done with all that and then

725
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,000
you're like

726
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,480
uh i wanna sit down i uh you know i told

727
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,559
you i i went through the conundrum of

728
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,240
should i just use a smart website should

729
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,400
i use my self-hosted should i or should

730
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,159
i use a smart website and we'll we'll

731
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,559
get to that slide next and and these uh

732
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,400
i shouldn't say smart a a already kind

733
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,039
of pre-built teaching website

734
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,400
right

735
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,720
and then you go

736
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,799
okay finally i've got content done and

737
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,679
now this

738
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:54,559
yeah

739
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,000
so

740
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
this was one of the

741
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,039
first points brought up to me uh when i

742
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,960
was talking about developing my content

743
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,799
and if i should have a website and

744
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,400
looking through all of that

745
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,279
um

746
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,320
a lot of people will

747
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,760
say oh well why don't you just go

748
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,159
through udemy or why don't you go

749
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:15,760
through pluralsight

750
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,840
uh why don't you go through you know

751
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,279
whoever

752
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,360
well there are a couple of caveats that

753
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,799
i didn't know

754
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,960
before i started getting into this

755
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,919
uh what is required for all of those

756
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,080
so

757
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,159
first of all uh of the the four

758
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:37,520
the four mains

759
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,520
that that i looked at um

760
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,039
you own it

761
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:46,399
to an extent or you don't at all

762
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,000
um

763
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,480
so in

764
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,799
in the instance of like plural site

765
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,960
uh when you create it for them you can't

766
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,279
put it anywhere else uh the same with

767
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,600
linkedin learning it's

768
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,520
it belongs to them

769
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,360
and there are

770
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,840
provisions in place that you cannot make

771
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,559
the content of the same kind in the same

772
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:11,440
way to the same audience anywhere else

773
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,520
like they own it so you can only go

774
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,520
through them for that particular topic

775
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,640
at infinitum uh it's it's always going

776
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,240
to be through them so you are

777
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,279
essentially

778
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,120
giving them ownership of your content

779
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,080
right

780
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,120
um

781
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,440
for something like teachable and udemy

782
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,240
you do own your content

783
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,480
but

784
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,960
there are

785
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,320
limitations

786
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,000
um

787
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,720
udemy has the limitation of you

788
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,799
can only change your content with this

789
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,840
within a certain time frame

790
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,640
and teachable has the

791
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,559
the uh

792
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:56,559
catch of you are paying them to host

793
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:00,000
your content so it's there

794
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,720
but you can be paying anywhere from 39

795
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,799
to 300

796
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,880
a month

797
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,200
um

798
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,200
and so it's

799
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,120
it's a trade-off right

800
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,360
pluralsight linkedin you have to

801
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,120
audition

802
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,919
to have your content on their platforms

803
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,000
uh and and i believe linkedin learning

804
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,080
you're actually a contractor

805
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,039
um

806
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,039
which is

807
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,760
that that process you submit

808
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,799
your content and they may or may not

809
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,799
even see it there's no guarantee that

810
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,799
your content will be looked at

811
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,880
and then if you are

812
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,880
uh brought on

813
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,320
you're you know

814
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,720
you're basically a contractor and in the

815
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,240
same vein as plural site you have to

816
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,880
have your content signed off on

817
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,039
by a content manager

818
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,279
so you may have a vision for what you

819
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,360
want to teach or what you want to do and

820
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,679
they may just completely mix that off

821
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,840
the bat

822
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,000
so you know there are these these

823
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,799
caveats that you need to consider

824
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,440
before you try to submit

825
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,679
your training uh through them as

826
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,919
platforms right

827
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,840
and then you look at the

828
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,440
um the revenue and most of these do not

829
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,039
give you just

830
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,760
they paid money you get the money it's

831
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,320
not how it works

832
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,919
for pluralsight and linkedin you have

833
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,440
royalties

834
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,080
right and the majority of the time it's

835
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,559
what traffic you're generating

836
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,679
to the site or to your specific videos

837
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,240
if you have content that drives a lot of

838
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,440
viewers

839
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,200
you get paid more

840
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,679
if you don't you get paid less

841
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,080
uh pluralsight does it on view time if

842
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,480
your videos somebody only spends you

843
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,279
know five minutes out of an hour which

844
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,919
most of the videos can't be that long

845
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,840
and they they have a threshold on on how

846
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,240
long your content can be

847
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,679
you get paid less

848
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,399
uh for teachable you get

849
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,480
you know your net minus transaction and

850
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,559
processing fees and they

851
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,240
there's something else depending on the

852
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,399
level that you pay

853
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,600
uh and then you get that money udemy

854
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,880
you get a profit share

855
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,399
and depending on how the user finds your

856
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,120
content accesses your content and pays

857
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,760
for your content will determine how much

858
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,240
you get out of that profit sharing but

859
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,679
at a base

860
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,399
you get 37

861
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,120
of any particular sale

862
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,320
to your content and as it

863
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,200
uh

864
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,440
the majority of the time they will take

865
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,919
out taxes if you

866
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,799
uh apply to their promotional

867
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,039
um they have a promotional program to

868
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,159
where you're

869
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,760
like they will actually advertise for

870
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,760
you they will take that out of your

871
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,919
payment so you may only end up with

872
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,760
thirty percent of profit for anything

873
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,120
that you make and udemy stuff is not

874
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,760
only on sale all the time and super

875
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,039
cheap

876
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,360
but udemy has also had a problem of

877
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,559
content

878
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,799
uh theft by

879
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,000
reselling

880
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,720
so

881
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,039
you may not even be able to make as much

882
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,399
money as you would

883
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,799
because somebody has taken your content

884
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:21,600
re-uploaded it and sold it

885
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,600
as their own

886
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,159
so there's actually reasons a lot of fur

887
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:28,320
for these things right so so just to go

888
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,120
over quickly like pluralsight linkedin

889
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,679
right you're you're they're kind of like

890
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,320
in a manner hiring you you produce

891
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,679
content for them that's why you lose

892
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,440
ownership of it right so the royalty uh

893
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,360
the royalties and things like that and

894
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,279
by the way that's an entirely different

895
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,440
tax scenario i've i've run into that

896
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,159
with places that i've taught in the past

897
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,000
that have um

898
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,559
my training over there and i i you know

899
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,000
it's really nice to randomly get these

900
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
randomly royalty checks but then you

901
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,039
know on that view time and popularity

902
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,960
you know hey if they're not pushing my

903
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,880
content and also i'm not getting it but

904
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,720
then yes i can go push my content but

905
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,399
then when a lot of these places like

906
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,480
linkedin learning and pluralsight they

907
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,880
now have a pass right this past and as

908
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,159
you said if there's

909
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,840
that it's based on length of time and

910
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,080
other things and that pass now goes to

911
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,080
big pile of money and then they pay it

912
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,679
out just to the people who are

913
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,080
essentially getting the views now you

914
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,080
create teachable that's your website

915
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,159
your content you have to again you're

916
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,799
going to be spending time building that

917
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,200
um and as you see the prices there they

918
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,399
they vary

919
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,559
largely per month and i i don't know if

920
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,480
the 299 is there they're a max plan i

921
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,240
think there's a enterprise that's closer

922
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,120
to like 1200 a month there is yeah and

923
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,320
so and then

924
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,320
like you said minus tax and processing

925
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,240
well processing as we've talked another

926
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,960
10 off that tax they they will collect

927
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,679
the tax um in it and if you if you opt

928
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:55,519
in for things like that if not it comes

929
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:57,039
down to you as the business owner to do

930
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,279
things and so you're immediately you

931
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,559
know again we're going back to our

932
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,240
hundred dollars per student

933
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,679
and you're like i'm already losing it

934
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,360
well apparently the the trick i've

935
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,559
learned about udemy is the reason you

936
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,639
see them on promo all the time is when

937
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,960
you do a promo and udemy's like hey it's

938
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,119
promo season throw up a promo they give

939
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:14,399
you more of the percentage of your

940
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,159
profit yes

941
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,359
which is great

942
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,599
but now you're also not making nearly as

943
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,599
much because you have to like

944
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,839
severely discount yourself oh this is a

945
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:24,960
hundred dollar course you have to give

946
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,199
it away for

947
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:29,040
13. 9.99

948
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,079
and yeah trust me as the guy who buys a

949
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:34,800
lot of 9.99 courses

950
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,199
just a support other authors and

951
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:40,159
creators but but you know at least now

952
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,320
they're looking at that's their 9.99 of

953
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,919
profit but after you've spent

954
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,159
countless hours building these websites

955
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,719
your promos branding

956
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,079
you're taking a real you're taking a

957
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,079
real hit here and especially when you

958
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,000
know uh you look at these pay schedules

959
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,240
quarterly that's that's my royalty uh i

960
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,520
don't teach through pluralsight but a

961
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,640
similar site

962
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,200
quarterly that's fine you know monthly

963
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,800
i'll be a little bit nicer but at the

964
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,720
same time it would be so small at that

965
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,240
point it would just get zapped up by

966
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,079
netflix hulu and paying all my bills

967
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,680
right uh

968
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,240
uh teachable uh you know that's your

969
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,520
choice you choose daily monthly udemy um

970
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,839
again uh every uh

971
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:23,040
kind of monthly uh or i think it's

972
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,040
there's an opt-in per transaction but

973
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,599
then there's a higher uh uh processing

974
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:28,960
fee and

975
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,440
as you're seeing here the the cost

976
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,000
versus value really starts to dwindle

977
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,400
when you do build it on your own

978
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,760
and and

979
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,560
then you know again what uh as you theft

980
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,920
from you to me how do you protect

981
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,680
yourself from that oh well use linkedin

982
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,440
or these other branded sites pluralsight

983
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,640
because then people know oh why is

984
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,320
pluralsight content on udemy somebody

985
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,760
stole it well

986
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,680
then then you have a case but when uh it

987
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,200
gets stolen from you to me and gets put

988
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,040
on um

989
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,000
uh tnw share or all these other places

990
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,880
that are just kind of stack stack

991
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,400
skillshare

992
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,560
you know dot co dot uk or whatever

993
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,320
there's almost nothing you can do too

994
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,680
because

995
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,440
they're

996
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,280
either they've hijacked it and stole it

997
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,040
and you can apply to them and then they

998
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,720
might remove it but then three weeks

999
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,560
later somebody else will upload it

1000
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,359
right

1001
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:18,560
and that's

1002
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,680
like every

1003
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,920
every possible solution for a lot of

1004
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,240
this stuff like there is it introduces

1005
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,880
another problem or another

1006
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,880
avenue that you have to think about

1007
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,000
um

1008
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,240
and so yeah like it's a juggling act

1009
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,440
right

1010
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,359
um

1011
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,160
but

1012
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,400
you know after looking at a lot of this

1013
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,880
and discussing it with people

1014
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,480
i decided to self-host

1015
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,000
now

1016
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,040
when i say that i'm self-hosting i mean

1017
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,520
that i have a developer

1018
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,599
making my website

1019
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:54,640
for me

1020
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,599
from

1021
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:56,960
the ground up

1022
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,839
um

1023
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:01,920
the apis the back end the front end like

1024
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,000
mine it is

1025
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,920
it's totally not dependent on anything

1026
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,720
else

1027
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,440
so the most that i have to deal with is

1028
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,920
um you know the the basic processing fee

1029
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,440
for using

1030
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,320
um

1031
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,440
the

1032
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,720
the vendor to uh to take payments uh and

1033
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,760
then i

1034
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,119
pay for

1035
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,720
yearly hosting

1036
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,760
and that's

1037
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,440
that's that right

1038
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,880
um i can have it exactly as i want

1039
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,560
it is

1040
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,079
set

1041
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,240
in that way i'm but i'm not having to do

1042
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,320
profit shares i'm not having to worry

1043
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,760
about views popularity or promos i don't

1044
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,920
have to do any of that i

1045
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,760
set it to

1046
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,560
what i want and i may pay a little bit

1047
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,880
more up front but then i have full

1048
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,599
control over my content

1049
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,760
and to me that's really important that i

1050
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,800
have control while also not bleeding

1051
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,839
you know

1052
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:01,280
all this other money because

1053
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,280
x y and z well that's his business

1054
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,200
decision right yeah that's you stay in

1055
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,920
business you make money you retain money

1056
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,480
yeah you have you have to

1057
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,760
all right so

1058
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,200
uh

1059
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,640
when you are

1060
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,320
thinking about this

1061
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,880
you want to look at like how you're

1062
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,440
actually

1063
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,480
giving your content to students right

1064
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,000
are you going to have

1065
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,280
like a

1066
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,119
learning management system

1067
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:32,000
uh are you going to put it on github are

1068
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,440
you going to

1069
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,280
you know have things that are that are

1070
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,320
just linked off of your main site um are

1071
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,359
you recording are you doing live

1072
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:44,480
uh training are you doing like a hybrid

1073
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,200
kind of a thing um

1074
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,280
you know if you're if you're doing it

1075
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,079
live

1076
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,359
how are you interacting with your

1077
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:52,320
students

1078
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,320
one of the biggest things that i wanted

1079
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,240
was the ability to actually interact

1080
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,079
with my students

1081
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,280
and

1082
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,599
it turns out it's kind of hard to do

1083
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:05,599
that on a lot of platforms uh you have

1084
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,839
things like twitch

1085
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:09,920
but twitch has a

1086
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,839
a sizable delay

1087
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:13,119
in

1088
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,119
the video to the chat

1089
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,960
so when people are asking questions i

1090
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,800
may not see it for a good 15 to 30

1091
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,839
seconds

1092
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:22,480
and then so i've got that delay going

1093
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,800
and then the video quality and the audio

1094
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,800
quality get downgraded and it's like

1095
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,000
that for uh twitch it's like that for

1096
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,480
big blue button it's like that for

1097
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,560
um you know

1098
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,599
i

1099
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,720
it can be to an extent uh zoom and you

1100
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,480
know so there are a lot of different

1101
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,320
things that you have to think about when

1102
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,480
you want to interact because sometimes

1103
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,000
you just have people typing at you but

1104
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,520
you want to hear them like i want to

1105
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,160
hear them so right now my courses

1106
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,960
i teach over discord because i can fit

1107
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,040
everybody into a classroom

1108
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,640
people can talk they can ask questions

1109
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,880
when they need to they can chat amongst

1110
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,800
themselves while i'm teaching like

1111
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,560
there's a really good balance

1112
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,160
uh and although that may not be the

1113
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,079
permanent solution it's it's something

1114
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:07,760
to consider

1115
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,160
when you're figuring out how you want to

1116
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,280
do these sorts of things all right

1117
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,079
i mean there's like you said the discord

1118
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,079
uh eventually you could build a jitsi

1119
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:19,440
server with

1120
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,920
streaming and the classroom and a

1121
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,319
whiteboard and ask questions but again

1122
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:26,480
now you're talking additional expenses

1123
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,200
additional content additional things and

1124
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,760
again your are your goal here as a as a

1125
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,720
teacher is to teach as a business person

1126
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,119
to make money so the less time the less

1127
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:39,359
time you spend teaching

1128
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,200
making money the again the more money

1129
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,760
you're putting out and ultimately it

1130
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,000
becomes this thing like in the back of

1131
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,440
everyone's head you're like i'm doing

1132
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,800
this for the good i'm doing this for the

1133
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,119
children doing this for the students

1134
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:52,800
but it's hitting really hard to do this

1135
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,200
i'm losing money and then at by time you

1136
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,520
said you build all this out

1137
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,440
and then uh you get to the point where

1138
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,280
you're like what do i do

1139
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,800
uh and then you start building it like

1140
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,560
and then you move to the next phase

1141
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,160
i like this face right here the your

1142
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,720
environment and demo gods uh as uh if

1143
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,920
bsd were around uh i uh i i've i've been

1144
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,200
at conferences with him before and i'll

1145
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,200
be like demo gods

1146
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,119
and uh right before he goes up and he

1147
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:18,960
just cracks up laughing because and i

1148
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,160
want everybody to think about any time

1149
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,839
you go to give a demo

1150
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:24,400
demo god you're afraid of the demo gods

1151
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,480
pray to them because there's

1152
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,480
it can go horribly wrong and trust me

1153
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,040
doing live streams uh instead of

1154
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,560
curated content

1155
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,240
and nothing wrong with either way right

1156
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,400
uh as you said with twitch uh i had to

1157
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,720
beat certain numbers i had to get out

1158
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,160
there i had to

1159
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,079
um get subscribers i had to get a

1160
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:43,280
certain number of followers and then i

1161
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,240
became a associate or whatever twitch

1162
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,640
not partner some intermediate level um

1163
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,720
now i can stream at 1080p but my screen

1164
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:54,000
downstairs is 4k my screen here is 2k my

1165
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,680
and then now i'm trying to fit a kali

1166
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,240
window into a 10 um

1167
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,000
1080p screen and then again you know

1168
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,119
most people are probably watching from

1169
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,760
this little thing on a cell phone uh

1170
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,520
and they're you know it's got a high

1171
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,040
resolution but the quality is lowered

1172
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,880
anyway because it's coming through

1173
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,280
you're throttled and then you go

1174
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,680
uh multiple times with the the demo gods

1175
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,520
where i'm just in the middle of a box if

1176
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,079
i downloaded the vm from bonehub and i

1177
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,000
was doing it the vm would crash or

1178
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,240
something would go awry my system could

1179
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,520
crash

1180
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,880
how do you recover from that when you're

1181
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,200
streaming oh you know i've seen

1182
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,880
streamers have a

1183
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,680
a dedicated streaming box they pump out

1184
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,599
a 1600 to 2200 box that sits there they

1185
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:38,079
powered on they have obs and it takes it

1186
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,560
from their other gaming box another 16

1187
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,200
1200 block man oh my god we're talking

1188
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,720
uh this is getting expensive and as a

1189
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,359
hacker i'm like i mean i just need to

1190
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:50,319
show my screen and do this and and uh

1191
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:52,400
who cares from you know again this is my

1192
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,280
my layman's perspective uh

1193
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,119
i didn't go the full business route i've

1194
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,200
i've produced content and courses again

1195
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,440
they're curated like you said management

1196
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,960
somebody else is really making the money

1197
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,720
off of it i get a little bit of things

1198
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,079
and then

1199
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:08,240
now uh after talking to you about all

1200
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,079
this and seeing your struggles and kind

1201
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:12,560
of sharing the experience about it

1202
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,640
you get to the point where the democrats

1203
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,240
are here and and we're trying you're

1204
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,720
trying to put things together and

1205
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,720
i think it's important that you test

1206
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,079
things it's important that you have

1207
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:24,319
again do you have that box next to the

1208
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:26,400
box and that other box is fully updated

1209
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,960
you you reboot it before every stream

1210
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,240
and you bring it up and you get on your

1211
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,760
gamer box and that's why you've seen

1212
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,839
people gaming and then lights out the

1213
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:36,079
gaming uh picture's gone and you're

1214
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:37,760
they're just staring at the camera like

1215
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,200
uh

1216
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,119
yeah yeah every every time there's

1217
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:44,640
and and we're going to get to that here

1218
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,599
in just a few slides but yeah it's it's

1219
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:49,920
really

1220
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,560
there's so much that goes into it

1221
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,599
um

1222
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:55,359
and there are so many problems that can

1223
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:57,359
arise right

1224
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:00,079
but when you are

1225
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,079
when you're teaching

1226
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:04,079
a lot of people something that they've

1227
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:06,319
never really done before

1228
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:08,640
uh there is a high probability that

1229
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,880
something is going to go wrong all right

1230
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,960
and that's why you know when i was

1231
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,040
initially doing this like i'm teaching

1232
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,880
malware analysis

1233
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,319
so i have live malware

1234
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:23,200
it's not the same as is uh like a red

1235
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,720
team kind of a thing or if you're doing

1236
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,280
like offset training or ctfs where if

1237
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,200
you hit a wrong command it's like oh

1238
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,880
well this didn't work

1239
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,280
but for malware if you hit a wrong

1240
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,720
command hey you just infected your

1241
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,960
system

1242
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,000
whoopsie

1243
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,119
and

1244
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:41,680
you may or may like windows defender may

1245
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,599
or may not see it it's it's gotten

1246
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:46,079
markedly better but there are what on

1247
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:48,319
average 10 000 new malware variants a

1248
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:51,760
day minimum

1249
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,000
we obviously haven't solved security so

1250
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,599
there's a high likelihood that something

1251
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:57,680
is going to infect your system we don't

1252
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,800
want that

1253
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,800
so my initial

1254
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,240
thing was to

1255
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,920
set up a base image and have everyone

1256
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,480
download it and build their own lab

1257
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,160
well the problem with that is is that

1258
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,720
the base flare image on a windows

1259
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,359
installation is about 80 gigabytes

1260
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:15,119
so that's huge

1261
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:17,200
and i can't reasonably expect everyone

1262
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,720
to download that

1263
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,560
um

1264
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,760
uh having the students do it

1265
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,680
somebody may not be comfortable with

1266
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,920
that at the outset they may misconfigure

1267
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,680
something they may

1268
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,560
you know

1269
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,599
you've got different versions of things

1270
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:36,079
there's so many different variables

1271
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:39,040
and you don't want to spend your class

1272
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,040
helping to troubleshoot other people's

1273
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,640
systems

1274
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,319
so it's difficult to to go into it um

1275
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:50,319
and and do that so what i ended up doing

1276
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:52,720
uh was going through the cloud i was

1277
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,240
like i want to

1278
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,079
teach people and i want to streamline it

1279
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:58,560
as much as possible

1280
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,520
so i looked at a few different factors

1281
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,800
uh between aws and microsoft azure which

1282
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,240
was uh

1283
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,760
kicked over to me by somebody actually

1284
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,359
from deadpixelsec

1285
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:11,680
and

1286
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:14,480
there's a market difference in

1287
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,720
what you can do on each platform and how

1288
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,480
easy it is

1289
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,160
you know for instance azure i really

1290
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,400
like it because azure labs they

1291
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,119
put out things for hackathons and they

1292
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:26,720
encourage that

1293
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,680
but aws doesn't like that and actually

1294
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,160
they have a policy where you can't run

1295
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,760
malware on them on any virtual machine

1296
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,880
which uh like i said the irony burns

1297
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,640
as somebody who does

1298
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:44,480
threat intel and uh and malware analysis

1299
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,440
because my god there's so much

1300
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,640
malware out there that comes from aws

1301
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,839
um

1302
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:54,079
the nice thing about azure is you pay as

1303
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:56,960
you go so you only pay for what up time

1304
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:01,599
is used uh at this point i think i'm

1305
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:03,920
i'm i've paid out maybe

1306
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,200
on average about 150 a month and i give

1307
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,640
each of my

1308
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,640
30 registered students

1309
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,839
20 hours of time outside of class

1310
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:14,880
um

1311
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,599
so two hours a week

1312
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,920
for nine weeks it's 18 hours

1313
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,240
plus you know so you've got basically 38

1314
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,400
hours of time that could be used and the

1315
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,480
maximum that i'll pay for that is about

1316
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,880
550 to 600

1317
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,119
um

1318
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:33,280
so that's really nice whereas with aws

1319
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,559
you have to buy all the credits up front

1320
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,480
and you may not use that time and then

1321
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,359
you know

1322
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:38,880
there's there's a lot of things it's

1323
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,559
also

1324
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:43,520
much harder to use and set up and not to

1325
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,040
say that i haven't had my issues with

1326
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,200
azure and if there's anybody out there

1327
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,720
that knows azure networking with labs

1328
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,440
i will pay you money to help me

1329
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,960
because i've had an issue outstanding

1330
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,640
for several months now that i cannot get

1331
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,160
rectified

1332
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,920
we'll call it the malware mobius's

1333
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:00,960
intern

1334
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,800
yeah right

1335
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,480
or uh microsoft moby says we're talking

1336
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,200
about in chat right now yeah so

1337
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:10,000
i i wanted to streamline it and and

1338
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,920
that's what i've done largely there's

1339
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,599
still hiccups but

1340
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,920
it's it's much simpler than the

1341
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,599
alternatives

1342
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:18,960
all right

1343
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,110
uh the next thing to to talk about is um

1344
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:23,280
[Music]

1345
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,119
you know actually putting yourself on

1346
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:26,240
camera

1347
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,280
and

1348
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,599
teaching right

1349
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:31,680
so

1350
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,520
one of the things that

1351
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,720
people

1352
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,400
i i think there's there's a lot of

1353
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,920
people that don't think about this a

1354
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,960
death by powerpoint is awful death by

1355
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,440
monotone screen cap

1356
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,000
is worse

1357
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,599
i have tried to learn so many things

1358
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:51,760
from multiple sites and it's just

1359
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:52,880
somebody

1360
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,880
very monotone

1361
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,319
with with

1362
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:59,599
recording keystrokes and screen caps

1363
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:01,520
and it's it's hard

1364
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,400
it's really hard so

1365
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,280
what i wanted to aim to do was to have

1366
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,880
like hey we're gonna have a conversation

1367
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,200
about this like i want to teach you and

1368
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,280
i want to show you why this is cool i

1369
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,559
want to show you

1370
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:16,880
why you might want to do this

1371
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,079
and

1372
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,839
and i want to do it in a way that i

1373
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:22,160
don't look awful and i don't sound awful

1374
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,119
and and you know all of these things so

1375
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:27,599
you know again for my office which you

1376
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:30,240
can't see a whole lot of my walls here

1377
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,960
uh i have foam that i got off of amazon

1378
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,119
for like 20 bucks you get a 12 pack

1379
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:37,040
something like that

1380
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,640
yeah you keep it really simple it's

1381
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,280
super easy to set up uh use some command

1382
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,520
strips it doesn't even require nails and

1383
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,280
it deadens the sound so now you don't

1384
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,839
echo you get a couple of flex lights so

1385
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:49,280
that you have proper lighting and you're

1386
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,400
not washed out or you know super dark um

1387
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,280
because most of us are are just always

1388
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:56,720
in front of a computer so we're kind of

1389
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:00,240
pale by nature um

1390
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,599
you wanna

1391
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,599
yeah you wanna you wanna look you wanna

1392
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:05,359
look decent you wanna sound decent and

1393
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:07,040
and you want people to want to pay

1394
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,880
attention to you

1395
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,640
that's key

1396
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:11,839
um

1397
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,599
because if you're just monotone screen

1398
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:15,920
cap nobody's gonna care it's it's it's

1399
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,599
hard to get through

1400
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:20,480
and and i'm sorry i don't mean to attack

1401
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:23,440
anyone out there if you've done that um

1402
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,720
but

1403
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:29,440
for me i i want to feel engaged right

1404
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,319
so

1405
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:32,640
i feel like that's rather important and

1406
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,119
and you know joe you agree with me that

1407
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:36,640
absolutely it's

1408
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,319
it's a good thing to do

1409
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:40,000
uh again there's there you know there's

1410
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,680
there's ways to teach and and i'm

1411
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,839
learning more myself every day uh i

1412
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:46,640
recently watched uh something with uh

1413
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,640
some of the biggest uh webcasters and

1414
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,160
they started turning their cameras off

1415
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,359
so that way they're not worried about

1416
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:52,240
what they're looking like just like

1417
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,720
weird little things that as you as you

1418
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,559
you set up you do those things and then

1419
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:58,640
you learn maybe i'll turn the camera off

1420
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,720
today and that way i'm not worried about

1421
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,160
what i'm doing how i'm looking going

1422
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,680
from there and yeah there's there's a

1423
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,599
lot much that stuff so

1424
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,200
uh teaching it's different now we gotta

1425
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,480
roll a little bit faster movies yeah i

1426
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,400
was gonna say we're running out of time

1427
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,720
this is uh the the how is just as

1428
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,720
important as the why uh more so as it

1429
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,400
says so uh

1430
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,160
i think we talked about this uh uh

1431
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,440
really quickly everybody learns

1432
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,880
differently everybody teaches

1433
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,040
differently everybody teaches who learns

1434
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,800
differently to learn to teach someone

1435
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,440
differently um and and when our

1436
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,800
conversation with this was like well if

1437
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,280
you're a visual teacher if you're a uh

1438
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,839
storyteller i'm a big visual storyteller

1439
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:35,200
uh

1440
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,559
and and i try to teach with that so that

1441
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:39,520
way if somebody remembers it later

1442
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,200
yeah so yeah

1443
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,720
and it's it's

1444
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,599
you know you may have a like a vision

1445
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:47,599
for how you want to you know provide

1446
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:48,960
your content

1447
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,520
but there are times where i've been like

1448
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,119
oh i thought this this was really great

1449
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:55,599
and somebody's like ah this was actually

1450
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:58,240
bad this was bad you could fix it but

1451
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,280
it's bad

1452
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,559
so

1453
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:01,760
you know

1454
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,920
keep in mind that you're you're going to

1455
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,800
have to adapt to how you teach and

1456
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,000
learning how to teach is very important

1457
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,040
um

1458
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:14,079
a lot of us are not the best at teaching

1459
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:15,920
uh and and sometimes you have to break

1460
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,200
it down in different ways you use

1461
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,839
different analogies um but just know

1462
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,599
like your first time teaching probably

1463
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:23,440
going to suck you're going to suck

1464
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,680
absolutely it's okay

1465
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,359
and i don't know if i told you i told

1466
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:29,040
you this but something i've heard

1467
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,119
recently is oh i learned it this way why

1468
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:32,960
can't you oh god every time i hear that

1469
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,200
every time i think about that now like

1470
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,640
no no

1471
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,480
i learned it this way i'm going to teach

1472
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,720
you in a way that you know as a teacher

1473
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,200
the best way that i can yes so that way

1474
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,839
you retain the knowledge

1475
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:48,800
yes right um another big thing

1476
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,800
and this is this has been i think my

1477
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,280
most well received module like i'm

1478
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,599
teaching malware analysis right but i

1479
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:58,400
have a module specifically dedicated to

1480
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,760
imposter syndrome and how

1481
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:02,559
you

1482
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:04,800
it like it's okay to feel

1483
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,040
um like you don't know everything

1484
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:10,079
right it's it's okay to feel

1485
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:11,440
you're gonna feel overwhelmed you're

1486
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,640
gonna feel like you don't know enough

1487
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,720
you're gonna feel all of these things

1488
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:18,240
and it's okay because every one of us

1489
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,480
has felt like that at some point when we

1490
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,960
are learning when we are teaching

1491
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,559
you just you feel like you don't know

1492
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:25,680
enough and

1493
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,880
for very complex topics i think that

1494
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,760
it's important to focus on mental health

1495
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,760
and your your emotional outlook at

1496
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:34,559
things

1497
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:35,520
because

1498
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,760
it can be really overwhelming

1499
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,559
and and if if it's too much so people

1500
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:41,920
are just going to drop

1501
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,040
because they're going to be like i have

1502
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,520
to google all this stuff and i feel like

1503
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,960
if that's all i'm doing i'm not really

1504
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,559
learning anything

1505
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,480
so one of the first things i'm i say is

1506
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:51,599
you're going to spend half your time

1507
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:52,880
googling

1508
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,480
like even as a professional you're going

1509
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,640
to google everything all the time you

1510
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,280
can't know everything and that's okay

1511
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,400
um

1512
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,480
talk about your failures like talk about

1513
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,480
these things when i jumped in the day

1514
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,240
you were given this talk uh both times

1515
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,480
now it seems like uh i love it because

1516
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,920
you know from a teacher perspective from

1517
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,079
a mental perspective and from somebody

1518
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:14,880
who is popular on social media or and

1519
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,480
things like that you know i tell people

1520
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,680
all the time like hey i feel that way

1521
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:21,119
too i i i have an era of confidence i do

1522
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:24,079
a thing but ultimately uh it's because

1523
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:25,920
i've i've learned to

1524
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,640
cast it aside and and uh uh realized

1525
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,480
that i'm going to suffer and realize

1526
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,240
that i'm going to have problems and and

1527
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,920
it's normal and it's okay

1528
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,720
yeah yeah this is this is

1529
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,040
what i try to to tell people is that it

1530
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,440
it's gonna be hard and you're going to

1531
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,640
feel

1532
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:45,760
like you don't know anything keep going

1533
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,440
you're going to get better

1534
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,720
um

1535
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,079
you have no choice to if you keep going

1536
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:52,079
if you stop you're not going to yeah you

1537
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:53,839
will never you'll never get anywhere if

1538
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:55,920
it's not for you that's fine but if if

1539
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,359
you think that you might enjoy it if you

1540
00:54:57,359 --> 00:54:59,599
think that you might get into it like

1541
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:01,839
it's going to suck keep going

1542
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:03,839
you will get better you will feel better

1543
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:04,880
okay

1544
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,599
um when it comes to

1545
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:09,599
doing this kind of stuff

1546
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:11,359
like keep doing it

1547
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:13,440
right repetition is key that goes for

1548
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,280
students and teachers

1549
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,000
uh when you're teaching things like just

1550
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,400
go over it right if somebody gives you

1551
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,559
feedback like they didn't feel like the

1552
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:23,839
content was

1553
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:25,520
good or they didn't know how to focus or

1554
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,920
they they couldn't understand like take

1555
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,680
that and

1556
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:32,079
understand like you know for me i i had

1557
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:34,319
a student tell me like i don't feel like

1558
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:36,240
i'm getting this

1559
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,720
because i'm a very goal-oriented person

1560
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:39,920
and i don't think that you're setting

1561
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,319
your goals correctly for this this and

1562
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:43,520
this and i said you know what that's on

1563
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,599
me that's my bad

1564
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:47,920
i i'm sorry that i didn't think about

1565
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:48,799
that

1566
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:50,319
so i'm gonna try to change that going

1567
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:51,520
forward

1568
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:52,880
um

1569
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,280
you know but uh you know

1570
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,920
don't be afraid to to try new things

1571
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:01,880
don't be afraid to

1572
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,119
to mess with your formula right

1573
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:06,400
you're gonna have stuff fail you're

1574
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,079
gonna have stuff break

1575
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:09,599
roll through it

1576
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:10,559
um

1577
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:12,720
my my first class

1578
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,400
i had uh

1579
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,160
i had a a point where my students wanted

1580
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,960
me to have a apology jar instead of a

1581
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,200
swear jar because i was apologizing so

1582
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,280
much for things not going right

1583
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:28,319
it's gonna fail yep just go with it

1584

1585
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,319
