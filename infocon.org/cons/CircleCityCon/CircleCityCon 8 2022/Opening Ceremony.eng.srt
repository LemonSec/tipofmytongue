really couldn't predict except we did

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,320
predict it because last year was the

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,439

their talk

point is not being an ass but heckling

65
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,599
and haranguing the speaker is if you're

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,400
uh there is a schedule uh you can go to

158
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,039
registration.circle citycon

159
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,000
it should be updated fairly regularly

160
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,880
but

161
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,120
any last second changes of course are

162
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,479
going to be announced via discord

163
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,160
announcements so that's the quickest way

164
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,240
to determine if there's a deviation from

165
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,960
the schedule

166
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,800
and of course our conference wouldn't

167
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,960
happen without the love and support from

168
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,039
multiple people and first we want to

169

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,519
infosec and hacking for quite a while as

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,240
ray's gonna ray's gonna point out and uh

242

an infosec project

297
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,360
with just a pringle scan you can

298
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,160
actually create the very same machine

299
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,680
that was used

300
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,839
in world war ii to hide uh

301
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,640
communications um from from any

302
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,880
listeners so you can learn exactly how

303
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,399
the enigma uh log our algorithm and

304
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,079
everything works to figure out okay how

305
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,440
to do this i'm also going to show you

306
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,200
how to encode messages and decode

307
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,160
messages so there's going to be

308

for anything that you have but you can

370
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,399
also go to circlecitycom.com

00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,880
contests to learn about each of these

372
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,639
contests as well but i always recommend

373
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,639
going into the discord channels for ctf

374
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,000
and rfctf rfctf's very interesting this

375
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,399
year because all you need is a browser

376
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,880
or an ssh session

377
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,320
they're basically throwing up some

378
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,079
things in the cloud so that you can be

379
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,560
able to mess around with radio signals

380
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,720
sdr wi-fi

381
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,639
really fun stuff i hope you take

382
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,000
advantage of that if you've ever wanted

383
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,079
to learn wi-fi you don't have a hack rf

384
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,480
you don't have an sdr you don't have the

385
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,399
appropriate tools this is a perfect

386
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,720
opportunity to do so they also have

387
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,480

an ms pain of it uh we're gonna look for

412
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,519
most accurate depiction of what we see

413
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,279
on screen but we're also going to do an

414
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,320
award for most creative so if you want

415
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,639

we're going to judge it all and the most

421
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,760
accurate to what we're seeing here on

422
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,240
screen uh without tracing by the way

423
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,320
tracing will disqualify you if we think

424
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,079
you're too accurate

425
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,639
we might decide to disqualify you that's

426
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,600
purely up to our subjective uh knowledge

427
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,639
um

428
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,079

reserve your seat day of con but

640
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,520

641
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,360
the physical conferences it's been a

642
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,760
little hard to do this year uh for for

643
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,520

711

713
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,360
501c3 status yet we are in the middle of

714
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,919
that with the irs uh and we are getting

715
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,600
that we're hoping in the next 60 days

716
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,039
they'll give us a call and say we're all

717

good to go

718
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,600
um but we have been advised uh by uh

719
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,159
legal folks that uh

720
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,360
even your donations today will be

721
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,360
will be able to be deducted off of taxes

722
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,120
as long as we get that determination

723
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,440
letter later and then certainly after

724
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,679
the termination letter comes through uh

725
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,600
and we have that 501 c threat

726
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,400
status solidified you will have the

727
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,640
ability um to write that off on your

728
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,039
taxes for future donations but we'd love

729
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,480
if you could donate today um and help us

730
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,080
reach that goal of five thousand dollars

731
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,520
we think we can do it i think every i

732
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,679
think we can do it um even if it takes

733
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,279
us just a little extra time but i think

734
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:40,480
everyone can do it so if you would

735
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,440
please uh give give when it's convenient

736
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,919
and give when you're able

737
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,799
and i think that's about it actually so

738
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,400
i think the next order of business will

739
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,240
