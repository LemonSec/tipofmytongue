00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,040
hi everyone hopefully the sound is

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,880
working i hope everyone's doing well and

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,040
thank you for your patience let's dive

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,720
into this talk now

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,240
so today we're going to talk about

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,600
burnout the greatest start to your

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,600
organization security we've always

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,000
talked about burnout before the pandemic

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,640
but even during the pandemic we saw

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,400
so much burnout i think all of us went

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,640
through it at some point but let's be

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,519
real

14
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,680
with each other i think infosec

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,320
basically it runs on burnout and this is

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,000
a huge problem because burnout can lead

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,320
to a security situation so let's dive

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,640
into it

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,399
for those that don't know who i am my

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,039
name is chloe misragi i'm the co-founder

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,079
we open tech which is a group basically

22
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,719
of marginalized genders um and allies

23
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,199
that are trying to change uh how things

24
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,199
are in security and tech to bring gender

25
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,239
equality but we also provide a safe fun

26
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,239
supportive environment

27
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,720
um hacking is not a crime i'm also the

28
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,360
co-founder for that also known as hinak

29
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,040
and we're basically a grassroots

30
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,520
movement to try to get hacker rights

31
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,280
through changing the public perception

32
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,479
of what it is and who is a hacker

33
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:17,759
because we can't get rights unless we

34
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,479
change the public's mind um i'm also the

35
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,360
growth strategy consultant on the side

36
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,920
and advice columnist at security

37
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,479
boulevard so every friday i have an ask

38
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:29,680

and provide advice if you want to learn

42
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,040

44
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,520
yes that is my handle at the top you can

45

47
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:47,759
open

48
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,759
now let's get into the real reason why

49
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,840
you are here

50
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,360
does this seem like familiar to anyone

51
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,079
so this was rsa conference just last

52
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,119
year

53
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,119
and as you could tell the audience was

54
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,719
full of hope

55
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,200
and it was a it was like the starting of

56
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,878
a new year we hugged we shook hands we

57
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,440
attended events full of people we had

58
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,920
drinks and food together we leaned in to

59
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,879
hear each other at busy events we had to

60
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,840
speak extremely loud to be heard across

61
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,080
the table and we even attended karaoke

62
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,879
it was a glorious time

63
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,239
but then

64
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,360
all this happened

65
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,599
and then this happened

66
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,440
and since then

67
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,760
we've been like

68
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,879
this and now we are in 2021 and hoping

69
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,400
things will get better and it does look

70
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,160
like things on the horizon are but it's

71
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,480
still overwhelming because we never had

72
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,360
a moment to catch our breath nor we

73
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,280
never had a guide on how to deal with a

74
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,120
pandemic

75
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,879
and those that try to get therapy

76
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,879
sessions sometimes that was really hard

77
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,319
because there's a wait list and they're

78
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,440
still waiting to get help

79
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,480
so

80
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,640
let's be real with each other right now

81
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,040
we're walking a very fine line of just

82
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,080
being barely okay and terrible

83
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,519
and all of us have been dealing with

84
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,440
burnout well

85
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,959
not all of us

86
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,280
i'm looking at you new zealand lucky

87
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,720
people

88
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,640
but even in new zealand and everywhere

89
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,120
before 2020

90
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,599
in security we've known about burnett

91
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,040
and we have been

92
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,000
through it before all the chaos fell in

93
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,560
2020.

94
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,640
and with burnout we're placing ourselves

95
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,720
and organizations at a huge security

96
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,799
risk we'll most likely click a link

97
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,360
because we're not 100 who we are we may

98
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,200
not patch right or overwhelmed by what

99
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,760
is needed to be patched asap

100
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,000
but let's also be real sometimes we're

101
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,920
kind of seen as bots

102
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,640
and not humans and humans cannot handle

103
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,000
24 7 work because when we are

104
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,239
working all hours and always expected to

105
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,040
be on calls online how do we even

106
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,560
balance personal life and work life

107
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,439
because burnout occurs when we are not

108
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,280
practicing self-care

109
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,360
and when our work demands more from us

110
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,159
we spend less time on personal life and

111
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,400
the balancing is completely gone and

112
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,199
stress increases we feel guilty we we

113
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,199
struggle to sleep because we feel like

114
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,320
we're trying so hard not to drown

115
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,160
and you may even notice changes on your

116
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,400
own team such as like employees would

117
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,759
draw or

118
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,360
fast to become sad or angry or delays in

119
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,919
email response or projects this can be

120
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,000
seen even remote too you don't have to

121
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,080
be in person to notice when employees

122
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,360
are burned out let's be realistic

123
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,880
and right now working from home and

124
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,800
remotely has increased the number of

125
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,080
work hours increased expectations and

126
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,919
has really increased the blurriness of

127
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,840
work time and limits

128
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,360
because you want to let your manager

129
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,360
know that you're working

130
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,000
and we don't really have boundaries

131
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,520
anymore

132
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,919
and some of people have actually quit

133
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,759
because they can't juggle the work and

134
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,000
personal life and because their company

135
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,639
failed them please understand this you

136
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,280
didn't fail yourself your company failed

137
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,240
you

138
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,080
because they couldn't be more flexible

139
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,759
and they don't practice inclusion and

140
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,440
equity and you might be like wait chloe

141
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,960
why are you bringing inclusion equity in

142
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,840
this

143
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,680
but let's be real majority of the

144
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,160
workers that have left are marginalized

145
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,600
persons

146
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,000
and especially women because they've

147
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,400
been always been the person that has to

148
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,160
take care of the kids that has to

149
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,840
prioritize their personal life over

150
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,639
their work and this is a huge setback

151
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,120
for women later on when it comes to them

152
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,039
coming back to their work because of

153
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,039
that gap

154
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,520
so let's be really blunt right now

155
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,759
between you and i we haven't had a nine

156
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,320
to five job for ages it doesn't exist in

157
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,479
infosec and this is a really

158
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,479
contributing factor because employers

159
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,759
push employees to work from nine to five

160
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,240
and yet send emails and slack messages

161
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,800
and text message and call you before and

162
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,600
after hours this places you and your

163
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,560
team

164
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,880
at a very losing situation because they

165
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,120
feel obligated to respond and this is

166
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,280
why the burnout cycle continues

167
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,280
and for those who are not aware of what

168
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,520
burnout starts to form and look like it

169
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,199
could be that it used to take a few

170
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,280
minutes to respond to an email now it

171
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,600
takes an hour or so

172
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,880
you feel exhausted trapped maybe empty

173
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,639
you feel

174
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,759
like

175
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,600
you've pushed yourself to a breaking

176
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,639
point

177
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,240
where you no longer are coming up with

178
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,880
new ideas and not inventive but rather

179
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,520
taking meds to help with the aches

180
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,759
you're overly anxious over events and

181
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,160
deadlines you can easily cry or get

182
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,639
angry faster than usual you may not

183
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,080
respond to friends and family when they

184
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,560
call or text for some time and then this

185
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,599
guilt starts entering

186
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,360
your personal life is completely

187
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,080
slipping now you can feel it slipping

188
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,720
your life is now your work

189
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,360
and you start to feel unappreciated for

190
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,560
your work

191
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,400
at your work and then you become

192
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,720
resentful at your work

193
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,759
and then you end up hating and dreading

194
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,560
your job this is the moment you lose

195
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,800
your team members because what we've

196
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,599
been doing is putting employees at a

197
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,720
huge health risk don't believe me

198
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,479
think about it this way no matter how

199
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,400
much sleep you get you feel exhausted

200
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,160
when you're burned out and emotionally

201
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,400
depleted as well which then mimics

202
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,680
depression

203
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,680
you may even struggle with sleep such as

204
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,680
trouble falling asleep or staying asleep

205
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,440
and when we're stressed out our cortisol

206
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,160
increases and it gets so hard to shut

207
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,319
down our minds which causes us to toss

208
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,319
and turn and reduce deep sleep or even

209
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,319
gain enough rem and when we don't get

210
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,400
proper sleep stress levels increase

211
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,479
mental state can start shifting to

212
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,879
anxiety and depression symptoms

213
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,560
and when we're overly anxious or

214
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,160
experienced

215
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,160
depression

216
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,560
we start to get sick a little bit more

217
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,400
often have you ever caught yourself

218
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,840
suddenly you're getting colds more often

219
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,479
but the usual trends is gastrointestinal

220
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,479
issues headaches infections colds flus

221
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,639
cold sores rashes or irritated skin like

222
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,160
somehow your skin's getting more

223
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,840
irritated

224
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,800
and

225
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,879
the one thing to note is that stress

226
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,520
does lower your immune system

227
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,280
so when our immune system is low and

228
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,680
stress is high your joints and muscles

229
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,680
get stiff because your body is on

230
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,039
survival mode thinking that's a

231
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,360
perceived threat it can even turn into

232
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,760
muscle weakness and fatigue if left

233
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,399
untreated prolonged stress

234
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,479
it increases high blood pressure and

235
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:43,839
then we have to worry about heart

236
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,920
attacks and strokes because there's so

237
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,080
much adrenaline and cortisol over an

238
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,839
extended period

239
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,560
burnout is not a joke it's extremely

240
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,560
serious and we have a real problem in

241
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,640
our industry that's lean our colleagues

242
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,519
and ourselves into this situation

243
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,800
and for those that don't know the

244
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,200
difference between stress and burnout

245
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,519
i always use this as an example when

246
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,880
you're stressed you take a bubble bath

247
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,720
you'll feel better right

248
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,240
but when you're burned out you can take

249
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,839
all the bubble baths you can drink all

250
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,600
the glasses of wine you're not gonna

251
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,959
feel better

252
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,480
that's the difference

253
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,959
burnout happens when we have way too

254
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,839
much stress that has not been dealt with

255
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,480
so let's get real into

256
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,640
why we're still in this burnout trap

257
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,680
within infosec

258
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,040
and we're going to have to look at the

259
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,480
results of our industry because we have

260
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,320
a very interesting industry it's 24 7.

261
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,600
there's not too many industries like

262
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,959
that there's not too many jobs that are

263
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,719
like that but we have those

264
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,240
so here are some facts please note that

265
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,040
these facts were done and uh the

266
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,880
research was done before the pandemic

267
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,720
these numbers are probably much higher

268
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,920
than they are

269
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,680
but twenty one percent he says said that

270
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,680
they've taken a leave of absence because

271
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,720
of job-related stress 41 of csos took

272
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,800
this as a significant step even though

273
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,800
many responded being afraid to take sick

274
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,600
days and 35 percent neglected to take

275
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
all their allotted time off

276
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,399
because 48 ciso said that their work

277
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,800
stress has impacted their mental health

278
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,160
well 35

279
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,200
5

280
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,279
impacted their physical health

281
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,959
40 percent of cso said that their work

282
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,800
stress has impacted their relationships

283
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,120
with their families or children and 32

284
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,720
said it impacted their relationships

285
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,440
with their spouses or romantic partners

286
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,360
and 32 percent said it impacted their

287
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,440
relationship with their friends

288
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,120
23 percent said that they're using

289
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,519
medication or alcohol to manage stress

290
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,120
once again i want to point out these

291
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,600
numbers were done before the pandemic

292
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,519
please note it's probably way higher

293
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,240
than that now

294
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,399
and

295
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,600
when it comes to american cisos and uk

296
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,480
csos about 94 to 95 report that

297
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,320
they basically are working more than

298
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,880
their contracted hours on average 10

299
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,920
hours

300
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,600
more per week

301
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,519
in addition to 83 percent of the

302
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,880
american c-suite execs and 73 of uk

303
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,680
execs confirm that they do indeed expect

304
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,320
security teams to work longer

305
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,600
hours in other words we're expected to

306
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,480
work beyond normal work hours and we

307
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,160
don't get paid for that extra work hours

308
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,600
by the way as you are all aware of

309
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,320
but look the cso is a manager and also a

310
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,920
leader and having someone who's burned

311
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,839
out that leads can become dangerous to

312
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,640
employers security risk and increasing

313
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,839
possibilities and managerial

314
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,760
issues coping with such issues can lead

315
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,640
to them self-medicating on the job and

316
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,720
walk in a very thin line of what is

317
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,079
appropriate

318
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,800
but once again this is not a css fault

319
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,639
please understand that

320
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,600
it's a system that is very much broken

321
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,920
an industry that isn't sufficient in the

322
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,160
long run it is this industry that

323
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,480
continues to fail us and runs on people

324
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,320
being burned out

325
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,320
so let's take a moment here

326
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,240
we have a foundation that doesn't

327
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,639
empower anyone

328
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,800
we have a foundation that disempowers us

329
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,160
in every single way there's no wonder we

330
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,880
have a rotating door and a mental health

331
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,600
crisis in our industry and i'm about to

332
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,360
show you why it's like this

333
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,600
so why are we burned out let's talk

334
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,040
about this

335
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,839
well

336
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,920
by being the security we're monitoring

337
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,560
and operating 24 7 and sometimes we work

338
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,399
throughout the middle of the night

339
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,399
because we cannot sleep well because

340
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,680
we're always at the edge of our seat

341
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,920
when it comes to security because we

342
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,360
know attackers work all hours

343
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,440
and we are always worried when this

344
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,200
breach will occur because it will occur

345
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,880
because we all know if there was a

346
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,320
breach it would be ad hoc style to fix

347
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,720
it don't believe me

348
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,200
well according to the opponent institute

349
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,760
while secure response planning is slowly

350
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,519
improving the vast majority of

351
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,320
organizations surveyed 74 are still

352
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,399
reporting that their plans are either ad

353
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,560
hoc applied inconsistently or they have

354
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,079
absolutely no plans at all

355
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,240
additionally more than half 52 percent

356
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,760
of those with security response plans

357
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,760
said that they never reviewed it or had

358
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,000
no set time period of when to review it

359
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,760
or even testing those plans at any time

360
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,720
and with covet 19 and working from home

361
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,120
how many of these plants have been

362
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,040
updated

363
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,800
yeah this is one of the reasons why we

364
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,320
had a 300

365
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,000
increase of successful breeches

366
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,720
so what did we do we totally forget

367
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,199
about the human element

368
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,880
we throw tools at the problem because

369
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,120
it's so much easier think about it so

370
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,639
much easier to understand the human

371
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,440
element role that plays here

372
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,920
because it's easier for us to comprehend

373
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,440
if we throw more tools at it we'll fix

374
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,440
the problem it doesn't work like that

375
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,440
we're humans

376
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,839
and that does not sort anything out if

377
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,680
anything it makes the situation much

378
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,839
worse because when we add tools to it

379
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,240
guess what it's not in the plan and

380
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,399
coordination is completely off and these

381
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,880
third-party tools we have absolutely no

382
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,199
idea how secure they really are either

383
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,680
so this is really stressful i mean are

384
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,079
you stressed out now i mean perhaps your

385
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,240
crystal level is rising

386
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,160
no well then i want you to imagine a

387
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,160
situation

388
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,399
imagine you're part of a crew and you

389
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,480
just found out your cruise ship is

390
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,519
sinking

391
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,360
but you found that after for some time

392
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,639
because you were alerted by your system

393
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,880
your customers are bored trusting you

394
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,680
for their safety your team is scared

395
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,600
some are paralyzed by the fear of

396
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,959
failing

397
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,800
but you're trying

398
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,519
your best and they're trying their best

399
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,000
but there's a catch here okay your

400
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,560
entire team hasn't slept well and has

401
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,079
seasickness

402
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,120
so they're not exactly 100 state of mind

403
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,720
if anything you could say that they're

404
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,680
kind of

405
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,639
functioning at the same rate as someone

406
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,800
who is burned out

407
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,959
okay so you have the backstory here now

408
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,120
imagine the captain pulls out the safety

409
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,160
binder to know what is the protocol at

410
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,040
that moment unfortunately the binder

411
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,920
that was updated is not on your ship

412
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,399
you're using an old procedure but have

413
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,040
new features on this ship

414
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,440
are you stressed out now

415
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,279
because this is what it's like dealing

416
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,440
with bad plants and when the human

417
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,680
element is taken out it leaves you with

418
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,079
a wreckage

419
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,440
because the truth is

420
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,079
bad actors are everywhere

421
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,320
as you know they attack at all hours

422
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,480
and zero days drop often and we

423
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,240
constantly need to be up to date what

424
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,600
bad actors use that takes time and

425
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,000
energy and this is why we struggle we're

426
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,600
part of a crew and when we don't

427
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,360
function well or communicate well it

428
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,920
becomes a really scary situation

429
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,440
and the reason we're in security is

430
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,519
because we know how incredibly important

431
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,120
it is but we also need to come to terms

432
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,600
that if we work around the clock and

433
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,839
don't practice self-care or

434
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,639
we don't even promote employee wellness

435
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,279
what's the point of it all

436
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,279
because we can be in danger to the

437
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,440
organization as well if we're running on

438
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,720
low battery and feeling not well

439
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,160
and this is why burnout matters

440
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,639
this is why we keep turning

441
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,560
to tools to not find the time to plan

442
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,959
practice and self-care we become that

443
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,440
security team that syncs we won't be

444
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,839
able to fix a breach fast and it's

445
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,360
really really scary

446
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,680
and please don't turn around and blame

447
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,839
your employees if they're not performing

448
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,480
well because the majority of you that is

449
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,959
what happens you let the team member go

450
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,120
without checking to see what have you

451
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,600
done that has reduced their performance

452
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,679
because chances are they're burned out

453
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,079
and feeling very much alone

454
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,319
with kevin 19 we're taking care of

455
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,799
family members on camera daily unable to

456
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,400
leave our homes can't see our friends

457
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,079
and family some of us live alone some of

458
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,000
us put off our important time events

459
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,480
and we've lost people close to us

460
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,240
and our colleagues are struggling we're

461
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,079
worried about keeping a job we're

462
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,799
worried about affording the life we have

463
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,880
we're worried we may get covered we're

464
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,280
worried we may not make it through covid

465
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,600
and we're not a machine

466
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,440
we're human and the human element

467
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,960
created security and runs on security

468
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,039
so we're struggling with saying okay

469
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,600
before covet and during covet

470
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,719
except new zealand

471
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,799
so how can we lead like the prime

472
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,880
minister of new zealand let's think

473
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,840
about it

474
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,919
she worked with the people and planned

475
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,600
and she worked with specialists and

476
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,320
listened and took actions

477
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,480
because the reality is that when we plan

478
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,799
and take actions there's less disruption

479
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,320
when we listen to each other there's

480
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,280
less disruption

481
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,320
and that's what we're going to talk

482
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,080
about is how do you invest in that so

483
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,799
then we can do better

484
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,200
investment number one listen and take

485
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,640
action together

486
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,200
be strong be kind ask your team what

487
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,240
they need

488
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,240
don't just listen i want you to take

489
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,480
actions when we listen to each other and

490
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,080
strategize together on how to improve

491
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,720
the team or department it reduces the

492
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,480
stress because stress happens when we're

493
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,559
not being listened to or feel

494
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,799
uncomfortable to speak up

495
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,240
your colleagues by sharing that certain

496
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,480
tools aren't needed or that a there's

497
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,240
like this tool out there that just flag

498
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,720
things that all in one that is better

499
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,320
and they may share what is missing on

500
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,919
their team

501
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,840
perhaps less meetings are actually

502
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,160
needed let's be real we don't need an

503
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,760
hour meeting most of the time we only

504
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,679
need 15 minutes or sometimes we just

505
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,160
need an email

506
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,160
but by working together on what are the

507
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,480
issues we can collaborate together on

508
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,320
how to reduce issues or completely

509
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,880
resolve them

510
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,200
investment number two plan together

511
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,360
strategize together with collaboration

512
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,039
and listening working together with the

513
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,280
team to make strategies and revisit your

514
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,120
security response plan

515
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,200
make it up to date

516
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,520
revisit your plan every time a new tool

517
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,840
is removed or added team member change

518
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,480
environment change and so on by creating

519
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,720
making solid plants it helps speeds up

520
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,039
the recovery and reduces the stress when

521
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,960
a breach occurs because there's actually

522
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,880
a plan that's up to date

523
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,960
also you kind of owe it to yourselves

524
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,799
your colleagues your organization your

525
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,520
customers as well i mean look at what

526
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,520
new zealand did okay

527
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,360
they planned

528
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,679
they had 25 deaths we had over 560 000

529
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,960
deaths in the us because someone didn't

530
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,919
plan

531
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,600
or listen

532
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,799
or take actions

533
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,919
investment number three

534
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,480
encourage self-care

535
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,000
studies have shown that when dealing

536
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,080
with burnout taking one week off away

537
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,559
from work or anything related to work re

538
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,799
provides recovery for a burnout

539
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,640
if your employee is burned out make sure

540
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,960
that you feel support to take time off

541
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,960
also encourage it often to the team

542
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,559
because majority of employees and

543
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,880
security they're afraid to take time off

544
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,039
because they feel guilty for not being

545
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,600
there to help their colleagues

546
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,640
and or kind of also giving more work to

547
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,960
their colleagues as well or coming back

548
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,559
to a dumpster fire i feel like that's

549
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,080
like the number one thing is always the

550
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,520
worry of i'm gonna come back to a

551
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,200
dumpster fire

552
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,720
so if you can

553
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,480
if you're a manager give everyone one

554
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,240
day off a month for a mental health

555
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,480
break and lastly make sure you have one

556
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,720
day per week dedicated to having

557
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,360
absolutely zero meetings

558
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,480
i mean i mean it one day a week

559
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,799
this could be a monday this could be a

560
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,799
friday this allows your colleagues to

561
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,600
catch up on any items or projects you

562
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,520
don't need to have meetings every single

563
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,760
day have one day where there's no

564
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,240
meetings

565
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,520
investment number four be kind respect

566
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,640
boundaries

567
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,840
please be kind to one another because

568
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,000
from what we have learned when we work

569
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,400
together and understand how we impact

570
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,320
others we start practicing empathy

571
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,080
and empathy is certainly missing at

572
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,440
times in our industry i mean just

573
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,799
listening and being there for one

574
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,240
another is

575
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,640
it reminds us that there's people who

576
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,720
care for each other and because we

577
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,480
cannot assume how someone is doing by

578
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,679
the way that they look or their

579
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,000
performance we do not know what each

580
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
other is going through

581
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,640
so instead of going at someone

582
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,919
reframe

583
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,200
think up

584
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,640
before you speak or act i mean that on

585
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,080
twitter too you guys

586
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,000
because you really don't know how that

587
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,039
will impact the other person

588
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,480
and plus that's kind of like bullying

589
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,720
too so reframe yourself before you do

590
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,039
anything think it through before you

591
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,679
take action or speak

592
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:10,960
because

593
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,720
it's just important for us to be kind to

594
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,280
one another because if anything what we

595
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,159
have seen in the pandemic is that we are

596
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,240
so divided especially in the us it just

597
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,919
feels like we're such a divided country

598
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,200
right now

599
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,720
and it's hard

600
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,520
to

601
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,280
try to have a conversation with someone

602
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,080
who from another political party

603
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,159
and this is the thing we need to we need

604
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,840
to figure this out

605
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,120
because i don't think the politicians

606
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,880
are doing too much about that but it's

607
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,799
something to think about is that the one

608
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,280
thing i can talk about forever about the

609
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,720
pandemic is just the awareness that

610
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,280
we failed as humans to have empathy for

611
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,960
one another

612
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,600
we couldn't get and work things out to

613
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,360
try to make things better

614
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,799
and i think that's one of the things

615
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:55,600
that

616
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,080
uh reason why new zealand shared that be

617
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,120
kind

618
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,960
because that's the element we need to

619
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,520
stick together to protect the world you

620
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,080
know from darkness or security threats

621
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,000
but also from from ourselves

622
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,919
but we also know that being kind is

623
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:16,240
respecting boundaries especially at work

624
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,240
and you know of course

625
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,320
six feet distance and a mask

626
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,080
so what can you do

627
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,720
right now this could only take you about

628
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,120
10 to 15 minutes okay

629
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,559
so it's only going to take 10 to 15

630
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,159
minutes right now you can even take a

631
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,480
screenshot of this slide

632
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,480
and share it with everyone

633
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,240
because the reality is this is how you

634
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,799
can fix this really fast

635
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,000
one just set a weekly 101s for 15

636
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,679
minutes with each employee

637
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,000
what do you mean by that chloe well what

638
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,120
that means is that your manager does not

639
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,679
follow or micromanage you what happens

640
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,240
is that they have a 15-minute

641
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,440
meeting with you it doesn't even have to

642
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,799
be 15 minutes

643
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,000
where you basically are sharing

644
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,679
everything that you're working on and

645
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,360
with your manager so you all are on the

646
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,679
same page and what to prioritize this

647
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,080
helps reduce the stress level but also

648
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,240
allows you and your manager to have good

649
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,200
communication with one another

650
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,679
make monday or friday no meetings day

651
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,679
every week there should be a no meetings

652
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,840
day set for your team

653
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,840
and your department to be honest if you

654
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,400
can make it company-wide do it

655
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,000
monday or friday is always great because

656
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,840
it's always like a holiday so it doesn't

657
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,480
really affect you too much

658
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,080
now you also want to do is set up a

659
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,840
meeting with your team to explore ways

660
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,600
to improve together remember that

661
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,120
strategy session

662
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,799
that's what you need to do basically you

663
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,799
look over your plans

664
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,880
you also need to look over the tools

665
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,400
that you're using

666
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,720
and really think what is missing on the

667
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,520
team what can be improved on and this

668
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,600
should be about an hour meeting

669
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,279
but you should make sure that everyone

670
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,760
in your team participates and make sure

671
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,400
you ensure that everyone feels valid and

672
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,120
feels comfortable speaking up

673
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,799
i'm not going to tell you how to do that

674
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,480
that's something for you to research

675
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,720
something to google

676
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,400
but also you should create an anonymous

677
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,080
survey like one that is actually

678
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,679
anonymous because the thing that you

679
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,159
should know is that

680
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,559
insecure we're kind of paranoid and so

681
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,080
one of the things is that even if you do

682
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,000
create an anonymous survey we may think

683
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,240
that you may be trying to track us in

684
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,520
our opinions and thoughts and we're

685
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,520
worried about losing our job so it's

686
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,200
really important is to actually create

687
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,200
an anonymous survey and just have it

688
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,120
open where people can drop

689
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,720
um and and write comments or suggestions

690
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,240
the thing is is that we need to do

691
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,159
better when it comes to feedback a lot

692
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,640
of times when we give feedback to hr

693
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,960
they don't take initiatives or they'll

694
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,200
do like this kind of like half approach

695
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,279
of initiative or an action and that's

696
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,240
not

697
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,919
helpful

698
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,840
so the one of the things is that if you

699
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,080
are asking for people suggestions and

700
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,320
you're asking for advice you need to

701
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,960
listen and take actions

702
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,600
ignoring it is not going to do anything

703
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,840
by being a good manager if you are a

704
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,679
manager it's about

705
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,919
wanting to see your team members go

706
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,720
beyond you you are a mentor you are

707
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,840
their coach

708
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,080
you are supposed to provide directions

709
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,640
and you know help them through their

710
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,000
career

711
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,440
and so that's why it's really important

712
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,679
that we start owning that part

713
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,279
and lastly i want you all to remember

714
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,200
when we work together and listen to each

715
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,520
other magic does happen when we work

716
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,919
together making sure people get personal

717
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,000
time off without them fearing of taking

718
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,039
time

719
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,559
you know away

720
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,960
we're then becoming collaborative

721
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,960
and when we collaborate we reduce the

722
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,200
stressful items that hold back the team

723
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,360
from like really thriving

724
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,039
and when we focus on balancing work and

725
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,360
personal life for everyone that's when

726
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,799
we no longer have the dumpster fire

727
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:59,279
because burnout is a security concern

728
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,080
if we don't treat it

729
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,919
and it is uh something that we need to

730
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:04,799
treat

731
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,480
because we're all human and a human

732
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,320
element rules in the world that we live

733
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,039
in and whatever you do and whenever in

734
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,640
doubt just remember

735
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,919
if new zealand can plan well so can you

736
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,159
because in all of us there's a frodo

737
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:19,679
who's on a journey to get rid of a

738
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,840
malicious threat

739
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,640
so overview of this entire conversation

740
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,960
is burnout places you and your team at a

741
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,720
huge risk

742
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,399
collaborate to form strategies to

743
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,039
improve the team that's what you should

744
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,520
be doing right now start making plans

745
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,360
and revisit your security response plans

746
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,120
if you have them making sure that

747
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,039
they're on point

748
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,760
and up to date is really important and

749
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,840
promote self-care by being kind and

750
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,200
respectful to boundaries that means

751
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,279
if you need to get a hold of an employee

752
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,760
and it's not urgent send an email and

753
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,919
remind your employees that when you send

754
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,159
emails it's not urgent

755
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,320
that when it is urgent it should be a

756
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,799
text message this is something that is

757
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,399
really important that we practice that

758
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:07,039
means also slack don't be using slack

759
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,360
after work hours and we also have to

760
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,679
enforce those boundaries as well

761
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,159
because if we are not balancing our work

762
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,159
life and our personal life we become our

763
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:18,559
job and then we lose who we are i think

764
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:19,919
that's a lot of reasons why we get

765
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,440
burned out

766
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,960
because we forget that we're more than

767
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,679
just our job

768
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,080
so i just want to say thank you guys so

769
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,799
much for having me um

770
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,200
and you know i'm here to answer any

771
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,039
questions that you have and once again

772
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,559
thank you to the conference for having

773
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,880
me i try to wrap this up a little bit

774
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,799
faster because i didn't know how much

775
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,720
more time that i would have but i do

776
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,120
know that usually this talk does

777
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,520
bring a bunch of questions so i'm happy

778
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,840
to answer any questions and if you are

779
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,440
uncomfortable asking any questions feel

780
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,320
free to dm me on discord or on twitter

781
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,720
instagram and linkedin my dms are always

782
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,720
open and thank you all for existing

783
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,679
i'm going to stop sharing my screen

784
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:28,640
all right

785
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,679
um

786
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,520
let's do this i see some questions

787
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,720
coming in

788
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,440
so let's do this all right ray asked a

789
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,360
question which is can i put an out of

790
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,279
office alert on my email all the time

791
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,880
not just one out of the office or is

792
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,960
that a bit much this is a great question

793
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,880
you want to know how i deal with this is

794
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,039
that i use like account i block my

795
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,279
mondays and fridays so no one can book

796
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:52,399
meetings

797
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,440
period and the reason i do that is that

798
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,159
i

799
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,480
want people to know that those are my

800
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,799
days to pick and choose whether or not i

801
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,600
have a meeting or whatnot

802
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,600
now if you are going to take time off

803
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,760
it's really important that you know talk

804
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,200
to your manager about it make sure your

805
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,360
team is all okay on it

806
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,440
but when you take that time off so if

807
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,240
you are burned out the only way to help

808
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,200
reset that is by taking time off and i

809
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,679
usually recommend about a week

810
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,600
if you have a more severe case taking

811
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,039
two weeks off is

812
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,240
pretty good

813
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,840
so having one week is kind of like a

814
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,240
quick refresher um but when you do take

815
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,799
off that week make sure that you

816
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:35,520
like turn off all devices don't check

817
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,600
your work email don't do anything on

818
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,200
social media literally take a week off

819
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,720
from social media because social media

820
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,440
is also contributing factor of your

821
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,440
mental health sometimes so it's

822
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,520
important for us to reset that by

823
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,200
disconnecting to reconnect with

824
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,600
ourselves so that means like not doing

825
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,120
anything infosec that means when you're

826
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,559
taking that week off that means not

827
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,000
studying for anything or learning the

828
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,399
latest technique or tools like just

829
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:01,039
don't take that week to like learn how

830
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,519
to play the guitar or something or learn

831
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:04,799
how to paint

832
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,039
um that's really important for you to do

833
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,960
now when you do take that time off make

834
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,559
sure that in your your calendar that you

835
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,640
when the day you come back is blocked

836
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,799
off so no one can set meetings so right

837
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,559
when you start

838
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:21,039
um i mean right when you are setting

839
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,200
your calendar invite for going out of

840
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,120
office make sure you give yourself an

841
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,039
extra day so say for example if you're

842
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:29,279
coming back on the 23rd say that you're

843
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,840
coming back on the 24th in your email

844
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,919
and this is a way for people not to

845
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,159
expect a fast response giving you a

846
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,000
couple days of catching up

847
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,919
um but also that when you come back to

848
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,760
work you're gonna be fly with an inbox

849
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,880
it's also important to let your

850
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,720
colleagues know that you're not gonna be

851
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,919
able to look and go backtrack and slack

852
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,080
that they should see you in every email

853
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,200
that's something about your

854
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,120
responsibility or your duties for your

855
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,080
role

856
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,000
and you'll be able to then know what to

857
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,360
prioritize when you get back because

858
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,039
you're going to come back to a flooded

859
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,960
inbox let's be real

860
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,799
and in this you'll be able to go through

861
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:05,039
on the day when you get back now the

862
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,880
other thing you should do is send an

863
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,559
email to your entire team members asking

864
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,960
them you know right after like an hour

865
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,559
two you've gone back and you're in your

866
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,159
inbox

867
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:17,279
asking

868
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,840
what is needed within the next 24 hours

869
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,679
is there anything that needs to be a

870
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:23,360
high priority

871
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,960
this is good for you to know right when

872
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,640
you come back so you know what you need

873
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,880
to work on and and then the emails can

874
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,480
wait but you want to try to generally

875
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,799
catch up on your emails within the first

876
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,640
two days of coming back so that gives

877
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,880
you some clean way of not having any

878
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,799
needs on the first day but also making

879
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,720
sure that no one has expectations that

880
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,840
you're not going to respond to any

881
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,200
emails until the day after you get back

882
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,320
so those are some good tricks to learn

883
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,399
um let's see what other questions do we

884
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:51,519
have

885
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,120
um

886
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,159
okay

887
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:55,120
when you

888
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,120
do go on vacation

889
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,039
how do you get others to respect it and

890
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,880
not load you up with tons more tasks

891
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,720
when you reach it

892
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,480
i love this one um okay so

893
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,480
one thing to note is that there's a huge

894
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,159
chance you're going to return to a

895
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:11,679
dumpster fire

896
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,840
because that's just how security is so

897
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,519
the one thing is that when you're caught

898
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,679
up and you've had like that week of like

899
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,840
detoxing from everything

900
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,039
um

901
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,799
you feel better like you can actually

902
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,960
handle things and so when you get more

903
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,640
tasks when you get back you'll actually

904
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,559
be able to handle it mentally a lot

905
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:29,679
better

906
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,360
because when you're burned out you can

907
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,519
just push things all the time like

908
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,120
deadlines

909
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,200
give yourself extensions

910
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,600
and sometimes it takes you like an hour

911
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,360
to complete a project when in reality it

912
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,200
used to take you like 10 minutes to

913
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,960
probably complete that project so you're

914
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,559
going to work a lot faster so it's not

915
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,640
going to impact you as much

916
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,480
but also to note like

917
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,960
once again to do what i kind of shared

918
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,880
about when you're taking time off how to

919
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,360
do it in a way where it actually helps

920
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,720
you a lot or gives you about you know

921
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,159
two days of being able to catch up

922
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,000
that's going to help you a lot to do

923
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,560
some stuff like that it does reduce the

924
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,440
anxiety and the anxiousness

925
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:16,000
um what other questions do we get here

926
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,839
um okay um any thoughts on handling

927
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:21,520
working hours with the international

928
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,280
team

929
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,239
so

930
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,679
one of the things that i would say is

931
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,199
that when you're dealing with different

932
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,280
time zones it's important to actually

933
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,000
recognize who's on what time zone this

934
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,599
is one of the reasons why i'm not the

935
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,079
biggest fan of slack sometimes because

936
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,800
people tend to message off hours

937
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,560
so what would be a cool idea that you

938
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,639
can do is to talk with your team members

939
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,399
to find out what times that they

940
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,480
actually work i know that sounds really

941
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,560
strange but the reality is not all of us

942
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,679
are

943
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,639
early morning birds i don't remember the

944
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,000
word for that but

945
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,280
um we're not all very early um some of

946
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,680
us actually are more like night owls we

947
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,520
prefer to work more at night because we

948
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,079
feel more creative at night so one thing

949
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:06,000
that i always talk about is that i feel

950
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
like companies can do a better job by

951
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,160
having more flexibility with ours like

952
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,440
having that set time for everyone just

953
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,880
puts everyone into a huge bucket and

954
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,800
that doesn't work

955
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,480
um so one of the things is to

956
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,880
acknowledge this problem the other thing

957
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,400
is to just look at on what hours work

958
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,000
best for everyone

959
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,920
so finding there might be a sweet spot

960
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,640
that there's two hours every day that

961
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,640
everyone on your teams no matter where

962
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,040
they're located is the best that's the

963
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,400
best time to set up those group calls

964
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,400
and remind people that if they need to

965
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,800
have a whole team meeting that these are

966
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,520
the two hours every single day during

967
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,079
the week that works the best

968
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,079
i think that's really helpful

969
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,160
but yeah also you know you can add time

970
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,520
zones to calendars that also helps

971
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,839
a lot

972
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:03,680
what other questions do we get

973
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,320
how does self-study come into play when

974
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,000
trying to maintain a work and life

975
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,280
balance

976
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,119
this is a great question um i myself i

977
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,760
am a constant learner so i am taking

978
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,000
courses always i'm always wanting to

979
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,599
learn something new

980
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:24,640
but i have to admit sometimes i dread it

981
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,800
and because i don't have the energy or

982
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,280
i'm not passionate enough about it but i

983
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,680
also know i want to do these things

984
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,440
so i think it has a lot to do with

985
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,599
balancing your work and personal life

986
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,119
but the other thing is that when we're

987
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:39,119
burned out it's very hard that even when

988
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,359
it's after work hours to be able to

989
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:44,079
focus on something and we may actually

990
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,320
have like kind of convinced ourselves

991
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,480
that to be able to disconnect from the

992
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,800
world is to watch tv or watch movies or

993
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,160
play video games and that's not

994
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,760
necessarily true um in a sense that you

995
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,280
know

996
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,280
we have to kind of change that mentality

997
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,760
a little bit so say for example what you

998
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,640
can do is you know watch an episode of

999
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,320
tv

1000
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,640
and then reward yourself

1001
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,200
i will not reward yourself but to read a

1002
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,520
chapter in your book or whatnot and then

1003
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,240
uh reward yourself with another tv show

1004
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,320
this is one way how to do it um and this

1005
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,560
is actually a really helpful approach if

1006
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,400
you are someone who has problems

1007
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,720
focusing for long periods of time

1008
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,880
is to do kind of one hour block so one

1009
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,440
hour you focus on one area the next hour

1010
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,680
you focus on a different area and then

1011
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,000
so on um especially if you're one of

1012
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,040
those people that hyper focuses um

1013
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,480
when you're passionate about things and

1014
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,160
only when you're passionate about things

1015
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,520
usually when we're studying we're not

1016
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,280
always a hundred percent passionate

1017
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,040
about it so it's really good is to kind

1018
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,960
of like focus on studying for one hour

1019
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,960
take a break for one hour and go back to

1020
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,440
staying for an hour or study something

1021
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,920
new in your book that kind of like off

1022
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,240
and on kind of thing it does help if you

1023
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,720
can't hyper focus on one thing for a

1024
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,359
period of time

1025
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,520
um

1026
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,200
all right

1027
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,119
how do i get through my thick skull that

1028
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,200
burnout is real and i'm not immune and i

1029
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,359
tend to be worse about it than my

1030
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:12,560
employer

1031
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,480
this is a great question because for the

1032
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,839
longest time i always thought that my

1033
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:19,839
personality is that like

1034
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,520
that i could just keep going and going

1035
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,520
and going and what ended up happening

1036
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,359
was that for two and a half years i

1037
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:27,680
didn't take a single day off

1038
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,760
i made it not a single day off for two

1039
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,960
and a half years and i was going to

1040
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,839
conferences i was going on weekends to

1041
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:35,040
conferences i would go to three

1042
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,520
conferences in a week and fly across the

1043
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,680
world to do these things and i just

1044
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,839
thought that i was immune to it as well

1045
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:43,760
but not really immune i just knew that i

1046
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,440
just need to catch up on sleep at some

1047
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,640
point

1048
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,599
um but it does catch up on you and when

1049
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,760
it does catch up on you it kind of feels

1050
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,599
like it's overnight sometimes or it just

1051
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,440
sneaks up on you or you suddenly realize

1052
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,079
oh my god

1053
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,320
maybe i've been distracting myself this

1054
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,119
entire time and i've been burned out

1055
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:04,160
and i've been

1056
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,640
like trying to you know

1057
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,320
pretend i'm not one of those people

1058
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,640
that's burnt out but i totally am so i

1059
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,960
mean the thing is is that

1060
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,119
it's really important is to understand

1061
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,760
that when you are not having

1062
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,839
self-awareness of how you're feeling and

1063
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:22,000
dealing with situations you're going to

1064
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,240
have these type of problems

1065
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,640
and no one is immune to this i'm going

1066
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,880
to be honest every single person has

1067
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,839
been burned at at some point in the past

1068
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:32,880
year

1069
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,800
um and many of us are still burned out

1070
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,119
right now so just think about it that

1071
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,520
way is that no one is immune to it if

1072
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,520
anything you will have burnout at some

1073
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,119
point and this pandemic really shows

1074
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:47,280
that just note that like you have to be

1075
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,280
understanding of your symptoms so like

1076
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,680
journaling once in a while really helps

1077
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,040
understand what's going on so if you

1078
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,599
ever feel trapped that's one thing

1079
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,520
if you feel empty that's another thing

1080
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,280
if you're feeling overly anxious or

1081
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,400
you're feeling sad frequently or angry

1082
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,400
frequently that's something to

1083
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,839
understand

1084
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:06,960
if you're having

1085
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,800
problems falling asleep or staying

1086
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,800
asleep the whole night

1087
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,400
these are some signs

1088
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,040
the other sign is i've noticed that

1089
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,280
when you drink extra caffeine so for

1090
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,800
example if i'm drinking more than one

1091
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,400
cup of tea a day

1092
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,079
that's letting me know i'm starting to

1093
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:23,680
go into burnout

1094
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,280
and this is actually very common we tend

1095
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,520
to reach for caffeine to like keep us

1096
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,079
going because we feel so exhausted

1097
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:32,319
and it may be a temporary trick but it's

1098
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:34,240
not actually working as well as you

1099
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,520
think it is

1100
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,760
um the other thing is to acknowledge if

1101
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,920
you're drinking more this is another

1102
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,480
thing to notice um is that for example

1103
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,319
if you're drinking every single day even

1104
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:47,680
just a glass of wine or a beer a day

1105
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,680
you need to acknowledge that

1106
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,400
that's going to be a bad thing you don't

1107
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,160
want to create a routine of drinking

1108
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,920
every single day even if it's just one

1109
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,440
drink

1110
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,599
that's something to be aware of a lot of

1111
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:01,680
times where when we're stressed or

1112
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,200
burned out

1113
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,920
you know we'll use marijuana more often

1114
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,079
will drink more often and these are

1115
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:10,800
things of escaping in a sense so we have

1116
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,680
to also recognize that also by eating

1117
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,520
you'll be you know whenever we stress

1118
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,599
we'll either reach for like the junk

1119
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:20,400
food we always reach for the junk food

1120
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,000
and so like you'll crave something

1121
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,400
that's salty or sweet we don't care

1122
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,240
about our health as much and that's

1123
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,680
another thing so when we're not

1124
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,440
appreciating who we are and not

1125
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,200
balancing that that's going to be a huge

1126
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,960
problem

1127
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,000
but yes everyone gets burned out you're

1128
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,680
most likely you could be burned out

1129
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,920
right now it's just been recognizing

1130
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,480
that and understanding that these little

1131
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,800
things do add up

1132
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,760
uh

1133
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,760
why did you decide to give this talk

1134
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,680
what was your inspiration what made you

1135
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,760
want to give this talk

1136
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,880
um so before the pandemic happened

1137
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,079
um

1138
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,000
yeah like literally that year i

1139
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,800
basically was realizing that a lot of

1140
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,560
people in the hacker community

1141
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,079
kept saying that they're burned out or

1142
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,480
they're tired or they feel trapped or

1143
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,280
they feel unappreciated and it really

1144
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,640
acknowledged that we have a mental

1145
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,440
health problem in our industry and our

1146
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,520
employers are not caring

1147
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,319
about it so i actually was on a panel uh

1148
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:21,200
with mental health hackers um at besides

1149
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,240
sf

1150
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,119
uh

1151
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:25,920
in 2020 actually and we talked about

1152
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,160
this and i realized that okay we need to

1153
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,560
have an actual talk just on burnout

1154
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,440
because i'm afraid that if we have a

1155
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,160
pandemic we're going to get really

1156
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,160
really bad here

1157
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,160
and when the pandemic hit that's when i

1158
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,319
recognized okay i need to start creating

1159
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:44,400
some talks around burnout

1160
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,920
because that's really important for us

1161
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,440
to do

1162
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,920
and so basically that's what i did i

1163
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,000
kind of created this

1164
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,880
this talk about how you can

1165
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,040
work with having burnout how you reduce

1166
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,920
burnout how do you fight burnout how to

1167
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,760
recognize burnout so i started giving

1168
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,440
that talk last year and then i also

1169
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,680
realized that

1170
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,280
i'm not going to fix

1171
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,359
things in a big way unless i start

1172
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:11,599
talking about how this industry it just

1173
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:12,800
makes it

1174
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,119
happen over and over and over again and

1175
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:16,640
we're not solving it we're just talking

1176
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,960
about it but we never take action and so

1177
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,960
i want this talk to be like that i want

1178
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,880
us to have these conversations i want to

1179
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,480
open that door for us to have

1180
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,880
conversations on how do we improve this

1181
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,359
industry that was created in a way to

1182
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:31,359
cause burnout

1183
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:34,480
so that's why i created this talk

1184
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,800
i think that's all the time that we have

1185
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,440
for for q and a like

1186
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,560

1187

00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:45,599
