54

uh a big thank you to security mods for

56
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,800
sticking around and making sure

57
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,920
everybody's uh safe welcome and uh you

58
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,239
know everything's going well in the in

59
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,920
the discord um

60
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,000
139 stickers were exchanged in our in

61
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,560
our great sticker exchange channel

62
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,160
uh we also had 130 memes ship posted in

63
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,080
the meme span channel

64
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,239
uh all in all uh we were able to find

65
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,360
that there were around 23 000 messages

66
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,680
sent which means on average for all the

67
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,239
people in lobbycon there are about 30 or

68
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,280
so 30 36 messages sent per account so i

69
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,599
have to imagine uh that that actually

70
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,840
gets to around 60 each of us all sent

71
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,120
around 60 messages to each other

72
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,560
at some point or another during the

73
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,720
conference so not nearly as great as

74
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,800
last year last year i think we went into

75
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,280
the hundreds of thousands of messages

76
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,159
sent

77
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,879
so you need to work on your game folks

78
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,840
uh let's see here we had 27 talks 12

79
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,360
training sessions

80
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,400
uh and we also had nine minutes missing

81
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,879
from ray redacted's keynote that's known

82
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,280
as the secret nine minutes

83
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,080
uh and i'm very sad to say we did not

84
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,280
have any ms paint entries and uh

85
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,480
it was uh it was very very dismayed to

86
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,319
hear that because we actually we

87
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,000
actually had a really awesome price for

88
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,720
that

89
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,680
uh the prize the prize for that one was

90
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,200
going to be a geforce 3080ti

91
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,680
oh my gosh

92
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,599
you missed out on it so now we're gonna

93
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,519
have to actually take that uh and

94
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,440
because we're now becoming a non-profit

95
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,840
we have to put it towards the activity

96
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,080
of the conference so

97
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,319
we're deciding to open up a circle city

98
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,840
coin and we're going to start mining it

99
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,159
just for ourselves and uh you know we're

100
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,519
gonna we're gonna raise money for the

101
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,760
con that way so in a way you ended up

102
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,920
helping us by not participating in the

103

107
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,599

of

135
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,320
so we had a lot of entertainment uh we

but having that audience feedback uh

148
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,120

morning

182
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,039
it's just a little bit ago it feels like

183
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,199
it was forever but it was just this

184
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,319
morning that we had a brunch there uh we

185
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,720
have gimli who created i believe it was

186
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,199
uh roast beef hash with uh

187
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,800
um uh

188
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,440
cornmeal hotcakes with some uh with some

189
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,199
blue cheese on top so that was really

190
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,000
great uh it looks like uh sam craven

191
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,880
with his engraved knife or laser etched

192
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,440
knife there made for us some huevos

193
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,840
rancheros

194
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,000
and i would say that

195
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,080
we i will say that we did raise a

196
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,160
thousand dollars during

197
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,080
that brunch uh we got over the thousand

198
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,319
dollar mark thanks to some uh

199
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,240
some cocktail con donors that wanted to

200
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,120
see sam craven suffer

201
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,440
so sam craven invented probably one of

202
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,759
the worst drinks ever which is called a

203
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,160
bloody milordie which is pretty much

204
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,639
what it sounds like bloody mary made out

205
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,360
of jepson's malort

206
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,039
so everyone from chicago knows what

207
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,400
we're talking about and just kind of

208
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,960
threw up in their mouth um and everyone

209
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,199
else who doesn't know what it is

210
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,199
you have been spared from a fate worse

211
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,960
than death

212
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,360
so want to thank gimli and sam for some

213
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,680

had been working on one puzzle one

384

puzzle the entire conference uh and uh

385
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,959
it was

386
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,279
involved writing c code and trying to

387
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,880
subvert the amgr bina binary analyzer

388
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,959
and none of that was in his wheelhouse

389
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,399
and he solved it an hour after the ctf

390
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,040
ended time well spent

391
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,279

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,200
helping out uh blindster with bringing

499
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,520
the hardware hacking village to us we

500
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,160
also had a tool and the lock picking

501
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,160
village so we hope you learned a lot

502
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,559
from the various demos and

503
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,320
trainings and little little learning

504
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,120

want to thank our opening keynote ray

506
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,960

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,679
history of hacking in 3 000 seconds

508
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,760
sans the secret nine minutes which

509
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,919
actually we still were recording i

510
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,240
believe so i think you should be able to

511
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,919
actually see that on youtube if you

512
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,440
missed those nine minutes during the

513
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,039
great discord outage of uh 2021

514
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,200
you will be able to see it

515
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,120
later this uh later in a couple weeks

516
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,120
whenever we do upload that to uh to

517
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,240
youtube

518
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,400

closing keynote who i

520
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,440
if you could tell i just threw these

521
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,440
together at the last minute because that

522
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,000
still says opening keynote

523
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,600
instead of closing keynote it's not a

524
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,919
circle citycon closing ceremony unless

525

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,440
ear worm and not an earworm that you're

uh also one dark one for the logo and

560
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,480
art that you see that you've seen

561
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,080
throughout the conference

562
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,320
uh and also lickety we've had great

563
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,840
streaming staff and there's been plenty

564
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,440
of streaming staff who have streamed but

565
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,880
uh they all over in shifts

566
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,640
but uh lickety uh essentially has uh was

567
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,400
kind of forced to go and stream the

568
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,159
entire conference due to some technical

569
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,960
difficulties we had uh and lickety was

570
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,960
sticking through it the entire time and

571
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,000
uh and essentially hosted the stream for

572
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,600
us the entire time so i want to thank

573
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,240
him for uh jumping in there and and

574
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,840
helping out there

575
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,120
so

576
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,000
what about

577
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,200
2022 i'm happy to say we're going to be

578
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,640
physical

579
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,159
we're going to get physical we're still

580
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,000
going to have some virtual elements

581
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,320
um and you're going to have the ability

582
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,400
to still tune in to what's going on if

583
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,400
you can't make it to the conference

584
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,240
so there's still going to be that but

585
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,240
we're going to really go physical this

586
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,280
time uh and really bring it back for you

587
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,200
i think everyone's going to be ready to

588
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,360
join the conference i think everybody's

589
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,000
tired of staying at home

590
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,600
um so

591
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,679
in a year it's going to be enough time i

592
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:14,880
think that everyone's going to be very

593
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,039
happy to get back out again and we hope

594
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,880
you'll choose circle city con as your

595
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,520
con to go and um if you do one con a

596
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,520

597
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,720
city con is your con to get physical

598
