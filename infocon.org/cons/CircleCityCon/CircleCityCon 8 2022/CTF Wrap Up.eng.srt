let's see number two

49
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,960
for

50
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,600

there's a re challenge and i'm gonna go

52
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,520
over some of the challenges and kind of

53
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,680
uh how you can if you if you

54
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,360
participated and you solved a bunch of

55
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,799
stuff then that's awesome if you

56
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,320
participated and you didn't solve a

57
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,160
bunch of stuff then we're going to

58
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,919
publish most of our write-ups so

59
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,440
hopefully people will be able to take a

60
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,319
look at those kind of learn

61
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,160
either where they went wrong or anything

62
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,920
that they were missing from their skill

63
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,599
set so i'm going to

64
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,160
go through go through some of where to

65
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,760
find that stuff uh here in a minute

66
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,440
all right so

67
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,400
second one is uh

68
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,080
this one might look familiar to some

69
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,519
people this one is also from

70
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,440
super helpful i t

71
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,239
and this is a submission for a

72
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,080
reversing challenge which is interesting

73
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,400
usually we see usually we see all a's

74
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,319
and the pwn challenges but not so often

75
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,000
for reversing so

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,440
i thought that was pretty funny thought

77
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,080
that was pretty good and then finally

78
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,160
we do have a challenge called easy as

79
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,360
pie

80
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,480
and our our favorite submission for that

81
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,280
one

82
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,400
was

83
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,120
just the string pie from number wang so

84
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,319
good guess

85
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,840
it's not the flag and it's not in the

86
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,319
format but we love to see it you know if

87
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,920
you can guess it right off the bat no

88
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,400
need to solve the challenge

89
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,440
all right so um we saw some other fun

90
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,480
submissions from funny submissions uh

91
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,440
like don't be shy have a slice uh for

92
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,200
easiest pie not in the not in the

93
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,519
format um so you know scrolling through

94
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,360
the logs it's nice to be it's nice to be

95
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,760

submissions so there wasn't a whole lot

104
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,239
of there wasn't a whole lot of messing

105
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,000
around in the in the flag submissions

106
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,280
but you know

107
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,799

after the ctf this is actually under

172
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,560
um nsnc on discord's

173
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,479
account because we needed private repos

174
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,080
for it um

175
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,560
but all of our source code and all of

176
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,560
our solutions will be here so for

177
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,639
example if you were working on a phone

178
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,880
challenge uh let's go ahead and just

179
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,120
look at on cdn

180
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,520
so under each challenge we'll have

181
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,240
deploy which is all the files that we

182
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,160
use to deploy the challenge on our

183
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,759
server so

184
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,440
generally that's going to be

185
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,520
under docker so we use docker compose to

186
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,919
deploy all our stuff

187
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,680
so that way it's super easy for us we

188
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,919
just log in we do docker compose up and

189
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,919
there bada bing bada boom we've got our

190
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,759
challenge running on the right ports on

191
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,520
the right you know interfaces all of

192
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,120
that stuff

193
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,000
all right

194
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,759
so that's what'll be in the deployed

195
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,520
directory for each one

196
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,479
we also have dist which is distribution

197
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,560
this is what you as a player got so we

198
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,360
have a description which is exactly what

199
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,000
was pasted into our web interface and

200
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,400
then we usually have you know if it's a

201
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,680
phone challenge it'll probably have the

202
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,080
binary crypto challenges will have you

203
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,400
know your encoded or encrypted strings

204
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,840
etc

205
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,639
so

206
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,400
go ahead and and

207
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,240
just make sure that those you know match

208
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,800
if you're if you're if you're not sure

209
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,919
sometimes we may have re-uh

210
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,759
uploaded some of the challenge files and

211
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,039
they may be different so if you have

212
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,879
them downloaded from when you're playing

213
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,879
use the ones you downloaded because we

214
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,319
we may have changed it but you should be

215
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,319
able to figure out um

216
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,960
which one is correct then we've got uh

217
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,479
probably the most important part the

218
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,479
solve so

219
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,000
in some cases this will be a python

220
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,680
script in some cases it'll be a full

221
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,039
write-up

222
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,319
you're welcome to ping any of the ctf

223
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,319
overlords slash me

224
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,199
um on discord and we will

225
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,039
try and explain the write-up if if

226
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,879
something's not clear in it some of them

227
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,240
are a little short because we developed

228
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,720
the cpf on a pretty fast timeline so you

229
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,720
know there were some corners cut

230
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,280
admittedly but um

231
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,120
in all cases there should be a solution

232
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,599
so for example this one is a python

233
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,200
script and it kind of just has a little

234
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,839
bit of comments on

235
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,958
uh how it works basically you know here

236
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,200
i say what's the what the solution is

237
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,519
but you know we recognize that this

238
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,880
isn't super clear and sometimes people

239
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,640
like to ask questions so feel free to

240
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,800
hit us up on discord and we'll be happy

241
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,080
to walk through stuff with you and then

242
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,920
finally probably the most important part

243
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,160
is the source code so for each challenge

244
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,000
you know we'll have your c source code

245
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,839
or your javascript source code whatever

246
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:02,880
it may be

247
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,399
um

248
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,760
and so you can go ahead and actually

249
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,480
look at what code we wrote to make the

250
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,240
challenge that you're playing so

251
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,160
hopefully that'll be helpful for people

252
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,080
we want to get more people interested in

253
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,600
ctf more people uh you know get this

254
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,519
kind of skill set because hey it's super

255
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,320
valuable employers really love it

256
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,320
hopefully you will love using it because

257
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,279
it

258
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,240
is a lot of fun and b just because you

259
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,720
know having solutions available makes

260
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,040
everybody better right so we we believe

261
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,640
very strongly in getting solutions out

262
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,760
to everybody uh when possible obviously

263
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,120
sometimes time constraints and other

264
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,959
things make it hard but

265
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,480
we do our best so there may be one or

266
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,480
two challenges that don't have write-ups

267
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,000
those will hopefully have write-ups

268
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,399
within the week and if not and you're

269
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,399
specifically interested in something

270
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,360
feel free to reach out

271
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,519
so again that will all be here and this

272
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,000
repo will be made public as soon as

273
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
nathan goes ahead and does that so

274
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,920
you'll be able to find all of the all of

275
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,600
the challenges all of the solutions and

276
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,600
all of the source code here you can

277
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,440
run the challenge on your own to your

278
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,399
heart's content and solve it or you know

279
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,079
if you're into making challenges you and

280
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,360
you want to try that out you've got the

281
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,360
source code you can extend it you can

282
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,800
use our phone challenge template we

283
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,120
found that works really well so

284
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,920
hopefully that is helpful for people so

285
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,040
let's see

286
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,880
let me take a look at the twitch chat

287
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,040
did anybody have any

288
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,079
questions on ctf challenges how to make

289
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,440
ctf how to play ctf any specific stuff

290
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,060
feel free to drop those in chat if not

291
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:41,040
[Music]

292
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,320
i may

293
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,640
end a bit early because i actually don't

294
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,399
have anything else everybody did a

295
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,000
really good job with the ctf and we

296
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,519
think it

297
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,320
hopefully was pretty fun

298
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:05,440
[Music]

299
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,320
