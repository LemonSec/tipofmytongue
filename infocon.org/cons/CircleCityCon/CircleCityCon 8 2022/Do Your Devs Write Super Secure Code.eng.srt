2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,599
wow

3
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,480
welcome everyone to are your developers

4
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,359
super secure coders

5
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,640
my presentation today will be discussing

6
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,880
are your projects discussing secure

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,120
coding throughout all phases of the

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,440
software development lifecycle

9
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,800
and are your developers super secure

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,399
do they have all the tools they need to

11
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,440
be super

12
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,360
topics discussed will be

13
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,239
throughout do your teams use

14
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,199
secure coding guidelines best practices

15
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,719
secure coding standards and checklists

16
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,959
and do they use them throughout their

17
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,880
agile team meetings

18
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,000
as well as we will be discussing secure

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,159
coding training and certifications

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,000
my background

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,200
is a

22
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,159
secure

23
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,479
cyber engineer at raytheon in

24
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,000
indianapolis and i've worked there for

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,360
30 years

26
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,080
i have a masters in cyber security and

27
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,640
two certifications in secure cutting and

28
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,360
i'm working on my third

29
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,000
i use

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,880
secure coding frameworks and

31
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,520
sca tools and help teams to analyze

32
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,720
issues

33
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,360
i also give training on the sca tools

34
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,159
and help programs with secure coding and

35
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,079
help them to understand how to use those

36
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,079
tools and how to use secure coding

37
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,399
okay um let's get a little bit of a

38
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,880
background everybody understands

39
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,719
actually how to use cure coding and

40
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,040
all of the terminology you've heard

41
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,280
these things but actually do you know

42
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,560
how to use them or how to actually

43
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,840
include them in all phases of your

44
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,440
coding or secure coding

45
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,840
projects

46
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,760
let's let's start at the beginning

47
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,120
design phase

48
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,120
let's how to use let's learn how to use

49
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,680
a guideline

50
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,440
first of all

51
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,360
each project can actually create their

52
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,800
own guideline

53
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,160
it depends on your type of organization

54
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,319
each type of organization is different

55
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,360
so your guideline will be different too

56
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,959
depending on the type of software you

57
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,120
develop and the type of languages you

58
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,920
use

59
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,000
your guideline will be different there

60
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,360
too

61
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,040
um

62
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,239
you can give different genera

63
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:55,440
generalizations depending on your coding

64
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,920
style and it will also

65
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,000
help you with usability

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,640
and readability so your guidelines will

67
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,920
help with each of those phases if you

68
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,040
need

69
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,440
different

70
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,840
different languages

71
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,319
we all understand different languages

72
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,159
can get very

73
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,599
complex

74
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,480
so making them more usable and

75
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,720
understandable and readable

76
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,680
is

77
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,000
for for future people picking up your

78
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,120
code

79
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,040
um trying to

80
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,720
take code that someone who's now

81
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,799
left the company and then trying to have

82
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,519
a new user read it

83
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,560
if you have code that is to spaghetti

84
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,159
code

85
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,480
no somebody can't do that but using a

86
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,640
coding guideline that everyone writes

87
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,400
code in the same way

88
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,400
that is why you need coding guidelines

89
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,840
secure coding examples code should not

90
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,159
be too difficult to understand again

91
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,640
that's why you need them code should be

92
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,400
well documented

93
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,120
why are you doing something in a in this

94
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,239
manner

95
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,319
um length of function still make your

96
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,599
function like

97
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,519
200 lines

98
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,159
everything should be simplified make it

99
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,440
the as small as possible make it the

100
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,519
simplest function that you can be

101
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,320
don't have like i said 200 lines

102
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,880
don't use go to statements because first

103
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,520
of all when you go to try to debug after

104
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,040
it's broken

105
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,160
okay

106
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,639
how try to debug something

107
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,240
when you have go to statements that's

108
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,280
almost that's that's so hard when you

109
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,280
try to use a compiler with the go to

110
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,840
statement and when you try to use the

111
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,960
static analysis tool on a good two

112
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,040
statement it's gonna fail

113
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,520
your static code analysis state your

114
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,320
your sca tools are gonna say uh uh no go

115
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,080
to statements are bad

116
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,040
so

117
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,199
yeah your your coding guidelines are

118
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,199
probably going to say try not to use

119
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,520
them unless absolutely necessary

120
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,360
advantages of using

121
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,680
coding guidelines

122
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,280
you you're going to have

123
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,600
more efficient code because everyone

124
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,759
codes in the same manner

125
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,479
your user your your users are going to

126
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,639
have better and more efficient code

127
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,560
because you can have someone pick up the

128
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,440
code

129
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,000
and say hey i can actually fix this

130
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,919
because i understand it

131
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,600
if you have everybody write code in a

132
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,960
different manner

133
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,360
it's going to have a little bit harder

134
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,880
for someone to pick up someone else's

135
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,199
code you have a peer review it's going

136
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,360
to be harder it takes time to go back

137
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,919
and do a peer review if everybody writes

138
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,759
code in a different manner

139
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,880
so

140
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,720
you know it's kind of hard

141
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,360
it reduces development time again

142
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,600
because everybody writes code in the

143
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,320
same manner development's going to be

144
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,840
faster because

145
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,800
you can fix things quicker everybody's

146
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,880
looking at the same code

147
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,120
same manner your development time is

148
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,039
going to be a lot faster because

149
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,960
hey everything's

150
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,720
easier to find

151
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,919
and

152
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,360
you can you can detect errors quicker

153
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,919
because more things are more organized

154
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,759
if it's if you're using a coding

155
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,240
guideline

156
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,840
okay best practices

157
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,919
best practices um are used because it

158
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,400
makes things more rule compliant that's

159
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,080
what it best practices

160
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,199
there's also things in a in a best

161
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,160
practice that use things more like many

162
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,560
types and variations of standards and

163
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,520
guidelines so things that are best

164
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,960
practices

165
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,400
are for like rules and guidelines that

166
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,039
are no i shouldn't say guidelines here

167
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,080
rules

168
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,039
um

169
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,360
for coding standards let's go to that

170
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,080
one

171
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,400
um commenting and documentation again

172
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,360
again fall in here but it's consistent

173
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,360
indentation

174
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,319
consistent naming schemes so everyone

175
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,240
might name the same way

176
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,240
if you have every

177
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,319
variable

178
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,919
of a certain

179
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,160
type i know this might go back to the

180
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,319
way we used to do it when i first

181
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,639
started coding

182
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,240
um all numerics started with an n

183
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,759
um i know it's that's way way back there

184
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,240
but i know it made it a lot easier to

185
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,080
know that it was an numeric

186
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,400
okay

187
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,800
all

188
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,199
integers started with an i things like

189
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,919
that hey

190
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,240
avoid deep nesting don't have if then

191
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,759
else if then else if then else um

192
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,720
your

193
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,560
again your static code analysis tool is

194
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,080
going to catch that

195
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,560
and it will actually say hey some of

196
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,520
these ifs don't actually go anywhere

197
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,879
these these are never going to get

198
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,199
caught

199
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,680
sometimes people put if

200
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,039
in and they are never actually used

201
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,240
so make sure that you're actually using

202
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,720
all of those if thens so make sure your

203
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,160
deep nesting is actually a useful code

204
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,440
uh limit line length um

205
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,759
make sure that when you have

206
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,400
your code don't in don't have all of

207
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,080
your code actually on one line i know

208
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,240
that some languages allow you to

209
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,719
actually have your whole statement on

210
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,320
one line

211
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,719
but then go and try to debug that

212
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,320
when you have an error

213
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,519
um

214
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,839
yeah that's not pretty

215
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,440
um

216
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,360
so make it so that it's a little bit

217
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,839
more usable

218
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,360
another best practice yes capitalized

219
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,839
sql special

220
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,040
awards not everybody does that it's just

221
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,160
good practice best practice

222
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,800
um other best practice

223
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,880
don't use magic numbers okay come on

224
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,480
we all do it

225
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,120
i've i remember doing it in the old days

226
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,720
i had a program that said no do that

227
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,760
put the put it at the top assign it to a

228
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,640
variable make sure you comment say this

229
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,519
is why this number is here

230
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,480
and

231
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,800
that way if you come back later and you

232
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,040
need to change it you know why that

233
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,600
variable that magic number is in your

234
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,160
code because if you if you just assign a

235
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,040
number

236
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,959
inside your code

237
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,480
and somebody needs to change that

238
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,399
variable for some reason

239
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,080
they don't know why that number that

240
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,000
variable's there it's just a magic

241
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,160
number where that number got pulled out

242
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,760
of a hat somewhere

243
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,720
nobody knows where that number came from

244
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,080
unless you

245
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,399
comment put a comment in there saying

246
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,560
that's what this number means

247
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,720
assign it to a variable

248
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,360
put a comment say what this magic number

249
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,480
means

250
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,360
but don't just put a variable or just

251
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,240
don't put a magic number in your code

252
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,279
um validating your input oh my gosh

253
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,240
really

254
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,200
always

255
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,880
validate your input from external

256
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,160
sources

257
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,680
that is like the best practice ever

258
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,440
always validate

259
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,640
always

260
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,600
because you never know where that that

261
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,480
variable that that value is coming from

262
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,440
always validate

263
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,959
and error handling and logging okay

264
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,640
we all should have error handling and

265
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,360
logging but do we

266
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,760
your static analysis tool is going to

267
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,480
catch you on error handling logging not

268
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,040
so much but error handling it's going to

269
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,720
catch you

270
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,519
and

271
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,320
okay using compiler's highest warning

272
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,680
level

273
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,640
it's not going to static analysis tools

274
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,920
most likely are not going to catch you

275
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,120
on that one

276
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,760
but your security people might catch you

277
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,839
on that one

278
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,560
and denying access by default

279
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,519
that one is also a security

280
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,600
person they might catch you on that one

281
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,640
too but that's the best practice to do

282
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,800
don't allow access

283
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,680
to

284
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,920
functions or areas

285
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,079
unless you re the the software really

286
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,800
needs it or a person needs it deny

287
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,560
access by default

288
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,519
just

289
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,279
only things that need access to a

290
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,120
certain area or if or a person that's

291
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,720
people really

292
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,959
make the software should only have

293
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,839
access to an area if it needs it don't

294
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,000
let your software have access to

295
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,640
everything

296
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,120
okay

297
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,320
some of the best practices mentioned

298
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,880
you can always use a code formatter to

299
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,519
go in and fix some of the formatting

300
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,959
now

301
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,920
code formatters beautifiers these all

302
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,000
can be used on your code

303
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,360
i don't recommend it for some programs

304
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,200
that you just go in and

305
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,560
look just go in and just boldly go in

306
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,239
and co and format your code

307
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,320
i work with code that's been around for

308
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,240
20 years i would not do this on that

309
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,000
no way

310
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,040
because

311
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,920
yes it would be nice to have nicely code

312
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,000
and beautified code

313
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,560
formatting beautified code but

314
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,680
um

315
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,720
i don't know what it would do to it it

316
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,959
truly it might break it

317
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,120
i i don't know

318
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,000
um

319
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
if you're starting out a new program and

320
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,160
you want to use beautifiers or code

321
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,040
formatters on those that's great

322
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,399
it's wonderful

323
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,839
but on

324
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,360
legacy code

325
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,440
i'm not too sure that it would be a

326
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,600
great idea

327
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,399
but things like this it's awesome if you

328
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,399
could do something like this in the very

329
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,959
beginning and start from scratch

330
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,600
because doing a code formatter and doing

331
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,160
a style checker on your code at the very

332
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,920
beginning or

333
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,000
even in the middle if you could

334
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,279
getting this

335
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,120
as something that you could actually run

336
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,360
in your code this would be something to

337
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,079
do in automatic this is this is the way

338
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,200
to go

339
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,959
so these are all

340
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:27,760
um

341
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,519
code formatters this is this is a list

342
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,800
um i was actually given this list and

343
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,800
another presentation when i kind of gave

344
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,600
up

345
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,959
a shrunken

346
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,120
version of this presentation

347
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,680
they gave me they they just started

348
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,720
flying at me all of these style checkers

349
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,880
um so these are our beautifiers style

350
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,519
checkers formatters um

351
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,160
all kinds of different ones so all of

352
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,480
these are beautifiers that can be done

353
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,600
for different languages different code

354
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,240
languages

355
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,240
so these can all be done

356
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,360
and but like i said i do not recommend

357
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,160
them on legacy

358
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,600
for instance this is

359
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,320
unformatted code

360
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,519
all shrunk up

361
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,079
um

362
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,279
not pretty at all

363
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,360
um

364
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,040
it you know

365
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,600
just not pretty

366
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,040
if we

367
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,240
make it

368
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,000
more readable

369
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,120
that

370
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,560
is

371
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,639
better to read and understand and

372
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,079
can follow

373
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,160
that is what we want to see

374
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,320
and understand

375
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,240
so

376
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,279
that's that's more what we what you

377
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,480
would want to see in your code

378
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,839
okay now we get to standards

379
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,360
um

380
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,360
standards

381
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,800
secure coding standards are used to

382
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,800
prevent

383
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,720
vulnerability security vulnerabilities

384
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,560
from getting into our code

385
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,079
now

386
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,440
we all understand the term standards

387
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,920
and i'm sure we we've seen them but not

388
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,560
everybody

389
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,040
uses them or or

390
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,959
knows where they are

391
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,360
so i'm just going to kind of

392
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,600
we're going to follow

393
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,199
um

394
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,480
the the sei secure coding standards

395
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,240
with that we've got the c

396
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,600
um and c plus plus coding standards from

397
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,199
the seo certs

398
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,680
these are they both have downloadable

399
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,639
books

400
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:51,600
at

401
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,560
the

402
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,279
wiki sei site

403
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,360
they also have the

404
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,480
um

405
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,199
the seo security standards for android

406
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,639
java perl c and c plus plus at that

407
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,440
site but this site actually has

408
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,360
standards where you can actually go and

409
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,360
you can actually

410
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,120
look at the standards to understand

411
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,440
and read

412
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,519
what a standard is

413
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,440
how to

414
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,959
look through the code and follow what a

415
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:25,920
buffer

416
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,480
overflow is what to do in the case of

417
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,199
sql injection or

418
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,199
um

419
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,199
i'll actually look at

420
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,000
when you when you actually get into your

421
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,120
code

422
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,560
and say a static code analysis tool and

423
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,839
you see

424
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,320
errors that you don't understand you can

425
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,120
actually go to these standard sites

426
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,600
because the the static code analysis

427
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,279
tool will actually

428
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,680
give you

429
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,720
links to the standards if you've got the

430
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,679
correct checkers

431
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,039
that you could actually go to these

432
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,760
sites and it will actually help you to

433
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,199
fix your problems

434
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,439
and it will actually help you to

435
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,599
understand possibly how to fix your code

436
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:23,039
to make it more secure

437
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,559
these

438
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,360
are like i said that i just gave the

439
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,440
basic

440
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,400
here but these these downloadable books

441
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,280
they are

442
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,760
thick i've got them actually downloaded

443
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,039
because i actually have the cnc plus

444
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,240
plus secure coding

445
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,799
certification for professionals

446
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,840
um certification um so it's i actually

447
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,200
had to download those books because i

448
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,200
had to keep referencing for my

449
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,480
certification

450
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,600
um but that is that's a good place to go

451
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,559
to get

452
00:17:58,559 --> 00:17:59,440
those

453
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,480
those

454
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,120
understanding

455
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,000
we also have the nvd

456
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,720
the national vulnerability database

457
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,440
and that actually is where you can get

458
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,320
an understanding of cves or the common

459
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,960
vulnerability database or exposure

460
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,160
database

461
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,480
and it actually can

462
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,039
get you links to other

463
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:28,080
scoring systems the cvss the cwe's

464
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,400
cpes

465
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,120
those are other vulnerabilities that

466
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,320
allow us to

467
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,400
those vulnerabilities will show up in

468
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,559
tools like

469
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,360
coverity and fortify

470
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,240
and you can actually go to these sites

471
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,520
as well

472
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,000
and it will actually help you to

473
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,360
understand

474
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,880
okay these

475
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,200
vulnerabilities okay

476
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,000
how do i fix these what where do these

477
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,640
vulnerabilities exposures how can they

478
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,480
affect my system

479
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,240
and these will actually give you

480
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,120
platform vulnerabilities as well linked

481
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,400
to your software

482
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,000
how can it affect my platform

483
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,120
then we have mitre the cve

484
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,200
sites it gives you the common

485
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,919
vulnerability and exposures it gives you

486
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:26,400
languages and vulnerabilities and how to

487
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,840
fix them the cves again will be linked

488
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,039
in your static code analysis tools

489
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,919
and it actually can give language fixes

490
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,679
and different different fixes in

491
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,799
language different languages

492
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,200
so you can actually get an idea

493
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,320
how to fix whole

494
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,960
bunches of different ways

495
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,559
um

496
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,440
it's it's a very good tool i mean it's

497
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,559
it's

498
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,039
a lot of different exposures different

499
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,640
vulnerabilities and it does

500
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,480
it gets updated

501
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,200
quite frequently so there's a lot of new

502
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,360
ones coming through all the time

503
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,159
but you can also create your own secure

504
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,960
coding standard um i actually have a

505
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,480
link at the back of

506
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,720
my presentation where you can actually

507
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,760
create your own project specific secure

508
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,640
coding standard where you actually say

509
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,120
we are going to follow

510
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,840
this practice we're going to use

511
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,720
this coding standard um we're going to

512
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,159
use a checklist we're going to follow

513
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,480
these specific

514
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,240
um

515
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,400
top 25 o-wasp we're going to follow

516
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,720
you know we're going to do this we're

517
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,159
going to

518
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,360
do certain things we're going to have

519
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,200
you know links to this

520
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,640
it's it's

521
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,520
pretty

522
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,840
really pretty

523
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,840
good you know

524
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,080
outline where it's

525
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,799
it's got everything laid out and you can

526
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,520
actually just plug and play everything

527
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,799
that your

528
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,840
project depending on

529
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:19,360
your specific needs has and

530
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,840
if you want to include certain

531
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,200
certain things

532
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,919
you can if you don't you just

533
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,799
leave them off the list but it's it was

534
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,280
it i thought it was really really a good

535
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,840
starting point for for a project to

536
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,159
include a secure coding standard that

537
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,159
way but i've got it like i said i've got

538
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,440
it at the end of my presentation

539
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,120
okay and now if we get to secure code

540
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,080
reviews

541
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,840
um

542
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,840
we're going to discuss things like if

543
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,799
you include secure code reviews do you

544
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,480
use sprint planning and do you do manual

545
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,240
code reviews

546
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,840
and i'll discuss what a manual code

547
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,400
review means in this process in this

548
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,600
this meeting

549
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,480
and do you or do you use automated code

550
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,080
reviews

551
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,039
and do you use a tracking tool like

552
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,320
azure in this case

553
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,440
for me a manual code review means that

554
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,360
you

555
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,320
are

556
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,039
actually only reviewing

557
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,520
the code that changed since the last

558
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,720
time that you actually did a review i'm

559
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,280
not talking about a secure code review

560
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,320
in the case of reviewing the code for

561
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,080
vulnerabilities and reviewing the whole

562
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,280
code base

563
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,080
i'm talking about using a secure coding

564
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,200
checklist

565
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,159
i'm talking about checking the code

566
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,320
that has changed and including people

567
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,320
that

568
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,679
are like your domain experts

569
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:56,640
your

570
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,240
you need to include junior code

571
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,520
reviewers

572
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,240
and you need a security professional

573
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,640
um you need someone that can look at the

574
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,679
code that's changed and say hey

575
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,080
you aren't actually following secure

576
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,760
coding practices you might need to do

577
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,159
a little bit more along this list

578
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,320
pathway when you're doing you're not

579
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,799
including

580
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,080
you're not including error handling in

581
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,720
this procedure or where you you really

582
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,400
should because of this you're not

583
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,679
um

584
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:32,960
using

585
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,919
print

586
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,280
f

587
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,120
or s print f when you should be

588
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,239
things like that and

589
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,279
some programs are still in the dark ages

590
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,600
and if they're not using an automated

591
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,320
code review tool things like that might

592
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,720
actually need to get caught

593
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,000
and so

594
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,080
some things that

595
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,760
need to get caught

596
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,679
might need a security professional that

597
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,440
understands some secure code

598
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,320
practices need to be in these reviews

599
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,320
and so if you're just reviewing a

600
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,880
certain part of the code you might need

601
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,799
somebody that understands secure coding

602
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,320
practices

603
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,760
you're not going to like i said you're

604
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,520
not reviewing the whole code review the

605
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,000
whole package um

606
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,559
you're just reviewing what what was made

607
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,200
a code in that change

608
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,440
but if you're making a change to one

609
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,960
piece and

610
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,960
they're already changing that little

611
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,640
piece of code

612
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,039
hey why don't you add this little bit

613
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,120
and this little bit here and make it a

614
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,360
little bit more code more

615
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,918
secure

616
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:49,520
um in the case of pros and cons

617
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,400
um manual code reviews do find

618
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,919
logical logical errors and flaws

619
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,600
that that

620
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,880
can be found in the design and

621
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,279
architecture that a

622
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:05,760
a automated review can't find

623
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,200
and in the case

624
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,320
of

625
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,279
this

626
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:15,840
you also can add experienced eyes like a

627
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,840
person that some of my

628
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,919
some of my projects we've got people

629
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,120
that have been working on some of these

630
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,919
programs for over 20 years so you can

631
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,400
add experienced eyes to some of these

632
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,400
manual code reviews

633
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,080
plus you can add secure coding and ebsec

634
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,400
knowledge to some of these reviews

635
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,120
and have people that do understand

636
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,279
both coding and

637
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,200
absec

638
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,480
knowledge

639
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,200
to these reviews if possible

640
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:50,159
so you can share that with your teams

641
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,600
the only problem is that for the cons is

642
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,400
you do need some experience in both

643
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,320
language and frameworks

644
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,960
and not everybody is familiar with all

645
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,760
of the languages being used

646
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,240
in our case we need people that might

647
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,360
have to

648
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,440
be familiar with going all the way back

649
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,520
to ada

650
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,799
and

651
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:13,760
um

652
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,279
things like that

653
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,919
um you but you do need an understanding

654
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,320
of security so you

655
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,640
we again need we need to make sure that

656
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,080
some of our people do understand

657
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,520
security

658
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,240
we are lucky that some of our people do

659
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,840
some of our developers do understand

660
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,000
security so that is good

661
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,240
um but you do

662
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,720
there is also the problem that if you

663
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,440
don't use a checklist

664
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,000
you might get different reports if you

665
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,159
aren't using the checklist

666
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,120
your manual reviews are going to have a

667
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,880
different look and

668
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,760
so

669
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,600
using a checklist is very good in that

670
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,120
manner you get

671
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,279
a same look

672
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:59,200
from your rev your manual reviews

673
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,440
so a checklist

674
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,240
if you can get one would be should be

675
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,039
like language neutral because

676
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,840
i know some of my programs we've got vb

677
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,159
we've got c we've got c plus plus we've

678
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:15,600
got c sharp

679
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,120
in one program

680
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,039
so if they could be in language neutral

681
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,520
their checklist could be used all across

682
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,679
the board

683
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,919
offer a plan of approach to review the

684
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,840
code changes

685
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,679
make sure that they know at the very

686
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:30,640
beginning

687
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,320
their approach this is what we expect

688
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,320
this is what we're expecting out of the

689
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,760
review

690
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,080
and we don't want anything else this is

691
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,279
what we expect out of this review

692
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,640
and just say we expect it to take this

693
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,440
long and that's it kind of like a sprint

694
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,960
planning review

695
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,240
this is

696
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,080
we aren't going to take any longer than

697
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,919
this this is all we're going to take

698
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,679
don't don't take any longer when you're

699
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,799
doing when you're doing your checklist

700
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,880
only take this amount of time

701
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,960
and so

702
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,360
including include an amount of time on

703
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,799
your checklist

704
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,679
so sections on a checklist can include

705
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,000
things like exception handling do they

706
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,559
do they have exception handling in

707
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:17,520
in your

708
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,679
your the code that was changed do they

709
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,880
do they include auditing

710
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,600
so does does

711
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,799
the error

712
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,840
in the error handling does the error

713
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,760
fail securely does the auditing do they

714
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,840
have enough information to reconstruct

715
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,880
do they have if it's sensitive does it

716
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,760
don't don't log it

717
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,720
for general information

718
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,720
libraries are up to date

719
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,919
you know design sensitive information is

720
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,440
not identified

721
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,399
cryptography

722
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:03,200
sensitive data has been secured

723
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,600
um

724
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,240
a lot of ours is not are not web-based

725
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,159
so we don't really have to worry about

726
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:13,760
that

727
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,840
but store crypto keys securely

728
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,159
input validation that one's a big one

729
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:21,840
for a lot of programs

730
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,679
data is checked for special characters

731
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,799
for before passing to sql yeah that

732
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,520
one's that one should be a big one on

733
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,159
on your checklists input restricted to

734
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,799
only known characters validate numerics

735
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:41,520
authorizations deny access to pages and

736
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,559
data by default

737
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,240
session management

738
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,200
things like that so i mean

739
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,600
you're those are those are kind of

740
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,120
things you should you could have on a

741
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,440
checklist i mean most programs

742
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,880
won't have a lot of those but

743
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,360
there will be some that will have

744
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,000
certain certain things it will depend on

745
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,520
the type of

746
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,080
program again that you have

747
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,919
um

748
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:16,720
we'll

749
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,559
next we'll talk about automated code

750
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,039
reviews okay an automated code review

751
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,880
will be things

752
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,960
that will be run from

753
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,960
tools like

754
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,120
an sca tool things that will be

755
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,480
run

756
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,159
and can do

757
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:38,000
like a um a coverity of fortify can be

758
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,440
can go and do like a nearly fully full

759
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,919
code coverage it can be run during an

760
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,159
automated build and

761
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:47,120
um

762
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,600
i these are the two that i'm mostly

763
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,440
familiar with i know there's a lot more

764
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,559
out there

765
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,960
but these are the ones that i'm i'm most

766
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,399
familiar with

767
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:57,440
um

768
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,399
and then when is best time to do

769
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:05,479
the automated secure code review

770
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,559
do it during your build development and

771
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:09,679
probably

772
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,320
nightly scans are most

773
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,919
the best time to do it

774
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,720
and only when new code is added to cm

775
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,080
because those are the

776
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,440
those are the best times to do it at

777
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,679
least that's when i found to be the best

778
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,640
time to do it is when either when new

779
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,360
code is added or nightly scan

780
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,200
it depends on how much code is being

781
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,000
added to your repositories

782
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,519
um

783
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:40,080
because if you've got a pro a program

784
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,080
that adds a lot of code all the time

785
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,360
then do it nightly but if you have a

786
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,760
repo that is only adding code

787
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:54,240
once a week

788
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,760
once

789
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,840
you know

790
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,880
not even not not even that consistently

791
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,519
then only do it when new code is added

792
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:07,360
so that that can tell you hey just just

793
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,639
do it when new code is added

794
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,760
so

795
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,360
for coverity

796
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,678
it it's basically it can be

797
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,080
it can be run

798
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,240
early in the in in the sds sdlc it can

799
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,760
be tracked across across

800
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,200
application

801
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,840
it is compliance

802
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,039
with security and coding standards

803
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,919
both cyber and software work together to

804
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:38,960
fix

805
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,519
to find and fix the issues

806
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:44,960
and then it supports 21 languages

807
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,360
and you can't really see that screen can

808
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,080
you

809
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,640
um but basically

810
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,120
the the tool

811
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,640
allows you to actually look at the code

812
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,760
find

813
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,640
and

814
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,600
up here in the corner i could actually

815
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,559
hope i can't even show you

816
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,720
but it allows

817
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,360
up here in the very right corner it

818
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,279
allows you to actually

819
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:15,840
look at a cwe and go right to the

820
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,679
the actual cw

821
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,519
website

822
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,440
so you can actually pull

823
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,519
the information for it

824
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,000
fordify

825
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,720
also allows you to find the root cause

826
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,039
of security vulnerabilities

827
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:34,080
and you can actually

828
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,360
sort by the severity get guidance and

829
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,240
how to fix them and then cyber and

830
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,320
software can work together to fix those

831
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,640
issues it can actually provide support

832
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,840
for 26 languages

833
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,200
and then

834
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,640
it's actually

835
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,799
able to work

836
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,120
with all these different

837
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,840
both third-party binary web

838
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,399
and mobile

839
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:06,640
but you can also use sca tools on the

840
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,280
desktop we have coverity working on

841
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,639
desktop

842
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,000
and

843
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,399
we have developers that can find and fix

844
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,879
coverity issues or security issues

845
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,839
earlier in

846
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:22,000
the the sdlc base

847
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,320
the stlc

848
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,719
and they can actually

849
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,480
if they find them earlier before they

850
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,520
actually get put into the repo

851
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,119
they can actually

852
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,918
stop them from actually

853
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:37,918
getting into

854
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,960
the pipeline and

855
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,879
that actually saves time and effort

856
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,280
so we were trying to actually

857
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,440
stop new issues from being injected

858
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,359
so

859
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,679
that's helping us

860
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,240
slow down that process

861
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,520
of getting

862
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,280
of getting new

863
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,400
issues

864
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,960
plus that allows them to actually fix

865
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,320
more issues

866
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,440
they actually fix issues and then if

867
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,240
they find more issues around

868
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,720
the issue that they were already fixing

869
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,640
they can fix more issues at the same

870
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,879
time

871
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,760
so um automated code review pros they

872
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,560
can

873
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,680
fix or they can detect low-hanging fruit

874
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,040
and

875
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,400
lots of vulnerabilities

876
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,359
all at the same time

877
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:36,560
they can

878
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,160
run

879
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,040
tests quickly and lots and lots of

880
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,079
code

881
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,240
it can be done in an agile and

882
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,800
continuous integration

883
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,480
it can be scheduled and run on demand

884
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,280
and then tools can be customized and it

885
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,200
is compliant for the the different

886
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,200
standards

887
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,720
um cons it does provide false positive

888
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,760
and negatives although

889
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,200
[Music]

890
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,119
truthfully i

891
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:08,400
i have

892
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,440
found a lot of false positives at least

893
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,560
not in the recent years

894
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,160
um early early on when we first set it

895
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,720
up we did find some but

896
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,800
in the recent years we haven't found as

897
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,480
many um

898
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,480
it is dependent on the breadth of the

899
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,359
tool

900
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:30,960
so um

901
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,160
again we're using coverity a lot fortify

902
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,079
we haven't really

903
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,880
set up for a lot of programs yet at

904
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,160
least i haven't haven't had access to it

905
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,520
um

906
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,680
i haven't played with it much

907
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,079
um learning curve for those not familiar

908
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:51,119
with the seo sea checkers yeah there is

909
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,480
a learning curve for for using the tools

910
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,680
um of course i've been using it for

911
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,240
10 years

912
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,160
and it is not viable for everyone

913
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,079
but there is

914
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,520
open source

915
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,839
so

916
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,839
it is possible for for those that want

917
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:15,279
to use open source versions

918
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,440
code quality

919
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,000
you can use code quality tools to find

920
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,680
code quality issues within your

921
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,520
compilers

922
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,680
and issues can be found and can be can

923
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,480
make better quality code

924
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,520
now static code analysis

925
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,320
tools do find code quality issues but if

926
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,960
you use a code quality tool

927
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,640
early and fix the code quality

928
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,520
issues first your static code analysis

929
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,280
tool

930
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,440
you know find less quality issues hint

931
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,520
use the code quality tools

932
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,320
at

933
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,000
the same time

934
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
with your static code analysis

935
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,200
you might fix

936
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,160
fix the issues early with center cube

937
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,079
and style cop and you would have less

938
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,680
static code analysis issues

939
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,040
anyway

940
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,320
so if you

941
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,359
use

942
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:20,160
code quality tools your results can also

943
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,359
be used during the manual code review

944
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:24,960
um

945
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,160
so sonar cube is one of those code

946
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,599
quality tools and it can find

947
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,040
um

948
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,480
issues those quality issues and it can

949
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,720
find it can be used on 25 different

950
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,960
languages

951
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,200
but it breaks down

952
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,240
those

953
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,520
issues as bugs errors that can break

954
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,000
your code vulnerabilities

955
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,280
it says

956
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,520
it's open to attack

957
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,640
and

958
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,079
code smells

959
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,119
and it says issues that are makes your

960
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,359
code confusing

961
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,599
so that sounds like it really is a

962
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,079
quality

963
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:11,640
and it looks something like this

964
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,119
and it can be used for

965
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:19,359
java c-sharp

966
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:22,560
c c plus plus cobalt even anybody go

967
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,279
back to coball days

968
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,680
style cop

969
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,599
can be set up to run

970
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:37,119
for example during a visual studio build

971
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,880
and it's also good quality and can be

972
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,720
run automatically

973
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,599
through tfs jenk or jenkins

974
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:46,640
and

975
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,480
i've actually got some programs that are

976
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,280
doing this and it can be run in desktop

977
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,839
mode also through your visual studio but

978
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,960
like i said it can actually be set up to

979
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,240
run through

980
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,560
either desktop or through the visual

981
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,480
studio

982
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,800
and automatically through azure

983
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,200
but i've got it i've got a couple

984
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,440
programs running it automatically now

985
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,400
through

986
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,319
azure

987
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:13,760
but you get

988
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,520
example

989
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,079
for example c sharp

990
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:19,359
and you get

991
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:22,160
something like this

992
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,319
file hit or missings

993
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:28,880
closing brackets it depends on how

994
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,880
you've got it set up

995
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,079
but

996
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:34,640
for example this one just had 12

997
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,640
warnings

998
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,440
and if you click on the one warning you

999
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,680
can actually get some additional

1000
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,119
information

1001
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:49,200
and i'll tell you exactly

1002
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,399
the cause the rule description

1003
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:03,759
and for training

1004
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,440
these are all different

1005
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,680
secure coding trainings that are

1006
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,119
available

1007
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:11,280
you have the certified secure software

1008
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,800
lifecycle professional the csslp

1009
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,520
which is the the one

1010
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,359
training that i'm actually working on

1011
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:20,960
right now

1012
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,680
the secure coding and java professional

1013
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,280
cert from sdi secure coding in java

1014
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,720
defending web apps security essentials

1015
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,480
from sans

1016
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,040
secure coding and cnc plus plus and then

1017
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,520
the secure coding and cnc plus

1018
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,000
professional certificate which is what i

1019
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,319
have

1020
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:47,359
and then there's a game

1021
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,760
secure code warrior has a secure code

1022
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,520
training game

1023
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,400
and

1024
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,599
you can actually go out and get a demo

1025
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:56,560
um

1026
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,079
license of it

1027
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,839
and it's it's actually a pretty awesome

1028
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:02,880
game um

1029
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,760
you basically are going

1030
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,880
it's

1031
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,480
there's a whole lot of different

1032
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,560
languages that you go from one

1033
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,359
one

1034
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:15,680
place to another to another to another

1035
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,079
and it's

1036
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,400
um basically they tell you find the

1037
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,440
error

1038
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,400
or the bug in this piece of code and you

1039
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,920
have to go from

1040
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,240
one piece of code find the bug to this

1041
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,880
piece of code find the bug find this bug

1042
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,920
find this book and once you pass an

1043
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,119
in

1044
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,119
one level you go to another level to

1045
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,839
another level you get points on the

1046
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:40,960
board

1047
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,119
and you are trying to

1048
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:46,319
beat adversaries and so forth it's it's

1049
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:47,680
kind of like a

1050
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,720
kind of like i capture the flag but

1051
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,359
something like kind of like that but it

1052
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:55,599
it's really really cool

1053
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:57,599
um so

1054
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:58,480
it's

1055
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,880
it was kind of neat i started playing it

1056
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,280
but i was also trying to get ready for

1057
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,599
presentation so i didn't get to play for

1058
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,800
very long

1059
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,760
before my demo

1060
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,599
went expired so

1061
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:15,760
but it was it's pretty pretty awesome

1062
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,240
so

1063
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,520
basically

1064
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,480
um

1065
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,640
calling all superheroes wanting just

1066
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,280
make sure that everyone tries to make

1067
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,280
sure that all of their developers are

1068
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,280
super secure and tried to make sure that

1069
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,520
i included everything i could

1070
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,759
to

1071
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,680
to just

1072
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,240
make sure that everyone knew where all

1073
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,160
of the

1074
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,119
places in your development life cycle

1075
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:45,280
you could include secure coding

1076
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,640
practices

1077
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,839
where what a

1078
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:53,280
what phases everything could be secured

1079
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,319
and add secure coding practices so thank

1080
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:57,520
you very much

1081
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,800
thank you for attending my presentation

1082
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,880
if there's any questions

1083
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:09,640
i need to go to discord for that

1084
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,040
so

1085
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,480
