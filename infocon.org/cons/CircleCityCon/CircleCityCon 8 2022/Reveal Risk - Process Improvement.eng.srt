circle citycon live this time we have a

4
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,039
very special guest here uh as you know

5

reveal risk and we have michael milroy

7
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,800
here from reveal risk uh to talk about

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,320
it's not about the tools it's how you

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,360
use them

10
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,640
uh michael has grown his professional

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,480
acumen through the u.s marine corps

12
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,559

24
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,240
classes we hope you'll welcome

25
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,199
michael milroy

26
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,680
thanks appreciate it um

27
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,680
so yeah today i just kind of wanted to

28
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,119
talk about process improvement for for

29
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,119
me i i grew up in tech

30
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,119
and then i kind of veered away once i

31
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,200
got out of the marine corps and landed

32
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,119
in project management got really big

33
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,079
into

34
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,920
business process improvement

35
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,439
and then i was also able to uh kind of

36
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,560
bring my my cyber skills back up to date

37
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,439
um

38
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,119
and then i found myself in a really

39
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,520
interesting crossroads of trying to get

40
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,759
back into tech and cyber security

41
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,880
specific

42
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,360
um but i had these process improvement

43
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,200
skills and

44
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,560
you know to me it's all about how can

45
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,000
you be more effective but also more

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,040
efficient

47
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,880
so

48
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,119
i fortunately was able to find reveal

49
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,560
risk and one of the things they were

50
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,679
looking for was someone who was

51
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,760
tech savvy but also

52
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,400
able to speak business you know so

53
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,959
talk business to business and i t to it

54
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,520
and then kind of help

55
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,280
bridge those two

56
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,680
departments there so

57
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,280
i've been able to do that here

58
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,200
throughout the bmv throughout reveal

59
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,000
risk and now i'm just kind of gonna

60
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,599
throw this out have a little bit of a

61
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,640
discussion here today with this um

62
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,400
because i feel like

63
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,920
intentional process improvement is

64
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,000
something that is kind of lacking in

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,879
tech in general uh cyberspace cyber

66
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,640
security specifically

67
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,400
um you know and there's so many tools

68
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,599
out there

69
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,440
that it kind of just seems like oh we

70
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,879
have a problem there's probably a tool

71
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,400
for it let's put this tool at it and

72
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,400
then move on to the next problem

73
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,400
um so i kind of just want to go over

74
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,319
that go over some of the things that are

75
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,560
out there current practices

76
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,000
get into process improvement and then

77
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,120
kind of

78
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,120
tie it all back together with

79
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,480
you know what what should this mean for

80
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,159
the industry uh what are some things we

81
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,040
can do

82
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,120
to focus process improvement within

83
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,760
cyber and stuff like that so

84
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,079
uh

85
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,720
let's see

86
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,120
so here we go process improvement in

87
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,879
cyber security again my name is michael

88
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,560
milroy and i'm currently a consultant

89
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,959
and service delivery lead at reveal risk

90
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,319
so some of the things we're going to go

91
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,200
over uh we have the you know just high

92
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,720
level cyber security stack

93
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,720
a lot of people are familiar with it but

94
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,400
kind of what is it what's the importance

95
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,000
what are some of the tools

96
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,840
high level overview and lead into the

97
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,400
current top tools high level overview of

98
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,680
process improvement and some of the

99
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,080
common methodologies and then

100
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,599
dive a little bit deeper into the

101
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,439
importance of process improvement but

102
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,439
then also kind of step

103
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,120
step down a little more detailed and

104
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,239
look at what are some of the general

105
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,439
tools and techniques but without saying

106
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,519
you know oh i'm doing this particular

107
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:08,879
methodology

108
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,239
because anyone can use process

109
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,959
improvement without having to commit or

110
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,920
swear to a specific methodology this is

111
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,600
no like flavor of the month or anything

112
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,759
like that this really is about what are

113
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,759
some tactical tangible tools we can use

114
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,360
to get real results

115
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,479
um

116
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,479
kind of

117
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,680
no games so and then we'll again we'll

118
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,040
kind of end here with what does this

119
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,240
really mean for the industry

120
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,440
so cyber security stack

121
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,560
this

122
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,240
you know as most of you know this really

123
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,280
is just

124
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,440
really any tool that kind of feeds in

125
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,120
and helps

126
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,880
the company with their security policy

127
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,800
and their cyber security

128
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,080
just some of the

129
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,720
general components here we have mdr your

130
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,960
managed detection response

131
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,360
vulnerability risk management a sim tool

132
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,360
anti-virus incident response digital

133
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,039
forensics

134
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,520
identity access management

135
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,080
the stack is just how how you

136
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,160
bring all these components together and

137
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,520
ensure that they're

138
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,280
you know working effectively and

139
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,360
interacting properly together

140
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,360
so that you can provide the best

141
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,639
coverage for your organization as

142
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,039
possible

143
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,600
so a typical approach um these are just

144
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,919
kind of if and statements right so if

145
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,720
we're recently breached oh well clearly

146
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,280
you need digital forensics because

147
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,560
you've been breached we need someone to

148
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,520
go through

149
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,199
actually analyze all those logs and look

150
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,120
through everything to figure it out

151
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,199
oh you need import protection okay well

152
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,360
mdr does that uh but wait there's this

153
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,600
new thing called xdr which is like mdr

154
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,600
but on steroids so let's throw an mdr

155
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,880
tool at it

156
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,240
you don't have a security operations

157
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,320
program well why don't you consult that

158
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,759
out to a third party risk management

159
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,280
firm and they'll do it they'll they'll

160
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,199
help you out there too

161
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,199
do you need a cyber focus leader well

162
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,840
there's virtual csos so you know you

163
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,080
don't have to go and hire

164
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,319
a ciso on your own you could just bring

165
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,000
one in temporarily again help with that

166
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,400
security operations program

167
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,919
uh do you want to practice incident

168
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,840
response well there's a thing out there

169
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,240
called wargaming yet another tool so

170
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,840
it's kind of just

171
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,319
uh i just want to focus on

172
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,560
hey this is what i think my problem is

173
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,440
and then our typical approach is okay

174
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,840
well here's a tool for it

175
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,840
um but i really want everybody to think

176
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,800
a little bit deeper than that here

177
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,000
so

178
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,360
some of those tools that we kind of just

179
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,720
talked about

180
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,319
for this one all i did i just went out

181
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,479
to gartner and just looked specifically

182
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,800
at their mbr service market and i just

183
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,520
pulled a couple off the top 40 list so

184
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,080
this is no specific order or you know

185
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,759
branding or promoting or anything here

186
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:48,479
but

187
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,800
um fireeye i think most people familiar

188
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,520
with that we got blue voyant rapid7

189
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,319
arctic wolf sentinel one elementrix

190
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,599
critical start

191
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,199
um if you guys are familiar with these

192
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,000
tools you know a lot of them are mdr but

193
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,440
then they also have

194
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,680
um other services with them incident

195
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,440
response

196
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,240
uh log analysis log aggregations and

197
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,280
tools

198
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,159
things like that so

199
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:15,919
just a couple of the tools that are out

200
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,159
there

201
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,120
but

202
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,280
i want to spend more time focusing more

203
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,080
deep than just the tools itself so

204
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,759
with process improvement we really want

205
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,280
to hit on what is it and why should

206
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,520
anybody care

207
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,120
and i probably get a little too excited

208
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,080
about process improvement and uh kind of

209
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,639
um may push pretty hard on this i know

210
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,800
especially with like some of our clients

211
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,639
and then my time at

212
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,960
the indiana b and b

213
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,720
because there's always a better way to

214
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,039
do it and if we don't know what we're

215
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,160
fixing

216
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,879
then you know how can we fix it properly

217
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:51,680
um

218
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,520
metrics are also another big thing here

219
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,360
if you don't met you can't you can't

220
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,520
improve what you don't measure

221
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,039
so all of these are kind of just looking

222
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,199
past the surface here

223
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,120
so with process improvement we we want

224
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,720
to kind of focus on closed-ended

225
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,800
questions i know this first one's not a

226
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,280
question but i kind of start here with

227
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,199
have you guys ever heard hey stop

228
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,039
treating the symptoms of the problem and

229
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,680
identify and treat the actual problem

230
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,919
i have a cough the doctor could give me

231
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,080
cough drops you know that subdues the

232
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,000
cough but the underlying problem could

233
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,919
still be there

234
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,639
same kind of thing here so a couple of

235
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,680
tools and we'll dive more deeply into a

236
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,000
few of these here but what's the problem

237
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,559
like what is your real problem statement

238
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,479
and this should be carefully crafted in

239
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,080
a way that you can look at it and you

240
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,120
can see

241
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,360
um

242
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,159
like a distinct breakdown of

243
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,600
you know here's my actual project so i'm

244
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,560
not just

245
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,080
um

246
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,160
man we have weak security

247
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,600
okay that's not really a problem that's

248
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,920
more of a statement um can't really fix

249
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,800
that

250
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,040
until you know what specifically is weak

251
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,480
about your security right

252
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,200
so

253
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,560
one of the things we can do here it's

254
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,800
called a 5y analysis

255
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,720
just keep asking why what's the problem

256
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,399
well we have weak security

257
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,240
okay well why do you think you have weak

258
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,440
security

259
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,920
um well we only have antibiotics we

260
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,360
don't have any other tools okay well why

261
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,360
do you only have any buyers well we've

262
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,959
never had a budget to do anything with

263
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,839
that uh anything beyond that okay well

264
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,279
why have you never had a budget well no

265
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,040
one's ever asked for a budget increase

266
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,839
so as you can see like if you just ask

267
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,600
the simple question of why

268
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,320
you just kind of keep going and then

269
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,839
eventually you'll get the actual root

270
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,120
cause of the problem

271
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,600
um typically speaking it's you know four

272
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,760
or five times if asking why and you'll

273
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,000
get either at or very close to the root

274
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,200
of the problem

275
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,560
if you get to well i don't know that's

276
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,760
just how it is

277
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,839
um

278
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,839
uh or well that's because of this other

279
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,279
problem then you've kind of hit that

280
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,600
bottom of the barrel there and we either

281
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,000
need to take that as the root cause or

282
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,760
if it's another problem then switch and

283
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,320
focus to that one

284
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,240
another thing here that we see a lot of

285
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,959
times is responsibilities uh well who's

286
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,600
responsible for performing that

287
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,800
um

288
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,720
log analysis isn't getting done uh we

289
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,360
have mdr but there's no threat hunting

290
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,320
um

291
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,240
we have antivirus but no one's even

292
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,160
patching that okay well let's ask the

293
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,200
simple question of well who's

294
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,480
responsible for performing that

295
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,519
because if you don't know who's

296
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,440
responsible for it then you can't hold

297
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,440
anybody accountable so another simple

298
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,640
tool here

299
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,200
a racy chart raci responsible

300
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,839
accountable consultant inform this is a

301
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,399
very simple tool uh just used to kind of

302
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,120
break down what are all of our tasks

303
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,120
and then who are all the people on the

304
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,320
team

305
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,839
and then you just fill that little

306
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,160
matrix in there so you can clearly see

307
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,240
hey this person's responsible for doing

308
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,000
the work this person's head is going to

309
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
roll if it's not done

310
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,079
i need to seek input from this

311
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,160
stakeholder and

312
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,680
this executive over here just needs to

313
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,600
be informed of hey things are moving

314
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,040
well hey we hit a roadblock hey we're

315
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,880
done

316
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,120
uh that also goes into who's held

317
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,720
accountable here to ensure it's done who

318
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,480
are the stakeholders

319
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,040
uh another big thing that you know

320
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,920
it used to just be business and i t of

321
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,920
hey what other systems does this impact

322
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,839
business make it makes a change doesn't

323
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,519
consult i.t

324
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,000
boom our systems are down uh

325
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
they the diversions no longer interact

326
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,360
together

327
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,440
or we lose compatibility but then you

328
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,800
also have

329
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,680
i.t you know ops and security

330
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,000
uh security makes a patch but that patch

331
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,079
isn't compatible with the version of a

332
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,360
software or

333
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,519
an os version that we have so now we're

334
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,959
down again right so now we're eating

335
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,440
ourselves from the inside here

336
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,000
so communication

337
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,279
uh who else needs to know about this

338
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,800
project this kind of goes with with the

339
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,360
one before of

340
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,440
uh hey you know security is making this

341
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,120
change but what other systems is it

342
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,279
gonna impact who else should we talk to

343
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,040
and say hey we're doing this can you

344
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,399
think of any ways that this would impact

345
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,480
someone else

346
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,399
process improvement another big piece

347
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,240
here is what's your sla your service

348
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,920
level agreement

349
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,680
if i'm running an mdr

350
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,639
and i have an sla of responding in three

351
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,920
minutes to

352
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,160
any verified threat

353
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,160
but i'm not i'm not meeting that i'm at

354
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,519
three and a half minutes i'm at four

355
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,480
minutes

356
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,399
um well one you need to know what your

357
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,959
sla is and two you need to know how long

358
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,440
it's currently taking you so metrics are

359
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,320
all encompassing here

360
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,240
because you know that's a big deal if

361
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,160
you're not meeting your sla that is a

362
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,120
very

363
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,079
critical

364
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,760
area for

365
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,160
immediate process improvement and then

366
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,519
another big thing here is what does the

367
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,320
process look like end to end um but

368
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,920
again i think i'll go into this one here

369
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,720
in a bit but um process maps kind of

370
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,959
just squares triangles you have you know

371
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,800
flows typical flowchart if anyone's

372
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,720
familiar with that

373
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,000
but if you can look at your whole

374
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,680
process then you can actually you know

375
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,839
see every step every system that's

376
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,519
included

377
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,560
you can you can even go as far as to get

378
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,399
durations and wait time between and once

379
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,760
you start building out these process

380
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,160
maps with more and more detail

381
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,880
the the waste the inefficiencies and

382
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,200
effectiveness the gaps all of these

383
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,160
things

384
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,000
are just like glaring problems when you

385
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,399
actually see it on paper

386
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,320
and then you can work from there to

387
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,440
actually figure out okay well let's

388
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,959
focus on

389
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,200
step three first because step three is

390
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,200
holding up everything else down the line

391
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,480
so we really need to get that and then

392
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,079
we'll kind of you know adjust and begin

393
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,680
methodologies uh so again some common

394
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,680
approaches and their focus here um

395
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,920
i'm not i'm not here to say any one of

396
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,920
these is better than the other i've used

397
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,120
i've used and still use all of these

398
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,800
you know it always depends on the client

399
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,600
or it always depends on the need

400
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,880
but i don't want anybody to get caught

401
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,360
up on well he said use six sigma or he

402
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,680
said lean or

403
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,120
well don't use any of that you really

404
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,880
just you know none of that let's just

405
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,720
focus on hey here's some examples some

406
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,440
terminology that you're going to see

407
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,199
they all have their pros and cons and

408
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,959
they all have their specific use cases

409
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:11,920
so

410
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,240
lean i think by now most people are

411
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,480
probably familiar with lean lean six

412
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,399
sigma six sigma

413
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,440
um

414
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,680
lean focuses on reducing waste there's

415
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,760
eight kinds of voice some say seven

416
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,600
depends on the

417
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,680
visual that you look at

418
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,120
but

419
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,720
um

420
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,639
you know what are some like hey this

421
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,279
takes too long to do hey we made 100

422
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,079
when we only needed to make 20 widgets

423
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,959
um

424
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,880
kind of finding those areas where you're

425
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,240
you're over producing you're under

426
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,320
producing you're taking too long that's

427
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,839
what lean's about let's find those and

428
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,440
let's reduce those

429
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,760
six sigma is more about variation in a

430
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,399
process uh you know if i'm making let's

431
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,639
just say i'm making a cheeseburger and

432
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,480
every cheeseburger needs to be cooked

433
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,560
medium rare it needs to have onion

434
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,800
lettuce tomato pickle ketchup and

435
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,839
mustard

436
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,000
okay well if hamburger one or

437
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,680
cheeseburger one comes out just like

438
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,040
it's supposed to be cheeseburger two

439
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,079
comes out

440
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,000
it has no tomato okay well that's

441
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,320
variation cheeseburger 3 comes out it

442
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,720
has no lettuce or tomato

443
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,560
cheeseburger 4 comes out and all of a

444
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,160
sudden we have mayonnaise on there so

445
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,360
those are the variations in the process

446
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,639
in the output

447
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,440
so six sigma says hey

448
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,760
let's figure out why there's variation

449
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,680
is it the same person making all these

450
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,040
and they made an error because that's

451
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,079
training

452
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,000
do we have six four people making

453
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,440
cheeseburgers and they all work out

454
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,519
differently okay well now we need to

455
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,360
again train but make sure everyone's

456
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,000
trained to the same standard

457
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,839
so that's that's kind of lean and then

458
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,480
six sigma lean six sigma is just an

459
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,040
all-encompassing way to take

460
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,440
take both of those because a lot of

461
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,800
times if you're finding waste and you

462
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,120
reduce waste that's going to impact the

463
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,480
amount of variation that you have in

464
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,000
your process

465
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,600
and vice versa

466
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,000
kaizen cousin's really interesting and

467
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,560
this is a really intense one

468
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,560
it is also focused on finding and

469
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,040
reducing waste but at a super high level

470
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,759
there are kaizen events that can be

471
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,440
like a full day

472
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,040
they could even be three to five day

473
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,959
events where a company basically just

474
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,600
like shuts down an area everybody comes

475
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,000
and they map their process into and they

476
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,839
look at every aspect of it and they

477
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,240
literally just brainstorm and fix things

478
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,639
right there on the spot

479
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,440
so

480
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,680
kaizen's great it utilizes a lot of

481
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,639
other sub sub methods and sub techniques

482
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,360
but that one's not always for everybody

483
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,240
process mapping value streams

484
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,600
these are things that aren't necessarily

485
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,600
methodologies but there are specific

486
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,720
things that

487
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,279
kind of cross methodologies here

488
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,800
process mapping we have this little

489
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,680
visual down here of

490
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,440
uh you start at this green circle you

491
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,199
move on you do a task you move to the

492
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,440
diamond this is a decision so do i do

493
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,240
path a and go up do i do path b and go

494
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,519
down

495
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,279
that's all the process map is this makes

496
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,359
it easy to see the process end to end

497
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,280
value streams very similar but you're

498
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,359
looking more at

499
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,839
what's what's your business's focus

500
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,799
so if you have like a retail portion a

501
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,559
manufacturing portion then you're going

502
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,480
to map those out specific to each of

503
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,559
those focuses

504
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,839
the pdca cycle plan do check x

505
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,439
another simple methodology but this

506
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,520
one's even more simple of

507
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,000
you know you plan it you make a plan you

508
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,880
do you actually test it out you perform

509
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,679
it

510
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,760
check let's go back and monitor let's

511
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,320
make sure that what we did gave us the

512
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,720
result we wanted and then act is

513
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,360
improved um hey it didn't give us

514
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,039
exactly what we wanted we need to tweak

515
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,799
it and then we'll do it again

516
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,799
hey it did give us what we wanted okay

517
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,559
now let's roll it out beyond a pilot and

518
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,840
let's start full implementation

519
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,039
poke yoke

520
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,799
poke yoke and go to the gimba these are

521
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,559
probably two of my uh

522
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,520
two of my most favorites here um one

523
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,880
they're great to say and most of the

524
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,120
time people have no idea what you could

525
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,679
even be referring to um but these are

526
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,480
also like six sigma kind of focus items

527
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,280
here

528
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,000
poka yoke is one of the it's basically

529
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,520
mistake proofing

530
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,120
so how can i

531
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,760
how can i build a process that prevents

532
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,440
anyone who does it doesn't matter who

533
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,360
they are how much training i have they

534
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,679
literally can only do it one way uh a

535
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,520
simple way to do this let's think of

536
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,440
your outlet you know

537
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,000
a typical plug has

538
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,360
the

539
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,760
the wider prong and then the skinnier

540
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,919
prong well you can only put that plug in

541
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,840
there one way

542
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,679
it's mistake proof if you turn it around

543
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,360
it's not going to go in

544
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,039
um

545
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,720
so there's this kind of that this this

546
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,760
helps with

547
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,760
processing setup operations or

548
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,360
measurement errors you know you prevent

549
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,440
those missing parts wrong parts but you

550
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,799
can't have those because you only give

551
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,480
them what they need

552
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,240
um

553
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,039
and then let's see go to the gimbal this

554
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,120
is this just means go to where the work

555
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,240
is done

556
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,080
if you're high level management go to

557
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,480
the gimba for you that means go down to

558
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,280
the manufacturing line go down to the

559
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,840
the help desk go down to the site and

560
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,799
actually see the work that they're doing

561
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,039
because you one if you came from there

562
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,799
you're gonna you're gonna regain the

563
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,400
appreciation that you have you grew up

564
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,960
from there um and even if you don't have

565
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,400
experience you're going to get that

566
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,320
knowledge and understanding and and be

567
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,440
able to

568
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,799
empathize with the people that are

569
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,559
actually doing the work and better be

570
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,400
able to

571
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,720
uh make make changes make improvements

572
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,760
things like that

573
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,080
all right root cause analysis so

574
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,000
again let's step back let's take out all

575
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,440
the methodologies and let's just look at

576
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,000
some things that we can do here

577
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,120
gimbal walks talked with this you know

578
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,039
get reconnected with directly with the

579
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,039
work experienced professors can always

580
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,520
forget what it's like to be a student

581
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,160
high level cyber security executives can

582
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,320
forget what it's like to work in a site

583
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,360
or work as an analyst

584
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,440
it helps you know your workers helps you

585
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,679
get eyes on that end-to-end process gets

586
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,840
you out there talking to people

587
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,400
um but two important things here is one

588
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,760
keep an open mind

589
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,320
uh you know if you were in the stock 20

590
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,480
years ago 10 years ago

591
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,840
i guarantee you it's completely

592
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,799
different than it was back then so

593
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,400
even if you were in there six months ago

594
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,159
chances are technology's improved to the

595
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:29,840
point where most things are going to be

596
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,039
different already

597
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,520
so keeping an open mind

598
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,840
when you do these gimbal walks and then

599
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,840
ask questions like

600
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,880
you know you're not there to make

601
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,280
judgments you're not there to

602
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,120
make improvements on the spot you're

603
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,360
there to learn about what is the current

604
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,720
situation that i'm responsible for and

605
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,960
how can i like what can i find that

606
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,600
needs to be fixed a big piece of this is

607
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,200
the people doing the work

608
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,000
need to have input

609
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,520
hopefully executives aren't just walking

610
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,640
around

611
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,080
and say oh well it looks like their

612
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,080
problem is they only have four people on

613
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,000
staff so we need to just hire eight more

614
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,039
people

615
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,400
and that'll fix it

616
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,159
when in reality if you you know you just

617
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:11,440
kind of ask the question well why are we

618
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,280
behind well we're behind because we

619
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,880
actually have two servers that are down

620
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,799
and we can't do the work so hiring eight

621
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,720
people is just a complete waste that's

622
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,440
not going to actually

623
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,880
increase the ability of the team

624
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,799
the fish bone diagram

625
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,400
ishikawa diagram

626
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,320
this is a great way to

627
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,080
take a problem break it down into

628
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,320
categories and then start looking for

629
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,159
root causes here so um we'll i'll walk

630
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,919
through a cyber specific example here in

631
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,919
just a second but uh a

632
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,000
a well-developed problem statement is

633
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,919
once again critical to this uh if you

634
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,760
don't know what your what your actual

635
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,200
problem is what it is that you're

636
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,159
measuring what it is that needs to be

637
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,159
investigated and this is going to be a

638
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,880
really difficult exercise

639
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,280
um cultures want so we have people

640
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,799
processes equipment management

641
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,440
environment materials um this this is

642
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,960
just you know

643
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,640
adapt to fit your situation this isn't

644
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,400
anything

645
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,480
mandatory or required here but culture

646
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,480
is one that's commonly used but you have

647
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,320
to be careful with culture because it's

648
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,520
easy to blame an issue on culture

649
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,840
but it's not easy to change culture

650
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,840
right

651
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,080
so uh that's that's one thing that that

652
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,000
we definitely need to get um

653
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,600
be aware of

654
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,039
the other thing is let's indicate

655
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,200
actions right we can change actions but

656
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,280
we can't change people i mean we can

657
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,799
fire someone and bring in a new person

658
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,960
but um

659
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,159
at its core you can't change a person so

660
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,480
this should be focused on objective

661
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,799
things what are some actual

662
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,559
actions that we can observe and that we

663
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,918
can change from there

664
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,480
5y analysis i i hit on this one earlier

665
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,400
so i'm not going to go deep here again

666
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,280
but

667
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,640
our problem

668
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,840
start with the problem why is that a

669
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,600
problem well i ran through a red light

670
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,679
okay why why i was late for work why are

671
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,360
we late for work i woke up

672
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,880
you know just keep going down and

673
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,640
eventually get down to

674
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,559
well uh i didn't check my alarm clock

675
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,159
last night okay well that's something

676
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,840
that we can fix you know it's it's

677
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,240
broken uh with with this you'll also run

678
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,159
into instances where hey i have this

679
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,919
problem but there's actually like two or

680
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,960
three reasons why it's a problem

681
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,720
um

682
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,520
if that's the case okay cool work each

683
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,919
of those as their own sub and then ask

684
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,120
ask why

685
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,200
for each reason

686
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,559
you're also going to find hey this

687
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,559
problem is you know reason one two and

688
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,320
three i have another problem that's

689
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,039
actually also reasons one and three

690
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,039
and reason four

691
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,159
uh this this is just a way to map this

692
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,000
out this is great to do with sticky

693
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,840
notes on a wall uh getting your whole

694
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,159
team in there but you'll start being

695
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,640
able to see connections between problems

696
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,799
between causes

697
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,279
and then that also you know helps kind

698
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,200
of bring out solutions too when you get

699
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,360
there

700
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,240
so a specific

701
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,440
example for cyber here

702
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,000
uh so my company's hit by ransomware

703
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,279
okay crap

704
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,720
ransomware is obviously no good

705
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,400
ransomware is all over the news right

706
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,960
now uh i know there's there's several

707
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,360
other consulting firms that have you

708
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,760
know been approached on this or um by

709
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,080
the news by magazines articles whatever

710
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,760
it is

711
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,279
it's out there it's becoming more and

712
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,640
more

713
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,600
publicly aware it's been out there for

714
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,520
a long time

715
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,200
let's just say that our companies hit by

716
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,000
ransomware and we're gonna take a minute

717
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,159
we're going to look at well

718
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,080
how did we even get here because that's

719
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,279
that's really the big question that we

720
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,799
need to start with

721
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,279
so if we just focus on people equipment

722
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,200
process and materials

723
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,440
keep it simple these are the four things

724
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,679
okay so

725
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,679
with regards to equipment

726
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,120
what what

727
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,400
could be a reason why we're hit with

728
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,760
ransomware

729
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,640
uh

730
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,640
sir you know we have we didn't patch our

731
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,039
systems okay well unpatched systems is a

732
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,679
easy way to let attackers in

733
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:20,640
um

734
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,640
ransomware hey this hit us so hard

735
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,240
because we don't have backups if we had

736
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,880
backups and someone wiped our data you

737
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,960
know i mean it sucks but

738
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,880
we can recover from that a lot easier

739
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,279
than we can recover from having nothing

740
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,039
left

741
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,760
uh process well we don't actually have a

742
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,039
vulnerability management program so like

743
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,000
uh i mean we knew we had vulnerabilities

744
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,240
but there's no set schedule there's no

745
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,679
set process for

746
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:48,720
putting those out there and getting

747
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,159
those fixed

748
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:51,760
another process here hey we don't have

749
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,919
awareness training why is awareness

750
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,960
training important if we go up to people

751
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,880
people are caught by phishing

752
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,480
people click phishing emails all the

753
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,360
time

754
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,440
and

755
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,520
cyber security awareness training is is

756
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,200
another thing that's huge

757
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,640
especially right now i know that's

758
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,720
something that we do a lot of companies

759
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,320
are out there doing it but there's also

760
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,919
a lot of companies that

761
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,679
brush this off or just say hey well

762
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,200
microsoft outlook scans all of our

763
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,559
emails so you know we don't we don't

764
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:19,840
need to worry about phishing or anything

765
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,520
like that

766
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,279
but with that awareness training you can

767
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,880
actually

768
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,480
work on that to begin with and actually

769
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,760
get people trained and really

770
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,080
understanding the tool that's being used

771
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,919
instead of just throwing a tool at it

772
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,159
people insider threat this also you know

773
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:37,679
could have been initiated or completely

774
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,320
performed by a current employee a

775
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,960
recently dismissed employee

776
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,880
a contractor of the company something

777
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,120
like that

778
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,520
if we look at materials

779
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,039
materials is also another one that's

780
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,880
kind of hard because these things could

781
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,400
fall under another under like the

782
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,799
equipment category as well

783
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,279
let's just say that uh one particular

784
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,240
server was attacked and the one that was

785
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,000
attacked is actually

786
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,480
at somebody's house instead of uh like

787
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,640
at the at the office downtown

788
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,400
or

789
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,760
um the server room was unlocked and it

790
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,360
was easy to get to and breach

791
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,399
so

792
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,720
like with ransomware it it would be easy

793
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,919
to say

794
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,000
uh well if we had had

795
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,799
endpoint endpoint protection on here

796
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,000
um you know if we had an mdr or an xdr

797
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,159
or even a sim tool

798
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:33,440
law

799
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,440
checking logs and aggregating logs and

800
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,039
looking for patterns and things like

801
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,880
that this ransomware never would have

802
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,159
happened

803
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,159
okay but if you you know if you just put

804
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:43,200
mdr

805
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,200
on someone's device

806
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,279
like what is that actually fixing it if

807
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,600
if it's not put on properly they can

808
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,880
turn it off

809
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,520
um they also could have

810
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,679
you know have the mdr on their laptop

811
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:56,960
but they're using their phone on the

812
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,200
corporate network and the phone is what

813
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,120
actually got

814
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,360
attacked

815
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,520
or exploited and then they moved from

816
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,559
there

817
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,440
so mdr you know isn't necessarily going

818
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,760
to fix that it should but there are

819
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,279
there are definitely ways that people

820
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,200
could get around that

821
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,360
um

822
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,440
well let's see no awareness training

823
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,840
okay well if our people had been trained

824
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,120
um

825
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,640
you know if we had a formal cyber

826
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,399
program and we sent out test phishing

827
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,720
emails and

828
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,640
we made them do these trainings once a

829
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,360
month or they sit through uh you know a

830
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,720
two-hour

831
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,960
awareness session once a year

832
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,039
if we had that training session in place

833
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,080
um

834
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,240
then none of this would have happened

835
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,399
okay well people are trained but you

836
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,559
know your systems are still not patched

837
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,840
that training doesn't fix anything

838
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,559
so

839
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,480
the point that i want to get across here

840
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,080
is

841
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,720
cyber i.t in general you know

842
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,320
there's so many tools there's a tool for

843
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,840
everything there's literally an app for

844
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,840
everything right i know we've joked

845
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,039
about it for

846
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,919
for years but it's it's true

847
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:07,600
there's a tool there's an app for

848
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,960
anything

849
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,120
but a tool is only as good as its

850
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,480
implementation and as its maintenance so

851
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,840
anybody anybody can throw an mdr and pay

852
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,679
another company to manage it form

853
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,600
anybody can

854
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,360
say hey you know we don't have the

855
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,279
resources necessary

856
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,080
to properly

857
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,480
do proper risk assessments on our

858
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,720
vendors our partners our

859
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,240
whatever it may be

860
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,600
i'm just going to hire somebody else to

861
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,039
do that

862
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,559
but if you don't know what the actual

863
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,039
problem is you could just be throwing

864
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,360
solutions out there and not actually

865
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,799
fixing anything

866
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:47,440
um and then the whole treat the pro stop

867
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,200
treating the symptom and treat the real

868
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,240
problem

869
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,559
um

870
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,880
one of the i mean awareness is another

871
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,240
one of those like yeah you're training

872
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,320
people because people are are exploited

873
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,880
okay but the asset the actual device

874
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,600
itself is not hardened so even though

875
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,360
you're training people they still have

876
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,600
weak devices you still have a very broad

877
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,399
attack surface

878
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,880
and that training the people is great

879
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,640
but it's not going to stop anything on

880
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,760
the back end

881
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,440
so

882
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,399
process improvement is really important

883
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:25,039
a lot of times i kind of compare it to

884
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,760
agile in my mind

885
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,159
businesses pure business

886
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,600
can business teams can

887
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,159
they can benefit greatly from an agile

888
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:38,559
mindset you know the agile is a software

889
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,159
development process

890
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,480
but it's it's a mindset it's like it's a

891
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,679
culture

892
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,279
and business teams

893
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,120
can benefit from that and i've done

894
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,440
executive coaching

895
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,919
in agile for it but then also for

896
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,159
business teams and for

897
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:55,760
executives and business executives

898
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,279
specifically

899
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:00,320
and teaching the mindset is what is most

900
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,519
important

901
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,039
process improvement

902
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:05,279
typically i think it's more talked about

903
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:08,320
within the realm of lean and six sigma

904
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,519
and kaizen and continuous improvement

905
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,679
agile hits on it by breaking it into

906
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,000
those smaller sections but i think it's

907
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,799
more

908
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,360
talked about mainly as a business tool

909
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,320
and like well that's something the

910
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,080
business does and when they fix their

911
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,120
process

912
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,799
then the it will actually be able to

913
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,640
work with it

914
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,360
but i mean that's most certainly not not

915
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,480
the case process improvement is just any

916
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,600
process

917
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,559
it can be improved i just need some

918
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,880
some love and attention

919
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,760
um

920
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,519
you know getting the whole team in

921
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:45,279
getting brainstorming sessions going on

922
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,480
and every process can be can be

923
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,480
or can benefit from that

924
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,799
and i i think that that's something that

925
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,120
technology in general is kind of lacking

926
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,279
technology teams don't don't have the

927
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:58,960
same intentional

928
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,360
aspect of improving processes that a lot

929
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,640
of business

930
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,440
departments or business teams do

931
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,919
and it drives me absolutely crazy when

932
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,039
you go in somewhere and they're like

933
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,559
well that's an i.t process so i don't

934
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,000
need a word well that's a business

935
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,159
process i don't need to worry about it i

936
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,080
don't know we've always done it this way

937
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,080
or i've been here 30 years and i've

938
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,679
never had any issues

939
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,399
well those are all

940
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,159
those are all problems

941
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,240
that need to be addressed

942
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,919
and those are normally red flags for

943
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:31,600
like deeper problems that exist so

944
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,600
just to kind of wrap this up you know

945
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,679
what what should this mean

946
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,840
what should this mean for the industry

947
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,399
don't just throw tools at a problem

948
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:44,080
um antivirus is it's a tool

949
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,000
but it's just a tool it's not going to

950
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,039
stop phishing it's not going to stop

951
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:52,960
someone hacking into an unpatched system

952
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,360
think long-term solutions this goes

953
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,600
right back to let's actually figure out

954
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,760
what is the problem and not just address

955
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,960
those

956
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,200
those little fires that pop up

957
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,799
every hour

958
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,559
think long term

959
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:09,039
and yes we need to address those short

960
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,480
problems and those little fires that

961
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,440
come up

962
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,360
but that should we shouldn't just be

963
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,360
putting duct tape on everything you got

964
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,960
to put duct tape on it

965
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,080
do it if you have to quarantine a device

966
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,840
do it but don't leave it that way

967
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,399
um

968
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,000
do it for the need get everything back

969
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,480
up running basic instant response and

970
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,360
then

971
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,279
switch focus and look at what is the

972
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:33,039
real problem

973
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:34,960
how can we fix it

974
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,720
and go from there

975
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,120
again the people doing the work need to

976
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,880
be involved in these discussions if

977
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,039
there's just a team of executives that

978
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:46,000
are brainstorming on how to fix why

979
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,159
um the sim tool isn't feeding the ticket

980
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,360
system

981
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,039
chances are

982
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,360
if they do ever get to a solution it's

983
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,279
either not going to be the most

984
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,039
effective or it's going to take way

985
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,200
longer to get to it than if we just had

986
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,120
analysts in that says well these two

987
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,200
products actually aren't compatible like

988
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,840
that's why

989
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,279
um which is also why going to the game

990
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,560
was important

991
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,879
be curious be intentional always ask

992
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:14,239
questions keep an open mind um

993
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,320
by being intentional not just like oh i

994
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,918
have five minutes let me go talk to the

995
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:19,359
team and see what's up

996
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,599
make make time set a team meeting once a

997
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,918
week have a 15 minute check in every day

998
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:26,560
if you're in those high traffic areas

999
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,639
like a help desk like a sock doing

1000
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,199
threat analysts threat analysis things

1001
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,280
like that set intentional time if it's

1002
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,399
on your calendar

1003
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,320
you're more likely to do it

1004
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,320
that sticky note on your monitor isn't

1005
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,480
always going to catch your attention

1006
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,918
and if it does you know it may be too

1007
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:43,599
late

1008
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:45,359
think long-term solutions think

1009
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,359
long-term impact if i'm if i just put

1010
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:49,040
duct tape on this now what is that going

1011
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,239
to mean what does that mean to other

1012
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,280
systems

1013
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,480
was that going to mean to our bottom

1014
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,480
line was that going to mean to our

1015
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,879
partner companies

1016
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,480
things like that

1017
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,839
and then

1018
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:01,440
everyone should know that there is no

1019
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,800
perfect tool

1020
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,880
i don't care if someone sells you mdr

1021
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,200
xdr

1022
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,640
bz3dr whatever you know whatever it may

1023
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,760
be think something ridiculous here um

1024
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,280
there's no perfect tool there's no

1025
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,320
perfect team there's no perfect software

1026
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,640
everything is as good as it's

1027
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,480
one how it's built but to how it's

1028
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,800
utilized and implemented

1029
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,400
so

1030
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,839
hopefully um you know we can kind of

1031
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,320
spread the word here on process

1032
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,839
improvement is

1033
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:34,800
it's a concept it's a mindset it's it's

1034
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,839
a cultural aspect

1035
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,440
it starts from the top down but it needs

1036
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,839
to be maintained from the bottom up so

1037
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,440
hey everybody this is process

1038
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,280
improvement this is what we need to do i

1039
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,960
want you to go do it

1040
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,880
and then from the bottom up there like

1041
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,760
uh

1042
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,079
hey you know my desk is out of order i

1043
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:53,440
can't ever find anything well how could

1044
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,960
i improve that okay oh i could get a

1045
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,520
file folder i could get a paper stacker

1046
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,599
i could get cabinets

1047
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:01,680
as a simple process

1048
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,599
you can improve every every process that

1049
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,960
there is whether it's it or business so

1050
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,000
that's everything that i have um

1051
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,720
i guess if there are

1052
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,400
any questions i will open up for

1053
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,920
questions or just you know general

1054
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,240
discussions and comments here

1055
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,200
hey it's been great actually um

1056
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,760
so basically uh we had a great question

1057
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,400
that just popped right into the uh onto

1058
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,680
the chat i just want to go ahead and

1059
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,520
read it out it says what is a strategy

1060
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,920
to convince stakeholders that investing

1061
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,000
in cyber security is more than a cost

1062
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,520
center on the balance sheet

1063
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,520
oh man

1064
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,680
one of those how do we justify spending

1065
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,520
money

1066
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,359
right it's kind of what it comes down to

1067
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,119
for a lot of stakeholders isn't it it's

1068
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:49,359
like okay how much is this going to cost

1069
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:50,480
us

1070
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,119
yeah and and i know um so i'm actually

1071
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,400
i've been dealing with a client right

1072
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,160
now over the last several weeks and this

1073
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,640
is this is one of the problems um we

1074
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,240
went through the fish bone we went

1075
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,200
through the 5y and what we landed on is

1076
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,240
business really just views it as

1077
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,760
an inhibitor

1078
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,200
because

1079
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,440
there's been bad experiences before so

1080
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,839
it's not included up in the very first

1081
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:15,520
discussions

1082
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,880
so then they kind of get left behind so

1083
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,400
business is like hey i have this great

1084
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,280
plan

1085
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,960
go do it and then you're like well we

1086
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,640
need to patch these we need to get new

1087
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,320
servers for this we have to do all this

1088
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,480
and they're like all you do is throw out

1089
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,440
problems and like spend money like you

1090
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,839
add you add 50

1091
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:32,960
um

1092
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,640
to the schedule and

1093
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,400
50 60 to the budget

1094
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,560
and one of those is you know it's it's

1095
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,640
just getting up front so a good way that

1096
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,040
you can do that is one there should be a

1097
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,560
solid champion that's respected by

1098
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,960
business um if you don't have that

1099
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,720
you're never gonna be taken seriously

1100
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,280
two if all you're doing is legitimately

1101
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,480
bringing problems increasing the budget

1102
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,480
and the schedule

1103
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,920
then maybe you shouldn't be taken

1104
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,040
seriously

1105
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,119
i think following that fish tree diagram

1106
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:03,040
you were you were showing actually is a

1107
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,240
really great way to start doing

1108
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,520
quantified

1109
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,200
risk management from the perspective of

1110
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,119
every single one of those problem areas

1111
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,800
you were showing of process and

1112
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,200
equipment and people

1113
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,800
i think each one of those were very

1114
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,160
interesting because

1115
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,359
you obviously will have various

1116
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:19,839
solutions to those problems and what you

1117
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,040
could do is you can kind of say okay how

1118
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,800
much is that going to cost us for a year

1119
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,720
let's say and you can start going

1120
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,720
through and putting up all the costs but

1121
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,560
then you have the problem in the case of

1122
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,800
a ransomware attack and say here's what

1123
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,400
it actually cost us

1124
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,400
and then you maybe extend the problem

1125
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,079
statement to say and here's how much

1126
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,280
revenue

1127
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,760
stands to be lost over a particular

1128
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,760
period of time like what business

1129
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,359
process did that affect what's the

1130
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:45,920
revenue impact that could have happened

1131
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,680
and so now you kind of work that then

1132
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,000
back to start saying uh here's all the

1133
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,079
different solutions we have and you

1134
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,680
start seeing where things might be more

1135
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,760
effective or not but they may carry

1136
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,280
disproportionate dollar amounts

1137
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,640
something that costs very little may

1138
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,280
have a huge impact something that's huge

1139
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,920
and cumbersome uh may end up

1140
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,839
may end up actually costing very little

1141
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:07,839
or something right so there's

1142
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:09,599
there's a lot of uh there's a lot of

1143
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,040
things out there that are like that and

1144
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,960
you can kind of figure out okay we maybe

1145
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,960
can't get all of this but what are you

1146
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,480
know out of the five what are the two

1147
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,560
things we can start today and then how

1148
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,320
how are we doing that to kind of reduce

1149
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,920
and solve this problem i think that's a

1150
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,960
great way to do it and i'm just

1151
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,960
piggybacking off that fish because i've

1152
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,720
never seen that fish tree diagram like

1153
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,960
that or a fish bone diagram but i

1154
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,560
thought that was really cool for gap

1155
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,480
finding and then uh kind of going into

1156
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,440
the uh

1157
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,680
to the risk management part

1158
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,240
yeah and and one of the big things um so

1159
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,760
you know fish bone is normally one of

1160
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,680
those early things that you do it kind

1161
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,000
of gets you okay let's let's try to just

1162
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,400
put things into categories and and go

1163
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,079
from there um

1164
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:50,720
the one i had 246 i mean i had seven

1165
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,560
seven things on there let's say we only

1166
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,720
have an hour to discuss right okay we

1167
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,640
have seven things we have seven people

1168
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,480
everybody you get one vote pick what you

1169
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,240
want to talk about the top one that's

1170
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,599
what we're going to focus on let's do

1171
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,839
five y's on that and go from there

1172
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,839
um but the you know the other thing that

1173
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:07,920
you hit on is like hey what's what's the

1174
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,720
revenue that that could be lost

1175
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,480
that's something that healthcare and

1176
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,480
insurance companies right now are really

1177
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,480
struggling with because

1178
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,000
say they get hit with ransomware and

1179
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,640
their bounty is 50 55 000

1180
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,359
hey pay us 55 grand and you can have

1181
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,119
your data back

1182
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:28,319
okay well um

1183
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:30,079
i mean we should do that that's 50k

1184
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:32,319
right or it's a large company 50 grand

1185
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:33,839
whatever we'll just like it's fine we'll

1186
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,839
just start over right okay well you just

1187
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:38,720
lost 24 hours of data um if your health

1188
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,079
care

1189
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,720
i mean that's now you have lawsuits and

1190
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,319
you know you have confidentiality

1191
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,800
breaches and all that stuff and yeah

1192
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,000
like

1193
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,240
if it is the one saying hey this is what

1194
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,440
we're looking at this is our problem

1195
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,880
here's what we lost

1196
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,079
you have to have business come in and

1197
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:55,839
say yeah but

1198
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:57,599
over the next six months we're still

1199
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,839
going to be paying for this so that 50k

1200
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:03,200
just went to two million dollars exactly

1201
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,800
and that's why business and i.t have got

1202
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,359
to work together um

1203
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:09,280
and then yeah go ahead oh i was gonna

1204
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,280
say another piece that i really loved uh

1205
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,720
i'd never heard of go to the was it

1206

never never had heard of that but one

1208
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:20,560
thing that i've really liked uh and and

1209
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,079
the pandemic has actually really

1210
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,640
impacted the ability to like go to uh

1211
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,079
you know the hospital floor if you're in

1212
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:27,920
medical if you're in manufacturing go to

1213
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,480
the manufacturing floor even uh or even

1214
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,640
a simple thing as you wanna know why

1215
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,640
accounting keeps on clicking those

1216
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,760
phishing

1217
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,520
or those attachments

1218
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,640
go see what legit business looks like go

1219
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,280
go sit down with them and have them show

1220
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,440
you what invoices actually look like and

1221
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,560
say

1222
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,800
yeah those those hackers are doing those

1223
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,240
or criminals rather because we're all

1224
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,040
hackers here but uh those criminals man

1225
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,880
they're really good at making it look

1226
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,319
like the work that they're supposed to

1227
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:57,839
do and of course they're gonna click it

1228
00:41:57,839 --> 00:41:59,760
because that's their business

1229
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,160
process yeah right and so you know

1230
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,480
getting down to that to that line level

1231
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,480
of how do you it's almost it's really

1232
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,440
comes down to taking taking uh arrows

1233
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,520
from the quivers of uh

1234
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,480
user experience yeah engineers and kind

1235
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,720
of figure out um you know hey what does

1236
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,480
this process look like to the person who

1237
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,880
uses this every day mfa is another thing

1238
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,040
that comes to mind how is that process

1239
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,800
affecting

1240
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,720
your people and how do you make it

1241
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,720
better because you need to do mfa you

1242
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,640
really do but there's a lot of ways you

1243
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,920
could do it

1244
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:32,960
yeah

1245
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,240

downloaded it now you know now i scan

1255
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,240
the code

1256
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,160
okay well now it kicks me back out and i

1257
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,000
have to sign in again and then use the

1258
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,760
code again like it just took me eight

1259
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,440
minutes to log in

1260
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,800
to an app for a 30-second discussion yes

1261
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,119
those are things that uh yeah management

1262
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:09,760
doesn't see it sees but doesn't care and

1263
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,400
the user's like screw it

1264
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,640
i'm just going to do this get you your

1265
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,880
thing get get what you need and i'll do

1266
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,720
the rest later and then at some point

1267
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,960
the board is asking you the cso or

1268
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,880
security director yeah so we need to get

1269
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,960
rid of mfa because all our people hate

1270
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,720
it and is you know and and you're not at

1271
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,000
the point where you can go oh well we

1272
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,599
can make this better they're like no

1273
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,520
we've been to this room we're paying for

1274
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,680
it and no one's using it yeah another

1275
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,680
thing for it and people aren't using it

1276
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,319
or you know it's actually costing us

1277
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:39,599
longer like you said it took me eight

1278
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,920
minutes to get into a 30-second thing

1279
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,319
it's causing process issues and it's

1280
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:46,319
causing more expense

1281
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:48,400
so um no i really like that another

1282
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,240
question is um

1283
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,400
what tools so we we talk about tools and

1284
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,960
this is about process but so keeping

1285
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,560
track of all these process discussions

1286
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,480
what tools exist out there what what are

1287
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,800
tools that are helpful in kind of

1288
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,640
bringing all these process uh

1289
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,640
discussions together so an almost like

1290
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,160
project management in a way you can kind

1291
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,560
of work in and have conversations with

1292
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,400
people on on these processes what are

1293
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,079
tools that exist to kind of bring those

1294
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:13,839
process discussions together and kind of

1295
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:17,040
track your progress to solving or

1296
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,920
mitigating uh process issues

1297
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,800
yeah so um i mean

1298
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,000
this is definitely not a uh a sponsor or

1299
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,920
a pitch or anything like that but one

1300
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,520
tool that i do like um it's called miro

1301
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,440
it started out as

1302
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,480
i think it used to be called like

1303
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,920
real-time whiteboard or something like

1304
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,400
that but it's an online whiteboard that

1305
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,000
started out hey you can put sticky notes

1306
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,200
on here

1307
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,280
okay well now you know they've they've

1308
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,960
expanded they've grown

1309
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,880
um they have all sorts of templates so

1310
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,640
they have a fishbone diagram template

1311
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,400
they have a 5y template

1312
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,800
they have a roadmap template a racy

1313
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,240
chart they have

1314
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,760
all these different matrices and

1315
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,359
templates that you can do

1316
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:59,520
that is everything i talked about

1317
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:03,200
regardless of lean six sigma pdca kaizen

1318
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,040
agile whatever like

1319
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,359
it is literally just a universal tool

1320
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:09,280
that brings all these tools together and

1321
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,960
you can literally do it all on one board

1322
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,280
and you can zoom all the way out

1323
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,119
so that you can have every tool in here

1324
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:16,960
and just zoom in as you need

1325
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:17,760
um

1326
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,640
so

1327
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,800
that's huge but then also it you know if

1328
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,319
you can have a tool that other people

1329
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,480
can sign in and you can interact with

1330
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,760
together

1331
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,839
miro if you have 50 people in there all

1332
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:30,400
50 people can on their own device real

1333
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,359
time

1334
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:33,920
be adding stickies and things like that

1335
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,920
how do you spell mirror by the way yeah

1336
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,200
it's right there in the chat oh there

1337
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,760
you go yeah you saw it

1338
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,359
i finally figured out which chat it was

1339
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:44,079
yeah yeah sorry about that um but no

1340
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,240
this uh this has been great i saw that

1341
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,240
uh a person by the that was a person by

1342
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,720
the name of chunkymonkey313

1343
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,960
uh love those y's what were those y's

1344
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,400
again what were some of those y's again

1345
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,839
that you were talking about i think it

1346
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:58,000
was clear at the beginning of your uh

1347
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,280
your your program talking about the

1348
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,040
different why's of a process like why

1349
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,200
this or why that

1350
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,760
um oh man

1351
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,160
so like the the five wise

1352
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,880
yeah the five wise yes so the the five

1353
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,200
wise that's just uh you know another yet

1354
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,040
simple uh but

1355
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,520
really useful technique of

1356
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,200
typically when when we say hey i have a

1357
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,200
problem that's not our actual problem

1358
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,440
right so that's why you get down to a

1359
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,200
solid problem statement

1360
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,240
but then

1361
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,880
you know oh i'm hot all the sun's out

1362
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,480
okay well that's not why you're hot

1363
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,760
right the sun's out in the winter and

1364
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,599
it's freezing so

1365
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:35,440
why why are you actually hot well i'm

1366
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,720
wearing a jacket well why are you

1367
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,800
wearing a jacket well i was cold inside

1368
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,560
but you know like

1369
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,960
it's it's kind of just

1370
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,400
just keep asking yourself why and

1371
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,800
eventually everyone gets annoyed

1372
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,800
and you get to the point where i don't

1373
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,079
know that's just that's just what the

1374
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:51,760
ceo said

1375
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,839
sounds like a socratic method of uh kind

1376
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:55,599
of approaching problem statements of

1377
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:57,920
just kind of getting to the cause of it

1378
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,560
of well well why this uh dependency

1379
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,920
tracking there

1380
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,440
really yeah yeah

1381
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,200
yeah i mean not yet not to get super

1382
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,800
philosophical but i mean that's that's

1383
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,480
really what it is if you want to get to

1384
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,920
the root of the problem and you you want

1385
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,359
to figure out hey what's the biggest

1386
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,800
bang for my buck

1387
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,560
you have to ask questions you have to be

1388
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,880
curious you have to see it firsthand you

1389
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,560
have to get the right people

1390
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:22,160
um i'm a psych major and

1391
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,400
uh you know grew up in cyber did

1392
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,880
psychology did intelligence back in

1393
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,680
cyber now um psychologies and everything

1394
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,200
and i focused on behavioral and

1395
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,720
organizational psych

1396
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,680
and i can tell you getting philosophical

1397
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,839
asking questions and thinking about how

1398
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:40,319
people are going to react to things

1399
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:43,520
those cross all industries um so yeah

1400
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,359
that i mean socratic method asking

1401
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:47,200
questions that that stuff is normally

1402
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,040
the simple solutions to our super hard

1403
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,800
technical problems

1404
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,400
so uh tell me about we're gonna reveal

1405
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,000
risk what's your favorite thing about

1406
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,079
working at reveal risk

1407
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:58,319
uh yeah so the actually the last place i

1408
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:00,480
came from i had a team of seven our team

1409
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,640
was killer but it was way different

1410
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,880
atmosphere than um the company as a

1411
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,280
whole so when i came to reveal risk our

1412
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,839
company is exactly what my whole team

1413
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:13,280
was at my previous place so i got to

1414
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,040
kind of keep the atmosphere in the team

1415
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,119
environment that i had

1416
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:18,800
it's cross-functional we all get our

1417
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,119
hands dirty and everything um

1418
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:22,880
i mean we're all sitting and working you

1419
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,599
know with our co-founders super friendly

1420
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,319
engaging collaborative place um

1421
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:31,040
but also like this is my first time in a

1422
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,480
consulting role

1423
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,200
but being able to get hands-on and i was

1424
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,880
i was brought on to increase our

1425
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,839
services you know so different uh like

1426

service catalog items

1427
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,559
but

1428
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:44,480
at the same time you know i'm doing

1429
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,160
third-party risk assessments i'm doing

1432
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,119
i get to use all my cyber experience all

1433

1436
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,440
giant box of cyber security

1437
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,240

1438
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,079

and a lot of them are also like hey

1441
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:13,040
here's our problem

1442
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,720
how do we fix it but more importantly

1443
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,200
like let's get creative how how can we

1444
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,559
really

1445
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:20,000
what what can we do that's new to

1446
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,760

1447
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,400
with a lot of great people yeah and i

1448
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,319
