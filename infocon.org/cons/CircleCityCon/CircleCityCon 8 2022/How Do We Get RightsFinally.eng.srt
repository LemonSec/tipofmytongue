scared to disclose and for all you for

16
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,719
what you do and um also to any of the

17
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,480
hackers in the community that have been

18
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,879
prosecuted or threatened with a lawsuit

19
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,960
for trying to do something good or doing

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,160
their job

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,520
and to all the people who are in the

22
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,520
fight to bring rights for hackers behind

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,559
scenes

24
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,080

i'm happy to answer any questions that

42
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,040
anyone may have

43
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,960
all right now let's get into why you all

44
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,960
are here

45
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,520
first things first is that for those

46
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,360
that aren't aware what is hacking is not

47
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,680
a crime which is this organization that

48
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,759
i co-founded with brian

49
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,600
is that we're basically a grassroots

50
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,320
movement that is trying to change and

51
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,479
challenge the public perceptions of how

52
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,040
they view hackers in the community in

53
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,600
other words the reality is that we have

54
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,038
laws that have been around since the

55
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,560
1980s

56
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,080
and this is because there was no

57
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,319
representation at the time

58
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,680
of our voices at the table and so they

59
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,920
have lumped us in in one group that

60
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,560
attackers and hackers are the same thing

61
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,480
and so this public reception is the

62
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,280
reason why we're kind of

63
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,239
stuck

64
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,080
and while we haven't gotten rights or

65
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,720
protections so we have to change that

66
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,879
narrative and so that's what hack is not

67
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,959
a crime is all about it's this it's a

68
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,480
grassroots movement of the hacker

69
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,560
community coming together to try to

70
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,400
challenge public perception of what is a

71
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,879
hacker who is a hacker

72
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,959
but also to

73
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,200
want to push an advocacy

74
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,360
for rights because we need them at this

75
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,200
point it's been the longest time ever so

76
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,440
that's what we basically do

77
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,599
um but for those that aren't aware that

78
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,159
yes there's two parties that do exist in

79
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,400
our field i just want to talk about that

80
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,239
very quickly so we're all on the same

81
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,040
page so first things first what is the

82
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,040
hacker versus attacker and i always say

83
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,720
it's the intent

84
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,440
so basically a hacker also known as

85
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,599
security researcher

86
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,599
basically uses skills to keep things

87
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,159
secured they never extort

88
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,720
they stay within scope and exploit with

89
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,040
permission only

90
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,920
now

91
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,080
the overall intent for a hacker is to

92
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,080
protect and serve

93
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,680
is to do well

94
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,760
however an attacker uses the exact same

95
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,959
skill set

96
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,599
but to do something that could hurt

97
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,000
so in a sense this could um hurt and

98
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,480
extort this means exploiting without

99
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,840
permission this means going out of scope

100
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,799
often but it the intent is somehow

101
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,720
criminal

102
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,200
so an attacker may also go by criminal

103
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,439
cyber criminal malicious actor but the

104
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,120
thing as you are probably aware is that

105
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,360
in the press it's also reported that

106
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,159
attacker is the same as a hacker

107
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,920
and so this is a huge problem that we're

108
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,319
facing because a lot of the times public

109
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,480
doesn't know that these two parties

110
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,840
coexist

111
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,920
but the thing is is that they're very

112
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,640
different because they have what they do

113
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,159
is the intent of it all

114
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,238
so i want to talk about the current

115
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,160
landscape so everyone is on the same

116
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,360
page because i don't know what

117
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,680
everyone's backgrounds is but i want

118
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,800
everyone to have an idea of why we need

119
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,320
rights and

120
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,639
and why it's so important so we're going

121
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,240
to talk about that a little bit and then

122
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,680
i'm going to dive into the social

123
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,880
constructed

124
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,360
part of it all of why we are where we

125
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,440
are and how do we challenge these

126
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,080
socially constructed beliefs so then we

127
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,960
can have change because you have to get

128
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,000
the public on board to have rights or

129
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,479
for them to even listen

130
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,560
so let's dive into the current landscape

131
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,800
and one of my favorite stories that i

132
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,400
like to share

133
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,680
is the case study of uh kevin and what

134
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,600
he had to deal with dji

135
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,919
it was his case that i i remember

136
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,240
learning about from meet elizari's talk

137
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,160
that made me want to get into hacker

138
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,280
rights

139
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,560
because it just it fuminated me i was so

140
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,240
upset um

141
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,120
so

142
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,919
for those that do not know dji a major

143
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,320
drone manufacturer basically created a

144
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,360
bug body program now this bug benny

145
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,759
platform program itself that you should

146
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,240
note is that they ran it themselves they

147
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,400
didn't go through hacker one bug crowd

148
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,360
or cynic they went for it themselves so

149
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,360
this is already letting you know ahead

150
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,960
of the time

151
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,960
that this might be a problem and if

152
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,479
you're wondering why would this be a

153
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,320
problem is because

154
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,560
having vulnerability disclosure programs

155
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,800
and bug bounty programs that are run

156
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,039
in-house you need to have the staff to

157
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,360
do that and a lot of times

158
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,360
they just um

159
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,840
when they release a bug battery program

160
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,600
within their own house

161
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,360
they go full on run

162
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,120
the thing is that you want to do kind of

163
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,319
like this crawl walk run approach

164
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,160
because when you're you want to make

165
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,000
sure you have all the foundations and

166
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,600
structures in place

167
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,960
and with dji this was their situation

168
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,639
was that they just created a bug bounty

169
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:17,840
program because they thought this might

170
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,919
be a good thing to do but in reality

171
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,319
they didn't have the infrastructure set

172
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,759
and in place

173
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,680
so when um

174
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,840
hackers participated

175
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,000
they were facing some issues kevin

176
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,880
unfortunately was one of those cases so

177
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,720
kevin basically came across their bug

178
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,160
bounty program

179
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,880
and he wanted to make sure everything

180
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,440
that was stated you know on their site

181
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,680
what was in scope that he wanted to

182
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,160
reconfirm it just for his own safety and

183
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,360
protection

184
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,599
so he sent them an email basically

185
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,199
asking if all these things are within

186
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,039
scope just to double confirm before

187
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,800
participating in their vulnerability

188
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,440
disclosure program or their bug money

189
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,280
program

190
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,520
and what happened was that it took two

191
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,080
weeks for them to respond so once again

192
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,160
remember i was saying like when you're

193
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,400
when you're doing it in your own house

194
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,000
if you don't have an infrastructure in

195
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,319
place you're gonna have problems they

196
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,319
didn't have the infrastructure in place

197
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,080
clearly because it took two weeks for

198
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,240
them to respond on something that was

199
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,680
already posted elsewhere of what was in

200
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,039
scope

201
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,319
so

202
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,360
but besides that

203
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,479
kevin

204
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,120
did find a vulnerability and he reported

205
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,360
it they wanted to offer him thirty

206
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,199
thousand dollars so to be able to

207
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,720
receive this thirty thousand dollars he

208
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,720
had to sign an agreement

209
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,960
however this agreement offered no

210
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,199
legislative well not legislative but it

211
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,120
didn't offer any legal protections for

212
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,639
him

213
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,560
and he was like i'm not going to take

214
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,319
this risk 30 000 is not worth my life at

215
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,919
risk here so he walked away

216
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,479
but the thing was that dji

217
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:59,520
um

218
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,599
they were a little bit afraid their

219
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,560
marketing pr team and legal team were

220
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,039
all nervous that he may become one of

221
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,840
those people that outs them in public

222
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,000
and they have to face a pr situation

223
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,160
kevin wasn't planning on doing any of

224
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,120
that

225
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,919
he was already moving on to other things

226
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,120
but they were afraid that he would

227
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,280
so what ended up happening was that they

228
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,879
served him

229
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,680
with a letter which you see here

230
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,840
basically saying that he went out of

231
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,839
scope when in fact he stayed within

232
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:34,880
scope

233
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,159
and that he was breaking the cfaa which

234
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,599
is a

235
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:40,399
in

236
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,360
law that we'll get into in a bit

237
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,320
but basically saying that it was his

238
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,480
fault he stepped out of line

239
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,399
and that they're going to go after and

240
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,760
pursue him

241
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,839
in

242
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,120
court now the one thing you should note

243
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,839
though is that in their communications

244
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:58,880
with them

245
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,959
if he could scroll he scrolled down all

246
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,880
the way through the chain and there was

247
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,720
internal communication that was

248
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,720
happening that's how he found out that

249
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,839
they saw him as a threat a legal threat

250
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,200
a pr situation because it was stated

251
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,399
within the text of the email because the

252
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,880
person who sent him an email didn't

253
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,720
realize there was an internal chain

254
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,640
within this email

255
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,040
and so what he did was that he basically

256
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,120
published every single email

257
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,760
communication he's ever had with dji

258
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,279
publicly

259
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,920
to try to protect himself

260
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,120
dji then retracted it

261
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,560
because then the reality was that they

262
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,120
had no case he basically proved them but

263
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,120
the thing was that it put his life in

264
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,320
jeopardy

265
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,640
because he was just trying to protect

266
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,920
and serve

267
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,519
and he stayed within scope he did all

268
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,680
the right things but yet they still had

269
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,920
the ability to do this

270
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,839
and this is something that is common

271
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,240
this isn't like a one-off situation this

272
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,360
is fairly common

273
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,200
so this is the one of the things we have

274
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,680
to talk about is like how do we fix this

275
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,279
so we don't have any more cases like

276
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,120
kevin is dealing with or some of our

277
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,200
friends and family have dealt with

278
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,200
and this is why we have to influence the

279
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,480
public

280
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,720
perception of who we are

281
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,600
now

282
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,160
if you remember anything about political

283
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,160
science if you've taken any political

284
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,920
courses the thing that you always

285
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,920
remember is that if you're going to

286
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,320
influence the public opinion you have to

287
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,959
work with the media organizations and

288
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,640
legislation

289
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,800
that's how you change things they all

290
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,360
intersect with one another so it's so

291
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,079
important that we do this you can't just

292
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,160
focus on one thing you have to focus on

293
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,040
all three to be able to have change

294
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,360
so for example

295
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,720
for the organizations to learn how to do

296
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,480
better policies such as having

297
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,959
vulnerability disclosure policies

298
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,040
that they turn to the media they turn to

299
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,399
legislation

300
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,480
for legislation to actually have

301
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,360
anything being presented

302
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,480
of any change or amendments to any acts

303
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,240
out there

304
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,360
they need to have first media around it

305
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,640
otherwise they're not going to know that

306
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,320
this is an issue

307
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,560
so organizations and media can push

308
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,360
issues for legislators to look at and

309
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,640
look into to create new things

310
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,560
the media plays a huge role because the

311
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,360
media is what actually starts forming

312
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,200
and creating these socially constructed

313
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,040
beliefs a lot of times socially

314
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,320
constructive beliefs which we're going

315
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,519
to go into

316
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,839
are also stereotypes that aren't

317
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,440
actually true

318
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,680
so the thing is is that the public is

319
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,600
totally influenced by the media

320
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,680
organizations and legislation so that's

321
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,120
why you have to work with all three of

322
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,560
these groups and that's what we're going

323
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,240
to talk about today is how do we do this

324
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,440
because it's a lot of work

325
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,040
well the first step is you got to know

326
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,440
how human behavior works

327
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,440
so for all your social engineers out

328
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,120
there or people that are trying to

329
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,120
become a social engineer

330
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,959
i'm going to teach you something here

331
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,200
about the fear response

332
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,200
but before we do that you first need to

333
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,040
always be aware what is a socially

334
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,639
constructive belief

335
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,920
so social construction theory says that

336
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,680
humans create constructs in order to

337
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,320
make sense of the objective world that

338
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,600
we live in

339
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,079
and the one way humans create social

340
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,399
constructs is by structuring what they

341
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,959
see and experiences into categories i

342
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,800
know it seems really

343
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,279
simple it's simplified

344
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,320
it is it's completely you simplifying

345
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,959
people things around you to make sense

346
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,560
of things to make it easier to

347
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,760
understand

348
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,200
but the thing you need to understand is

349
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,360
that things are not black and white if

350
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,000
anything they're multiple shades of gray

351
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,760
and the thing we need to understand here

352
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,519
is that socially constructive beliefs

353
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,000
are stereotypes it's stereotypes of how

354
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,399
the world works and how people that live

355
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,240
in this world work and who they are

356
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,560
so socially constructed beliefs of the

357
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,360
hacker community has been as you know in

358
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,800
movies from books from tv shows hackers

359
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,440
are bad people in other words they are

360
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,240
attackers it's very rare to have a

361
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,519
quote-unquote ethical hacker in a movie

362
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,160
or a tv show but the thing to understand

363
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,680
is that

364
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,440
it's really hard to challenge that

365
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,800
perception

366
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,320
so socially constructive beliefs are

367
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,760
really important for us to understand

368
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,240
because that is how we function and

369
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,079
understand the world but socially

370
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,240
constructive beliefs themselves can also

371
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,839
cause us to have a fear response

372
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,680
so i'm going to use an example with you

373
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,519
so then you have a better understanding

374
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,800
with an example how we process threats

375
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,160
because it's important for you to

376
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,560
understand through an example to be able

377
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,440
to understand how we all function and

378
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,839
how we can actually challenge these

379
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,959
these these beliefs

380
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,480
so i want you to

381
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,480
we're just going to pretend okay pretend

382
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,320
that there's no

383
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,000
hair coloring kits out there in the

384
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,160
world you're either born with your hair

385
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,320
that way and there's no way you can fix

386
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,920
it

387
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,519
but there are certain people that are

388
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,360
born with pink hair

389
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,760
now the thing to note is that a person

390
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,839
with pink hair just has pink hair

391
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,000
there's no difference other than they

392
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,320
just have pink hair

393
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,040
and

394
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,480
it's genetic so any you know it's passed

395
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,279
on

396
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,120
so the thing to understand is that pink

397
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,480
hair people

398
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,440
are

399
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,120
are out there and they live there and

400
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,120
there's no way you can challenge that or

401
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,760
change a hair color

402
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,120
and you're probably like where are you

403
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,279
going with this so

404
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,639
imagine that

405
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,240
when growing up

406
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,120
that

407
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,079
on the tv whenever you turn on the news

408
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,399
the person who's always the dangerous

409
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,120
character is the person with pink hair

410
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,120
so every time you turn on the news it's

411
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,959
someone with pink hair

412
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,000
any time that you listen to the radio it

413
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,639
always says another

414
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,480
person with pink hair

415
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,320
robbed this person

416
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,880
or whenever you read a book it's always

417
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,800
the person with pink hair that you know

418
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,199
is going to be the bad guy

419
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,440
so the thing is is that

420
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,760
people with pink hair are somehow we've

421
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,079
been ingrained to believe are dangerous

422
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:28,160
people criminals if you could say

423
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,240
now the thing to note is that because

424
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,639
you have been taught and believed you

425
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,160
know directly

426
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,800
um and indirectly that pink hair people

427
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,360
are dangerous you have created this

428
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,040
memory um this storage of survival

429
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,959
so the thing you need to know about your

430
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,800
brain

431
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,120
is that there's this part of your brain

432
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,040
called the amygdala it's an almond

433
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,320
shaped tissue that's within your

434
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,959
temporal lobe your temporal lobe is

435
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,800
basically the part of your brain that

436
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,240
puts

437
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,639
your memories and your sensations and

438
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,600
your feelings in one place

439
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,079
and the thing is that it also provides a

440
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,320
guideline or a structure or a mapping

441
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,600
system as well like a gps

442
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,360
now the amygdala is something important

443
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,600
to acknowledge because the amygdala you

444
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,199
may have heard of it it's a fight versus

445
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,759
flight mechanism but it's also

446
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,880
a fight versus flight and standing

447
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,240
completely still shocked and terrified

448
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,839
so there's actually three things with

449
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,480
the amygdala it's not just you run away

450
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,560
or you fight something

451
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,320
you also can be

452
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,079
scared out of your mind and just staying

453
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,759
completely still

454
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,920
now the amygdala is completely

455
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,320
subconscious when it's working in your

456
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,160
brain but the thing is that it's taking

457
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,959
memories and social constructive beliefs

458
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,440
and put it into use so say for example

459
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,720
you're walking down the street and

460
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,000
there's someone with the pink hair

461
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,519
behind you

462
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,360
now the person with pink hair behind you

463
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,120
once again it's just a person with pink

464
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,639
hair but the thing is that you have

465
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,639
these socially constructed beliefs in

466
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,399
society that people can care are

467
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,760
dangerous individuals so for you

468
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,520
you're going to walk down the street and

469
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,119
that person will pick hairs behind you

470
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,679
and then your amygdala flips in a sense

471
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,480
that it's saying worrying warning

472
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,240
danger alert someone pink hair is behind

473
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,079
you

474
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,240
this warning is then from the amygdala

475
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,199
sent to the prefrontal cortex

476
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,520
now the prefrontal cortex acts like the

477
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,440
ceo of your brain

478
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,080
and while it's processing information

479
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,559
it's completely conscious now so

480
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,480
everything that you're doing is now a

481
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,120
conscious decision or a conscious thing

482
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,760
that you are doing at that moment versus

483
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,360
the migla was completely subconscious

484
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,440
you have no idea that's going on

485
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,440
but the amygdala alerts the prefrontal

486
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,760
cortex to let it know that there is a

487
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,240
perceived threat so then the prefrontal

488
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,480
cortex has to use logic and reasoning to

489
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,799
break it down to be like okay

490
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,640
how do i understand

491
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,480
if this is an actual threat what are the

492
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,440
actions that i can take

493
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,440
so this is the thing i want you to

494
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,160
remember is that this is a conscious

495
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,720
decision and process now

496
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,640
so the amygdala sent a warning of the

497
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,799
person with pink hair to the prefrontal

498
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,480
cortex of your brain

499
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,919
now your brain is coming up with

500
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,400
suggestions of what to do because this

501
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,880
is a perceived threat

502
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,400
first option

503
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,720
is you can cross the street second

504
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,520
option you can go into a local store

505
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,679
third option you can clutch your bag a

506
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,440
little bit tighter

507
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,840
and these three are the main ones that

508
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,760
come through your mind however there's

509
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,480
always a approach that we always forget

510
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,640
which is ignore

511
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,320
so you can ignore the threat in other

512
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,080
words you can be like you know what i'm

513
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,440
going to use my logic and reasoning and

514
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,720
be like no i don't need to do these

515
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,600
things

516
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,520
but during this time you have those

517
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,200
actions in your mind and then you start

518
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,559
breaking them down

519
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,160
okay if i cross the street there's a

520
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,520
chance that this person with pink hair

521
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,760
will follow me

522
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,919
does that help this is save me this is

523
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,240
rescuing me or not well it will then

524
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,160
provide me an idea to note that this

525
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,880
person is following me actually and that

526
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,840
maybe

527
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,679
maybe this is going to be one of those

528
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:14,799
moments that they're going to commit

529
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,520
some sort of crime against me

530
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,120
now the second solution you're thinking

531
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,200
okay i could go in a store chances are

532
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,960
that person might follow me if so i can

533
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,960
go and tell someone that this person's

534
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,440
following me so i'll be safer going in a

535
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,320
store

536
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,679
or third

537
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,919
i could just clutch my bag a little bit

538
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,679
tighter so in case this person is trying

539
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,720
to rob me i will be okay my bag will be

540
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,880
okay because i'm holding on to it tight

541
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,679
and i'll just walk a little bit faster

542
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,080
and the fourth one is

543
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,080
not taking any action

544
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,799
maybe it's all in my head maybe i'm

545
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,240
wrong maybe

546
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,000
maybe this person is just one of those

547
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
very rare individuals with pink hair

548
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,640
that isn't going to harm me

549
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,640
so you kind of see a little bit of how

550
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,240
your brain is processing a threat here

551
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,159
but there's one thing you need to note

552
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,799
is that there is one way that you can

553
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,799
challenge socially constructive beliefs

554
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,760
and even stereotypes to this very day

555
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,840
and that's from having a face-to-face

556
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,919
conversation kind of like how i'm doing

557
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,400
right now with you is that i

558
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,400
i'm telling you about something

559
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,880
and you're seeing my face you're seeing

560
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,440
uh my emotions on my face you're reading

561
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,400
me at the same time you're hearing me

562
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,000
but the thing is that's really

563
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,520
interesting is that when people share

564
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,440
their personal stories

565
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,960
to the to your face or on a camera like

566
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,559
face timing

567
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,360
it brings some reality to something

568
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,559
it inputs a memory inside in a sense

569
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,200
that makes you understand a little bit

570
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,080
more about things that you didn't know

571
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,400
about it may actually challenge your

572
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,880
perceptions of how the world works

573
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,720
for example

574
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,400
say that you were on youtube and you

575
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,000
came across a video of a person with

576
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,120
pink hair

577
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,880
and in this video the person on pink

578
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,600
hair is sharing how hard it is to be

579
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,360
someone with pink hair

580
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,280
because every time that they see you

581
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,159
walking you see them as a criminal

582
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,120
that every time that they are behind

583
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,440
someone who's walking that they see that

584
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,200
they cross the street they go in a store

585
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,799
or they clutch their bag a little bit

586
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,360
tighter and how that impacts this person

587
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,559
so much

588
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,320
because they just have pink hair and

589
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,919
they wish that the world knew that that

590
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,159
doesn't mean that we're a bad a person

591
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,559
and that they wish that the news the the

592
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:33,679
media

593
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,919
would actually see them for who they are

594
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,480
just people with pink hair and nothing

595
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,080
else nothing more just regular people

596
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,840
there's no difference just the fact that

597
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,840
they have one color difference

598
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,799
now the thing is is that

599
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,720
let's go back to the moment there's

600
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,320
someone behind you

601
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,559
you're walking down the street

602
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,720
a person with pink hair

603
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,360
and you're making this conscious

604
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,159
decision now in the prefrontal cortex

605
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,080
and remember those items right once

606
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,240
again it's across the street go into a

607
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,919
store

608
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,320
clutch your bag tighter the fourth

609
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,360
option is not to do anything

610
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,880
and at that moment

611
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,640
you're crossing you're thinking okay

612
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,000
probably the best thing is to go into

613
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,919
the store but then you think of that

614
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,240
video that youtube video that you saw

615
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,799
and how that person was and how real

616
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:27,919
they were

617
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,720
in this video talking about how hard it

618
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,039
is to be someone with pink hair because

619
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,640
they're always being perceived as a

620
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,799
criminal as a threat

621
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,440
and you realize like

622
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,120
oh

623
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,760
i think i was just about to do something

624
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,760
here that may have hurt this other

625
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,559
person behind me

626
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:49,440
maybe

627
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,440
maybe i shouldn't do anything

628
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,520
maybe this is the time where

629
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,280
you know i don't

630
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,360
i don't see this person as a perceived

631
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,240
threat and just test it out

632
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,520
and because i don't want to be the

633
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,960
person who's in the wrong i don't want

634
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,880
to hurt someone here i want to

635
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,120
understand this i want to have better

636
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,240
awareness of how my actions and my words

637
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,280
impact another individual

638
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,360
so you decide

639
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,039
you're going to do the fourth option

640
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,120
which is to not do anything

641
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,120
so you make your final decision the

642
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,039
prefrontal cortex sends a message back

643
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,960
to the amygdala letting it to know to

644
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,159
simmer down

645
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,240
versus when they would say to take an

646
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,840
action of a perceived threat it would

647
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,679
alert your entire body and you will take

648
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,880
the actions forward

649
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,240
now what i want to talk about is that

650
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,039
how we perceive threats is based around

651
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,279
socially constructed beliefs and the

652
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,440
thing as you can tell

653
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,880
is that they're not always real and true

654
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,840
if anything we have to just be aware of

655
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,919
who we are and how

656
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,279
we may be hurting one another by not

657
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,520
taking further look into

658
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,960
what we don't know

659
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,720
so it's really important for us to be

660
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,200
aware of that because this is also how

661
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,760
the public perceives people who may be a

662
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,360
criminal and this could be based on

663
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,840
their looks

664
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,640
or the way that they dress this could be

665
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,480
on all these different fronts but the

666
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,000
reality is that we have to be

667
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,559
understanding that this is how people

668
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,400
process threats

669
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,799
but there's always that possibility of

670
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,120
challenging it and that's the beautiful

671
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,200
thing here right because the mcdonald

672
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,279
you may not be able to challenge

673
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,559
but you are making a conscious decision

674
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,480
when you're in your prefrontal cortex

675
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,559
about the perceived threat

676
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,240
so the thing i want you all to know is

677
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,960
that we all have the ability to question

678
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,080
our biases but we have to also be okay

679
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,279
to be

680
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,960
all right to know that we don't know

681
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,159
everything

682
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:51,679
and that might be very uncomfortable

683
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,679
because insecurities running all of us

684
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,520
that's what's about being a human is

685
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,919
that we run on insecurities at times but

686
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,679
the reality is that when we get outside

687
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,279
our comfort bubble

688
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,640
we start learning about the world and

689
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,520
when we look at ourselves in the mirror

690
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,520
we really have to understand that it's

691
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,200
okay that we don't know everything

692
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,840
but we need to make that conscious

693
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,760
decision to do better

694
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,080
as an individual

695
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,880
so

696
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,279
one of the things that um hacking is not

697
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:24,000
a crime what we started doing is these

698
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,520
hashtag hacker stories project basically

699
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,840
it's people in the community that share

700
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,240
like why they became a hacker

701
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,080
the things that they love about it but

702
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,000
the issues that they have been facing

703
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,520
because of it

704
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,279
and we want these youtube videos to get

705
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:40,400
out there

706
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,480
in the public we want people to see it

707
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,159
because the thing is that

708
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,240
the public is very curious about us you

709
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,279
guys

710
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,120
like

711
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,440
they're really curious they want to know

712
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,840
what we look like they want to know

713
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,159
what how we talk they want to know what

714
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,559
we do outside of things because they're

715
00:25:58,559 --> 00:25:59,840
curious

716
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,080
we're curious human beings

717
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,440
and so that's the one thing is to

718
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,440
understand is that having these videos

719
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,600
sharing who you are why you do what you

720
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,559
do

721
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,240
that's really important but also to

722
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,440
share

723
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,080
why it impacts you that you don't have

724
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,480
rights or protections

725
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,840
i probably should have stated that at

726
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,080
the very beginning of this talk is that

727
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,760
the reason i'm giving this talk is

728
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,760
because we actually have no rights nor

729
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,279
protections

730
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,039
and that's why we have to talk about

731
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,799
this

732
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:29,840
so

733
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,679
now you know i'm not going to play the

734
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:32,880
video

735
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,679
but i will promise i'll post it later on

736
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,919
um but you can also go to hack is not a

737
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,679
crime and go to our youtube page to see

738
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:40,960
a bunch of them

739
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,799
um but i

740
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,640
i mean if you want to participate we

741
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,520
would love to have your video

742
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,400
so

743
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,799
step two now so now you know how human

744
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,320
behavior works when it comes to a

745
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,400
perceived threat

746
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,840
and also you know about social

747
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,520
constructive beliefs

748
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,799
now we're going to talk about how to

749
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,400
influence the public perception of

750
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,919
hackers

751
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,279
because the reality is that we've

752
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,200
already talked about this but socially

753
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,279
constructive beliefs stem from the media

754
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,679
and what is the media exactly for those

755
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,279
that do not know it's marketing it's pr

756
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,360
it's news it's

757
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,919
social media as well it's anything that

758
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,960
shares terminology

759
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,159
images

760
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,880
and shares stories

761
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,520
and so that's the thing to understand

762
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,080
now the if you're wondering

763
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,559
how is this a problem right now well

764
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,960
the public is scared of us and there's a

765
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,919
reason why they're scared of us is that

766
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,159
that when i type in ethical hacker

767
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,399
versus criminal hacker i get the exact

768
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,520
same pictures um and this is one of the

769
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,200
things is to understand is that we are

770
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,200
going to keep getting these images

771
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,440
unless we change and challenge people's

772
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,039
perceptions

773
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,039
so when we go to like for example a

774
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,320
conference

775
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,919
sometimes you'll see vendor boosts

776
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,840
having these images

777
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,600
and this is not the imagery

778
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,760
imagery that we need to be using right

779
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,720
now

780
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,760
also when we have marketing in infosec a

781
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,120
lot of times that they don't have

782
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,279
infosec experience before

783
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,919
joining an infosec company

784
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:19,760
so they market it

785
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,480
as hackers are the same as attackers so

786
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,120
they use the wrong terminology as well

787
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,279
so through images through terminology

788
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:30,480
the thing is is that um

789
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,720
we're basically gonna keep getting seen

790
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,600
as a malicious actor until we challenge

791
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,279
these terms and these images

792
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,679
um because it really does hurt when the

793
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:42,880
media doesn't know the difference

794
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,880
between a hacker and attacker because we

795
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,360
get these kind of stories

796
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,480
you know

797
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,080
we're not people that are going to be

798
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,000
threatening to leak patients therapy

799
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,960
notes we know that's a big no-no

800
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,720
and because we have

801
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,480
we would feel guilty

802
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,159
that's the difference if you think about

803
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:01,440
at the end of the day

804
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,919
who's going to be more on the criminal

805
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,159
side of the hacker community it's going

806
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:07,679
to be the ones that are not going to

807
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,120
feel guilty

808
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,880
they're not going to feel guilt for

809
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,840
doing things in a sense that can cause

810
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,399
harm to another individual

811
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:17,919
and that's the difference i say at the

812
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,559
end of the day it's the intent but also

813
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,960
do you feel guilty if you do something

814
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,600
that's in the wrong

815
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,480
so

816
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,799
the thing is is that we have to correct

817
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,279
the media politely

818
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,440
um and politely i mean nice and the

819
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,120
reason for that is because lots of time

820
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,200
people just don't know

821
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,559
they don't know at all so we have to

822
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,799
challenge that in a sense by letting

823
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,559
them know

824
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,399
so how can you change this type of

825
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,559
situation so if you're reading a news

826
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,880
story or watching a news story

827
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,640
you know remember to be kind before you

828
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,399
take any action okay remember have

829
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:55,520
empathy

830
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,679
they don't know better they just don't

831
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,159
know just assume that okay

832
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,799
but when you dm or comment publicly you

833
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:03,840
can also

834
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,240
uh just just remember that but it is

835
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,360
important to correct them so when uh the

836
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,559
news uses the wrong terminology you can

837
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,320
actually you know

838
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,480
post it on twitter be like

839
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,520
hey

840
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,679
techcrunch thank you for

841
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,880
using uh well not thank you be more like

842
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,159
hey techcrunch

843
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:26,080
i noticed i came across an article and

844
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,880
you use the term attacker when you mean

845
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,240
attacker

846
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,600
and i just want to let you know that

847
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,919
this really impacts the hacker community

848
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,919
because we're trying to get rights and

849
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,880
when you use the incorrect terminology

850
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,640
it prevents us from even having a

851
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,640
conversation about getting rights and

852
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,240
protections

853
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,960
so you can call it out on twitter but

854
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,520
just remember to be kind they don't know

855
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,559
better

856
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,240
and then see if you can set up a meeting

857
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,600
with them there's times where you can

858
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,840
actually talk to the news agency because

859
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,600
they want to know better they want to do

860
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,039
better because the job of a reporter

861
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,279
and an editor is to make sure they're as

862
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,440
accurate as possible so if they know

863
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,440
that they're using the wrong terminology

864
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,240
they have to fix that

865
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,399
but this isn't just once again about the

866
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,880
news but also if you see marketing using

867
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,200
the wrong things that we see quite a bit

868
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,440
in infosec so let in the know you're

869
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,919
using the wrong terminology the imagery

870
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,559
is hurtful we gotta let them know but

871
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,360
remember be kind

872
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,440
but also give them kudos when they get

873
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,000
it right whenever a news agency uses

874
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,240
their correct terminology i'm applauding

875
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,399
them i'm like thank you thank you for

876
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:39,039
taking the time to understand us

877
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,559
thank you so much for doing your

878
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:41,840
homework

879
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,519
and i really appreciate it so give them

880
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,360
kudos when they get it right because

881
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,960
everyone could always use a pat on the

882
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,440
back when they do something right

883
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,519
another way that you can do is contact

884
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,000
your local news agencies and send a

885
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,399
letter to the copy desk the copy desk

886
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,000
oversees all

887
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,240
things that get published but also sets

888
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,720
the tone so if there is a wrong verbiage

889
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,399
that they're using that they correct

890
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:07,200
that for all future cases of whenever

891
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,200
they're reporting on that subject so

892
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,200
sending letters like this this is an

893
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,360
example that some of us came together

894
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,919
and sent to the new york times

895
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,440
it's really important that we do this

896
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,880
but if you're one of those people that

897
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,159
does provide comments to the press about

898
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,640
the hacker community or anything around

899
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,840
infosec please remember to tell the

900
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,679
reporter

901
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,519
i always do this at the very beginning

902
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,200
of every conversation i have with the

903
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,720
reporter which is

904
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,720
by the way i just want you to know that

905
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,159
there is a

906
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,159
huge difference between a hacker and

907
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:43,760
attacker

908
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,679
and i really hope that you use the

909
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:48,320
correct terminology when you provide

910
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,919
um this article to your editor

911
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,600
and then it usually becomes a

912
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,519
conversation what do you mean there's a

913
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,600
difference and then i have to tell them

914
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,039
why there's a difference and then they

915
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,440
understand it and then that article

916
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,679
comes out and i see that they make sure

917
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,519
that throughout the entire article

918
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:08,080
they're using the right terminology and

919
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,919
it's amazing when you see that so

920
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:11,600
reporters they do listen that's their

921
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,559
job is to listen and take notes and

922
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,320
and to do better

923
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,559
when it comes to reporting

924
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,480
so keep that in mind and also within

925
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,200
your comments always remind the public

926
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,679
also in it that you know there's a

927
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:26,880
difference between a hacker and an

928
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,559
attacker and that's what i tend to do

929
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,360
quite often i want to reinforce this

930
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,918
always

931
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,120
now i know this is a little

932
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,799
controversial i don't really want to

933
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,399
tell people what to wear or anything

934
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,240
like this but i'm just suggesting that

935
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,000
it might be a good idea to not wear a

936
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,080
hoodie and the reason i say that is

937
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,159
because most of the time i get comments

938
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:49,440
all the time which is like oh

939
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,720
oh i thought all hackers were hoodies um

940
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,880
and the reality is that when i i

941
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,720
realized that when i stopped wearing a

942
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,039
hoodie when talking to the press i

943
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,720
realized that they also took me more

944
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,559
seriously too

945
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,640
um and so that's one of the things is to

946
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,720
think of so you can wear a suit if you

947
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,040
want i think that'd be great and

948
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,440
hilarious in many ways but it also shows

949
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,079
that you take it very seriously and that

950
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,079
and breaking away from that stereotype

951
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,800
that all hackers wear are hoodies and

952
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,960
live in a dark basement and maybe wear a

953
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,239
ski mask

954
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,960
so it's it's a good thing is to try to

955
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,119
challenge people's public perception by

956
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,280
knowing that what you wear does impact

957
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,239
and does matter

958
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,560
because the results of the media right

959
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,280
now if we don't change things is that

960
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,918
right now that 94 the forbes global 2000

961
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:41,520
list still does not have a vulnerability

962
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,440
disclosure policies

963
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,599
um that means that we don't know how to

964
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:46,800
contact them

965
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,520
um and that one out of four of hackers

966
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,359
don't report vulnerabilities when they

967
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,119
find it because they're worried about

968
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:56,079
facing a lawsuit potentially

969
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:58,320
um the other thing is that we have laws

970
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,960
that are preventing good hacking

971
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,520
like cfa and dmca

972
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,880
we also

973
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,040
were scared being prosecuted all the

974
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,000
time

975
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,800
but also the impact of it is that we're

976
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,920
also feeding into

977
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,040
having more malicious actors in this

978
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,200
situation and if you're wondering what

979
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,760
do you mean by that well the thing is is

980
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,280
that

981
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,599
there are people out there that when

982
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,520
they're told multiple times that they're

983
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,880
a bad person because they're a hacker

984
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,960
it gets to a point well it's like well

985
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,280
fine then then i guess i'm a bad person

986
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,839
and then they do more malicious things

987
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:38,880
um

988
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,960
and if you're like i'm so confused on

989
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,280
this let me explain this

990
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,359
um

991
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:48,560
when you have for example kids

992
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,240
and they're told over and over that

993
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,160
they're a bully

994
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,000
they start doing those things or when

995
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
you start telling a kid very early on

996
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,560
that they're stupid they believe in it

997
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,480
so they don't try as hard because they

998
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,560
believe that everyone is out already

999
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,720
sees them as this way so

1000
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,240
there's nothing they can do they try to

1001
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,320
challenge it but they give up

1002
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,520
and that's the thing we have to

1003
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,599
understand is that the situation that we

1004
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,839
have offers no protections

1005
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,480
um for trying to protect others and

1006
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,800
because of that it keeps us awake at

1007
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,280
night sometimes sometimes like insomnia

1008
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,720
because we're worried that we're gonna

1009
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,079
face something

1010
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:26,240
and we're worried about that and the

1011
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,359
thing is because we don't have

1012
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,440
protections this kind of gives it kind

1013
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,520
of like well fine you don't want me here

1014
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,560
in this space fine i'm just gonna do and

1015
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,040
take my skills and make money else

1016
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,560
elsewhere

1017
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,240
and this is the thing that we have to

1018
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,000
have probably in another talk one of

1019
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,240
these days a conversation of

1020
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,640
how do we bring these parties together

1021
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,599
once again if if a bad actor feels guilt

1022
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:51,839
and has some sort of guilt feelings i

1023
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,480
feel like we can't actually

1024
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,640
work with people like that um but if

1025
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,400
they don't feel guilty those are a lost

1026
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,440
cause

1027
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,359
um so the thing is is to understand is

1028
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:03,119
that the impact where we are without

1029
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,920
protections and also how this society

1030
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,480
has viewed us and seen us is that it's

1031
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,839
made it very very hard and tricky

1032
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:13,839
to have

1033
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:15,920
a sense of

1034
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,200
that we

1035
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,839
were okay to be here and exist

1036
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,440
and so that's one of the things that i

1037
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,520
want to talk about is like how do we

1038
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,000
influence legislation so we talked about

1039
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,400
how the media impacts us because it

1040
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,760
provides the socially constructed

1041
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,000
beliefs and reinforces them

1042
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,040
and now we're going to talk about

1043
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,480
legislation

1044
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,040
because it's legislation that also holds

1045
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,880
us back

1046
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,000
but before i do one quick note on here

1047
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,160
on that whole one out of four hackers do

1048
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,320
not report vulnerabilities i just want

1049
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,160
you all to know that

1050
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,800
um those i do report usually it's

1051
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,520
ignored or they receive a

1052
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,520
threat um and the reason i want everyone

1053
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,599
to understand this because i think that

1054
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:58,960
there are a good number of people in the

1055
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,800
hacker community that don't get this is

1056
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,760
that

1057
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,440
you have to understand the people that

1058
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,839
are running social media are marketing

1059
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,200
folks

1060
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,359
and marketing and security they're kind

1061
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:10,880
of siloed from each other they don't

1062
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,320
really talk with each other so when

1063
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,160
you're trying to reach out and usually

1064
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,200
what what we see is that we dm them on

1065
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,400
social media

1066
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,240
like on twitter or on linkedin saying

1067
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,079
hey i found a vulnerability i want you

1068
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,680
to know about because i didn't see you

1069
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,359
have vulnerable disclosure policies

1070
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:27,119
anywhere so i don't know who to contact

1071
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,200
so i'm contacting you what ends up

1072
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,480
happening is

1073
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,079
on the marketing team when they receive

1074
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:33,680
that they're going to bring it to their

1075
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,839
pr person

1076
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,200
first they're always going to bring it

1077
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,040
to their pr person the pr person then

1078
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,040
decides whether or not to bring it to

1079
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,640
the security team or bring it to their

1080
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,240
legal team

1081
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,079
so i want you all to know that this is

1082
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,440
one of the reasons also why

1083
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,119
vulnerability disclosure policies are so

1084
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,119
needed because if we don't have a

1085
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,960
contact email address we're going to

1086
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,800
just go through social media which sets

1087
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,720
us up where

1088
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,320
we're going to have a hard time anyway

1089
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,000
because marketing and security don't

1090
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,160
talk with each other most of the time so

1091
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,079
just do keep that in mind next time that

1092
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,000
you're trying to submit a vulnerability

1093
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,160
or to inform an organization about a

1094
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,079
vulnerability try not to do it through

1095
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,160
social media because it's owned by

1096
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,880
marketing team and your security team at

1097
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,280
that company most likely we wish that it

1098
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,720
was going to them

1099
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,880
so try whatever you can i know it takes

1100
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,960
a lot of time and energy and effort to

1101
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,880
try to contact someone on the security

1102
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,280
side of things or the engineering side

1103
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,280
that's another way you can go about it

1104
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,520
but dming them on social media it's

1105
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,280
going to lead you into a situation where

1106
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,800
you're not going to like

1107
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,880
um sometimes so i just want to throw it

1108
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,480
out there i know this is totally

1109
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,320
different from what i talk about in this

1110
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,720
talk but i just want people to know this

1111
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,400
because i've been in the marketing side

1112
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,240
of the house and i want you all to be

1113
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,320
aware of what happens usually when these

1114
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,000
things happen

1115
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,280
all right now let's go back into the

1116
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,359
talk on how to influence legislation

1117
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,680
so let's go into here

1118
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,800
so the thing that we all can realize is

1119
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,240
that we have laws right now that are

1120
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,720
preventing good hacking um because it's

1121
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,200
it was made to prevent attackers from

1122
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,119
doing something bad but the thing was

1123
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,960
that most of the time that we have a lot

1124
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,800
of issues with legislation all around

1125
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,000
the world is when we don't have

1126
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,160
representation so those aren't going to

1127
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,280
be impacted by laws that might be coming

1128
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,560
into the works they need to be heard if

1129
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,520
they're not heard they get hurt and so

1130
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,599
having representation matters but the

1131
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,359
thing is that most of our legislators

1132
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:31,280
don't know anything about information

1133
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,839
security they have absolutely no idea

1134
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,839
that there are hackers and attackers

1135
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:37,920
they think of us as one thing which is

1136
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,040
bad people

1137
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,960
so the thing is is that

1138
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,119
we have to get out there and talking to

1139
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:45,440
representatives we have to work with

1140
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,440
legislators because they don't know that

1141
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,400
we exist in a sense

1142
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,599
and that we have to challenge their

1143
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,440
socially constructive beliefs because

1144
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,440
the laws that are created were back in

1145
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,800
the 80s

1146
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,560
so we're in 2021 it's been quite some

1147
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,079
time and we need some changes and

1148
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:04,640
adjustments to showcase where we are

1149
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,760
today in society

1150
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,280
but the one that i want to always talk

1151
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,040
about with you is the cfa i'm not going

1152
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,720
to talk about the dmca i just know that

1153
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,800
it provides a chilling effect

1154
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,400
when it comes to us

1155
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,200
but the cfa so the computer fraud abuse

1156
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,599
act was passed in 1984.

1157
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,480
um but what it is is it's completely out

1158
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,560
of date um it offers prosecutors

1159
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,720
basically description of threatening

1160
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,960
huge potential fines and jail sentences

1161
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,119
for relatively underserving violations

1162
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,200
of the computer policy

1163
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,319
so the cfa israel punishes exceeding

1164
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:40,079
authorized access

1165
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,400
to a protected computer it's a phrase

1166
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,000
vague enough to inspire some really

1167
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,079
broad interpretations another flaw in

1168
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,160
the cfa is the redundant provisions that

1169
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,400
enable a person to be punished multiple

1170
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,440
times for the exact same crime these

1171
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,359
charges can be stacked one on top of

1172
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,760
another a resulting a threat of a higher

1173
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,920
cumulative fines but also jail time for

1174
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,680
the exact same violation

1175
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,680
this also allows prosecutors to bully

1176
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,920
defendants into accepting a deal in

1177
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,839
order to

1178
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:09,920
avoid facing a multitude of charges from

1179
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,000
a single solitary act

1180
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,760
it also plays a significant role in

1181
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,800
sentencing as well the ambiguity of a

1182
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,960
provision meant to toughen sentencing

1183
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,680
for

1184
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,520
basically repeat offenders of the cfa

1185
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,200
may in fact make it impossible for

1186
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,280
defendants to be sentenced based on what

1187
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,280
should be prior convictions

1188
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,800
but we're nothing more than multiple

1189
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,480
convictions for the same crime

1190
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,079
now the other thing to understand is

1191
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:35,359
that the cfa gives absolute rights to

1192
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:38,480
companies the right to sue

1193
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,400
so the thing you need to know is that

1194
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,280
hackers have more to fear from companies

1195
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,599
and states right now than

1196
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,400
the justice department at this time

1197
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,760
um so

1198
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,160
keep that in mind but the thing is it's

1199
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:52,960
these

1200
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,960
major companies too

1201
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,000
that are preventing us having changes as

1202
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:58,880
well

1203
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,880
and you may not know this but they are

1204
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,560
also known for lobbying to make sure

1205
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,599
that the cfa still exists because they

1206
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,160
want to make sure that they can go after

1207
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,520
employees that step in a situation that

1208
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,440
they don't like

1209
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,280
and this is one of the reasons why we

1210
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,960
had something called aaron's law that

1211
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,960
was trying to get passed

1212
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,079
but it was blocked because of major tech

1213
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:23,520
lobbyists

1214
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,440
making sure that the cfa does not have

1215
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,760
any amendments or changes to it

1216
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,440
so the thing to understand is that the

1217
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,599
cfa has been used against our community

1218
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:34,800
quite a bit um it's it's really vague it

1219
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,800
does have redundancies

1220
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,040
and the reason that the cfa was actually

1221
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,960
created to understand was because ronald

1222
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,359
reagan watched a special premiere of war

1223
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:46,000
games and he freaked out he panicked

1224
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,920
he's like we gotta do something about

1225
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,960
these hackers when he means attackers

1226
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,560
and we need to do something about them

1227
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,800
fast and that's how the cfa was created

1228
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,800
was based on fear

1229
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,920
of some socially constructed belief

1230
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,880
that he watched in a movie

1231
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,800
you see how powerful socially

1232
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,720
constructed beliefs can be

1233
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,680
they can hurt people so much not just

1234
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,359
one individual we can talk about

1235
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:13,520
communities of people

1236
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,079
because the reality is that

1237
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,400
we don't have representation

1238
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,079
and we're going to keep seeing

1239
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:22,000
situations like this happen if we don't

1240
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,200
have representation at the top

1241
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,440
and so that's why the cfa still exists

1242
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,160
to this day is because one the socially

1243
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,400
constructed beliefs are still there

1244
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,280
two

1245
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,240
also our media hasn't changed too much

1246
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,319
on that front and we still need to do

1247
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:39,280
that

1248
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,319
a third

1249
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,359
is that we have major tech lobbyists

1250
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:45,280
companies out there that don't want the

1251
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,440
cfa to have any changes because that

1252
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,119
vagueness helps them

1253
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:51,440
and that fear helps them

1254
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,000
go after their own employees that do

1255
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,319
something that they don't like

1256
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,560
so please keep that in mind that that's

1257
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,480
why we have to work with the media

1258
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,240
organizations

1259
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,640
like tech companies to try to change

1260
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,079
this because

1261
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:08,480
the lobbyists are definitely preventing

1262
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,000
this change

1263
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
now the other thing to note is that the

1264
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,560
cfa does have some extreme dire

1265
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,280
situations that do happen

1266
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,640
and

1267
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,119
i just briefly just want to point out

1268
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,200
someone that

1269
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,960
had something terrible happen to them

1270
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,920
because of the cfa

1271
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,560
you may not know of aaron's works but i

1272
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,400
want to tell you a little about aaron

1273
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,520
swartz because it's his story

1274
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,720
that also made this talk happen

1275
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,760
so in 2011 carmen ortez the u.s

1276
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,839
attorney's office charged schwartz with

1277
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:46,160
hacking into the mit computer network to

1278
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,319
download millions of scholarly articles

1279
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:50,400
from jstor

1280
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,359
it was an act of civil disobedience but

1281
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:55,520
it was meant to protest the restricted

1282
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:58,400
access to research funded by taxpayers

1283
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,960
he believed that this stuff research

1284
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,640
should be open to the public since the

1285
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,000
public is paying and funding for it

1286
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,839
but the thing was that the u.s attorney

1287
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:09,280
decided

1288
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,960
they wanted to make him

1289
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,720
an example

1290
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,040
and this is the thing that i hate to see

1291
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,280
is when companies and governments do

1292
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,119
this to people

1293
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:21,359
when we make people into examples to

1294
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:23,520
scare other people

1295
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,839
it works i get it it works but the other

1296
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:28,480
thing that it is disgusting

1297
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,240
and disturbing on so many levels

1298
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,240
so the thing is is that the u.s attorney

1299
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,680
brought charges that carried a maximum

1300
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,720
penalty of 35 years in prison

1301
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,960
for aaron and including 1 million in

1302
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,920
fines now the reason that he was able to

1303
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,960
be charged with 35 years in prison was

1304
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,440
because of how the cfa was ran that it

1305
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,319
allows you to stack upon stack that you

1306
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:53,839
can be charged multiple times for the

1307
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:56,160
same offense

1308
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,079
but i want to hold right there and also

1309
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:00,079
have you understand one thing

1310
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:02,240
so

1311
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,119
he him doing this does not cause any

1312
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:07,280
harm it doesn't hurt an individual it

1313
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,839
doesn't physically hurt another

1314
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:11,440
individual but yeah he was facing 35

1315
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,800
years of prison

1316
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,000
now

1317
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,079
if you murdered someone

1318
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:20,640
it is 25 years minimum in prison

1319
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,319
so you kind of can understand when

1320
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:24,720
people are upset about the cfa

1321
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,920
a and the redundancies and how they can

1322
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,240
charge so many years for something that

1323
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:34,079
does not even equate to even close of

1324
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:35,920
prison time

1325
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,680
murdering someone is taking someone's

1326
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,400
life that is hurting an individual that

1327
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,480
hurts when you when you kill someone

1328
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,240
you're you're harming the rest of the

1329
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,440
family

1330
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,599
you're hurting the friends you're doing

1331
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:49,200
a lot of harm

1332
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,800
to society when someone murders someone

1333
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:53,839
but

1334
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:57,599
what he did was that even close no not

1335
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:00,000
at all but yet he was facing 35 years in

1336
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,760
prison

1337
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,040
you see how absurd the cfa is

1338
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,599
but you also have to understand how

1339
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:11,359
insane it must have been for him

1340
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:13,680
he was looking at a legal battle that

1341
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,240
didn't have an end date at all

1342
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,880
it was 17 months into this

1343
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,599
and he had no set trial date he didn't

1344
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,440
know when it was going to end

1345
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,319
he was 26

1346
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:28,480
and it became hopeless for his own

1347
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,599
future

1348
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:32,839
because all he wanted to do was provide

1349
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:36,000
research that was funded by taxpayers

1350
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,640
money for the world to have access to it

1351
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,720
and

1352
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:46,640
the saddest part about it was that

1353
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,280
it must have hurt him a lot i could not

1354
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,079
imagine how dark it must have been for

1355
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:52,960
him

1356
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,119
to feel like you have no control of your

1357
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:57,440
life and that for people are seeing you

1358
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,319
as this horrible monster when in reality

1359
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:02,559
what you were doing is not even it's not

1360
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:04,559
being a horrible monster you're trying

1361
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:06,079
to do something right it was kind of

1362
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:09,280
like a hacktivist situation

1363
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,000
wasn't going to hurt anyone

1364
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,680
but unfortunately we lost him

1365
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,440
and

1366
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,599
and you have to understand that

1367
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:21,280
yes the federal prosecutors went on to

1368
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,800
drop the charges

1369
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,000
great but they should have done that a

1370
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,839
long time ago

1371
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:27,440
and it was

1372
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,839
his family that also believes that it

1373
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:31,520
was the government's prosecution that

1374
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,319
contributed to his decision to end his

1375
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:36,079
own life

1376
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:37,520
and the thing is that we have to

1377
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,400
recognize that we need to fix this

1378
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,200
situation

1379
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,200
and that's why aaron's law was something

1380
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,200
that was important it was written after

1381
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,559
his passing

1382
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:50,720
to make sure that no one ever has to

1383
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,040
face what he had to face but it was

1384
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,440
blocked

1385
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,400
so the thing is the reason why we need

1386
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,240
improvements legislation is so then all

1387
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,000
forbes global 2000 have some sort of

1388
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,839
vulnerability disclosure policies and

1389
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:07,359
that 100 of hackers uh can report

1390
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:09,440
vulnerabilities that laws encourage good

1391
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,680
hacking and that there wouldn't be any

1392
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,599
more prosecutive hackers and decrease

1393
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:16,720
the number of malicious actors

1394
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,240
and there are things that you can do

1395
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,680
right now

1396
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:23,599
which is be bold be kind go vote

1397
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:26,160
and know who your local representatives

1398
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,680
because it's those representatives that

1399
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,280
are going to make these decisions for

1400
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,920
you and you can find it right here

1401
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,599
there's a reason why they're preventing

1402
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,680
you from voting and why there's all

1403
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,520
these voting restriction laws coming

1404
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,319
into process is because voting matters

1405
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:42,319
your vote counts

1406
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:44,079
and that's why by putting down

1407
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:45,440
restrictions

1408
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,240
it

1409
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,680
it's preventing change from happening

1410
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,000
so it's important to talk to your

1411
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,240
representatives they're representing you

1412
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:54,960
as

1413
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,359
as the population that they serve

1414
00:50:57,359 --> 00:50:58,160
so

1415
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,000
set up a call with them

1416
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,880
and or get a meeting in person let us

1417
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,119
know contact hack not crime

1418
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:07,200
and we'll come in and we'll join you you

1419
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,559
shouldn't go out alone but the thing is

1420
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:09,520
we need to start having these

1421
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,359
conversations we need legislators to

1422
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:14,000
step up and be strong for us because

1423
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,839
we're trying to be strong to protect and

1424
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,920
serve this country it's time for them to

1425
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,079
do the same

1426
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:21,680
now the other thing is to collaborate

1427
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,599
with organizations so

1428
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:25,200
volunteering is one of those things but

1429
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,240
i really want to talk about

1430
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,079
vulnerability disclosure every single

1431
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:30,720
organization should have one

1432
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,240
because vulnerability disclosure will

1433
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,000
reduce your breaches it provides a

1434
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
diverse background to find the bugs that

1435
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,400
your security team is going to miss

1436
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,079
but it also allows bilateral trust

1437
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:41,760
between organizations and hackers to

1438
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,440
keep security in check

1439
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,920
and also let's be real you cannot rely

1440
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,720
on scanners to know what to patch

1441
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:49,839
but the thing is if you do have

1442
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:51,680
vulnerability disclosure policies or you

1443
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,119
don't have it make sure to state what's

1444
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:54,800
in scope what's out of scope don't write

1445
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,319
for attorneys right for english learners

1446
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:57,839
because most of the time we don't

1447
00:51:57,839 --> 00:51:59,119
understand what you're writing and then

1448
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:01,040
we get in trouble so the thing is really

1449
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,640
important is to write it for english

1450
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,079
learners don't write for another

1451
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,359
training to understand because we're not

1452
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:07,200
attorneys we're researchers

1453
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,119
contact information who do we contact so

1454
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:11,119
we don't have to dm someone when the

1455
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:13,119
marketing team finds it and we want

1456
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:15,440
communications updated very

1457
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,760
often now it's also important is that if

1458
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:18,880
you're running your own vulnerability

1459
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,240
disclosure policies make sure you have a

1460
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,400
dedicated person to manage prioritize

1461
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,760
and task it

1462
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,920
um and if you can't look into platforms

1463
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,319
that can such as bug crowd hacker one

1464
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:30,000
and synax

1465
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
now if you are trying to fix your

1466
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,920
disclosure policies go ahead and check

1467
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,599
out disclose.io

1468
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:37,839
um it's a great resource to start that

1469
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:39,119
blueprint of having your own

1470
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:40,640
vulnerability disclosure policies at

1471
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,559
your organization but also they have a

1472
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:44,160
listing of all the companies that are

1473
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,160
practicing

1474
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,599
basically

1475
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:49,520
safe harbor in a sense so it's important

1476
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,960
for you to also know about this list and

1477
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,079
if there's any companies that are

1478
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:54,000
missing on there go ahead and add it to

1479
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:54,880
it

1480
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,280
and besides disclosure once again it's

1481
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:00,160
really important to volunteer and give

1482
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,480
such as to the eff i'm the calvary cert

1483
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,920
cc cti league disco.io hackies.crime

1484
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,760
because we're working to change things

1485
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,520
and we have to work together to change

1486
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,880
things

1487
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,480
so overall summary i know i went a

1488
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,800
little bit over time here is get

1489
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,720
involved check out hackie's not a

1490
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,040
crime.org become an advocate with us if

1491
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,720
you want volunteer and support

1492
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,160
organizations that are out there in the

1493
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,160
community but also note that

1494
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,839
we have to work with the press and we

1495
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:27,200
need to work with legislators to get

1496
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,720
about a change

1497
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,880
but remember whatever you do publicly

1498
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,960
and behind closed doors just remember to

1499
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,640
have empathy and be kind because most of

1500
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,960
the time people just don't know better

1501
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,960
and it's up to us to inform them

1502
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,400
and just remember

1503
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,760
the one thing i want you to take away

1504
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,520
from this entire talk

1505
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,960
is that the change starts with you and

1506
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,440
me i know that sounds like really corny

1507
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,680
in many ways but the reality is that is

1508
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,119
true

1509
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:55,680
let's honor aaron swartz life

1510
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,920
by doing something to prevent so there

1511
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,079
will never ever be another case like

1512
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:02,079
error in swartz

1513
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:03,440
we owe it

1514
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,240
