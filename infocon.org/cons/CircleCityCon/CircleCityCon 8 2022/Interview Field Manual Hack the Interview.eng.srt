33
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,119
another

34
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,920
it uh is an interesting role and my my

35
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,280
role getting to here has been an

36
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,439
interesting journey i started in 1993

37
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,640
with computers i.t at that time i was

38
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,159
living in poughkeepsie new york which

39
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,880
was ibm big blue country i showed a very

40
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,119
strong interest in computers and even in

41
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,400
high school when there was this very

42
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,560
early thing called internet we just got

43
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,479
done using a lot of prodigy aol and

44
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,040
compuserve but this this uh global

45
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,479
internet thing seem to be catching on a

46
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,320
little bit and unfortunately it's died

47
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,159
down and nobody's heard of it since then

48
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:46,960
but

49
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,200
i started talking at a lot of

50
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,360
conferences and local conferences more

51
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,799
like you know rotary groups and things

52
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,960
like that is the kid that

53
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,960
helps his parents company um do

54
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,840
communication stuff about computers they

55
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,840
had a pr and consulting firm at the time

56
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,600
and i started doing some website design

57
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,960
and talking about how this this thing

58
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,159
called the web and the internet was

59
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,360
going to be huge and people said you

60
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,038
know that's great but we couldn't get

61
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,239
our computers to turn on for our

62
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,959
businesses so i started kind of really

63
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,680
working at that point from that idea to

64
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,200
help individuals with their computers

65
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,640
and i had a company called computer

66
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,720
house calls where i would go to small

67
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,720
businesses and individuals and help set

68
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,720
up their computers in the 90s

69
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,280
migrate from windows 3. to 3.3.1 to 3.11

70
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,239
and then

71
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,560
nt4o and from nt 3.51 so my history with

72
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,239
windows goes way back and that's really

73
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,920
always been my strength of being able to

74
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,200
look at the marketplace and say hey

75
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,480
there's a lot of windows computer a lot

76
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,040
of people need help from that i continue

77
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,760
to kind of build a local rapport the

78
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,959
young computer

79
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,040
company owner that can help solve your

80
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,400
computer problem to keep your business

81
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,800
operational and this led to doing some

82
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,400
work with some individuals that did work

83
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,480
with very large corporate companies

84
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,440
doing corporate video and doing um slide

85
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,920
deck presentation design and graphics uh

86
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,920
so a lot of this stuff that's you know

87
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,760
in my roots kind of intercepted over the

88
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,760
years continued to build but you know i

89
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,120
got to really kind of help support and

90
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,519
see how these businesses supported

91
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,360
companies like merrill lynch sure enough

92
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,560
merrill lynch was like hey you know

93
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,560
we're doing a lot of these conferences

94
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,000
all over the world can you come on board

95
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,400
and help as a contractor and help build

96
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,239
out our networks and i would drop into

97
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,159
locations such as puerto rico new york

98
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,640
city l.a build out a network for five

99
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,560
days in an event or conference center or

100
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,760
a hotel

101
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,680
rip it all down so i'd run cat5 all

102
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,280
night put everything together a couple

103
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,799
days later tear it all down to build

104
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,640
these secure networks that allowed their

105
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,400
executives and investors and everybody

106
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,319
to kind of speak these conferences

107
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,000
um and that kind of ran its course it

108
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,239
was you can only do that for so long and

109
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,000
maryland incidentally as a company kind

110
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,599
of ran its course as well and when it

111
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,519
went into bank of america i kind of

112
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:50,879
separated with that i really want to get

113
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,879
back to my roots of

114
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:53,760
um

115
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,519
just the hacker roots just me that kid

116
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:56,959
that pulled up our computers and figured

117
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,640
out how things worked and made it better

118
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,239
by putting it back to you know back in

119
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,760
pieces and so i started yet another

120
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,840
company called the digital forensic

121
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,080
group in new york city focused on

122
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,599
incident response computer

123
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,200
investigations

124
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,680
and doing a lot of forensics around

125
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,599
technology and legal services and that

126
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,519
was actually one of my customers back in

127
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,279
poughkeepsie at the time even when i was

128
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,320
living in new york city he had

129
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,839
transitioned to doing audio-visual

130
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,759
forensics had pulled me in and said hey

131
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,360
doug i think i have a case for you do

132
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,800
you want to do some forensics i said

133
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,919
absolutely

134
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,440
got involved doing that and that one

135
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,199
thing leads to another

136
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,840
i spent a lot of time at this point on

137
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,080
different networking boards and getting

138
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,280
out there and talking things on like

139
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,759

140
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,840

people at another company called craft

157
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,680
kennedy where we then pitched bringing

158
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,039
in a whole

159
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,320

proactive to reactive legal governance

163
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,600

moved to denver about four years ago to

165

get out of the chaos of new york city

166
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,600
and uh really had to try to find my

167
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,039
roots of what i wanted to do left craft

168
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,360
kennedy and found a company called kibu

169
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,720
i'd known a lot of people there because

170
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,560
even when i was at craft kennedy we were

171
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,320
kind of business partners doing some

172
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,039
forensics work and kiva brought me on to

173
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,880
build out their denver office at that

174
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,400
time i got to know some folks at this

175
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,479
company called special counsel where i

176
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,320
was giving them work for doing incident

177
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,479
response work i went on board later with

178
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,320
them and helped build that out

179
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,000
while i was doing that i was thoroughly

180
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,360
enjoying it and about a year and a half

181
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,520
ago got to see a big office open down

182
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,600
the road for me from this company splunk

183
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,199
went out reached out to some of the

184
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,800
folks there after they had a big open

185
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,240
house and had like a meet-up group

186
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,759
talking about security and some other

187
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:02,560
things

188
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,800
talked to some other people and went out

189
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,840
and worked

190
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,199
and got to god it was able to kind of

191
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,479
build some connections to get a job

192
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,479
there so that long oratory is kind of

193
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,080
has a theme that i want you all to think

194
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,319
about as you look at this presentation

195
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,400
and as you go through your career and

196
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,639
quite frankly it's networking

197
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,000
as much as i'm going to show you about

198
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,600
how to do things about posting things on

199
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,479
linkedin and your resume

200
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,639
the the word of mouth the brand that you

201
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,000
build for yourself becomes more

202
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,840
important than anything else and with

203
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,759
all these jobs and even the last couple

204
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,759
corporate jobs you know i was kind of

205
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,280
already in the door by the time i

206
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,720
already had applied i built those

207
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,720
relationships i had already kind of

208
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,479
hacked into these organizations a little

209
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,240
bit to build the relationships and

210
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,919
confidence that when i needed something

211
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,759
or wanted something i was able to get

212
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,680
that job because i'd already built the

213
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,240
tracks and build those relationships so

214
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,680
the really one thing that i want you to

215
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,039
think about is getting out there and

216
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,919
networking things like this is and so

217
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,199
important when we all get to meet

218
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,479
together again it's going to be even

219
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:01,440
better because i think we're going to

220
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,360
see what we lost over this past year is

221
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,759
this ability to you do lobby con or

222
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,440
hallway car on or

223
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,360
bar con or whatever we do outside of the

224
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,800
main talk tracks

225
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,800
is so important for getting jobs and

226
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,080
building these connections with us

227
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,479
because we are social creatures and

228
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,240
being able to say hey i know somebody

229
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,759
that might be a good role for a job is

230
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,440
going to be incredibly important so i

231
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,280
certainly want to give shout outs to the

232
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,039
colorado equal security community it's

233
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,280
another community here in colorado that

234
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,039
i'm heavily involved with so rob rack

235
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,960
and alex wood or two folks that really

236
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,120
helped champion that they have a

237
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,360
podcast and slack channel buying local

238
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,520
stuff that you have within your town

239
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,400
community wherever but get involved meet

240
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,000
up groups b-sides o-wasps um teaching

241
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,919
volunteering at these conferences just

242
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,599
getting out there speaking just putting

243
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:48,560
yourself out there is going to be

244
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,400
important and i know it's hard for me as

245
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,400
an extrovert it's not that hard but i

246
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,000
know for other people that are less

247
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,280
extroverted or just completely

248
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,039
introverted it's going to be difficult

249
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,720
but if you can find ways to connect with

250
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,160
people and again kind of build your

251
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,280
brand even if you have to do it

252
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,879
anonymously through hacker channels

253
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,120
great but you know

254
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,120
build your brand of what kind of person

255
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,160
you are and what you're going to bring

256
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,879
to the table so again while primarily

257
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,800
most of my history in life has been

258
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,520
focused on blue teaming and and i've

259
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,520
done my fair share of offensive security

260
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,759
and i'm a hacker you know full stop so

261
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,599
kind of what does that mean i i take to

262
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,440
tend to look at things as processes and

263
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,280
then find ways to exploit them to my

264
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,319
benefit why not right you know it pisses

265
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,080
off a lot of my my really good red

266
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,479
teamers that are hands on keyboard

267
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,640
oscp every cert that you can imagine and

268
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,399
i would struggle with that stuff but it

269
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,000
frustrates them that i can almost walk

270
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,399
into any situation and just sit down at

271
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,839
a table and kind of start getting

272
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,919
information and social engineer my way

273
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,680
that's the way i think about things so i

274
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,200
think about taking things apart

275
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,200
understanding each piece of why it works

276
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,040
and looking at new ways to leverage the

277
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,200
pieces of the process to get more so i

278
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,720
start thinking about that in the terms

279
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,560
of you know getting jobs and kind of

280
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,560
going through this process in this order

281
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,480
and mapping it to the attack chain to

282
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,560
say wait there's a commonality here that

283
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,120
we can follow in trying to get the jobs

284
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,040
that you want and really so you want to

285
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,040
think about this exercise as your

286
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,279
ultimate goal your ultimate goals and

287
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,160
objectives is to get that job offer so

288
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,160
when you create a repeatable process and

289
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,240
you operationalize it you increase your

290
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,560
chances of success you reduce your

291
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,640
stress by not recreating the wheel each

292
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,959
time then you tend to make less mistakes

293
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,399
and you really get to then focus on

294
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,920
what's more important about this all

295
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,600
this and again it's finding that right

296
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,760
cultural fit so when you reduce the

297
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,279
noise and you can really find the things

298
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,040
that it's going to connect with you

299
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,279
in an organization

300
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,800
it's going to be just help you get that

301
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,160
kind of better fit because i think

302
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,519
cultural fits then one of the most

303
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,279
important things you can look for when

304
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,959
you're going to get to a job and if you

305
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,480
can reduce some of the stress of the

306
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,560
other areas of the process it's going to

307
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,640
allow you to find those fits better

308
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,160
and certainly note that the attack chain

309
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,399
is kind of linear and you will jump back

310
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,160
to earlier stages with each person you

311
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,760
talk to and kind of run microplays

312
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,880
against them

313
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,399
of the same attack

314
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,240
so some basics and recommendations as

315
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,680
you kind of frame up this and what

316
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,839
you're doing and again i really can't

317
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,600
emphasize further your best place to

318
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,279
find leads is networking like i said

319
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,360
that's been my theme my entire career of

320
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,360
just getting out there talking to people

321
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,880
building my brand and so whether that's

322
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,360
being done in person or online do try to

323
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,079
get yourself out there um and finding

324
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,720
the orgs that you want to work with the

325
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,399
people that you can leverage to find out

326
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,320
more information about the organization

327
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,839
and really getting to know the roles in

328
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,440
the culture

329
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,839
understand too that the job job

330
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,200
requisitions that you're going to see

331
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,399
out there and some of these job

332
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,120
descriptions are often from hr people

333
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,800
and maybe some hiring managers and some

334
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,079
people over here it becomes this

335
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,519
frankenstein's monster from past post

336
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,800
look i've done it myself when i'm

337
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,079
putting together a job wreck it might

338
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,680
take a little bit of an ir person over

339
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,600
here maybe an intern here and try to put

340
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,680
something together and i'd admittedly

341
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,839
make mistakes when i posted things so do

342
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,440
understand that overall it's kind of a

343
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,800
messy process

344
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,600
um

345
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,079
and they are what they are but when we

346
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,000
talk about it when we weaponize and when

347
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,480
you have to submit it

348
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,160
um you know you think about how that

349
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,279
process is going to go that you're going

350
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,320
to want to kind of have to make sure

351
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,000
things are kind of tuned

352
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,399
because ultimately you want to make sure

353
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,399
that it's going to land on the right

354
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,720
place so you do want to know know how to

355
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,240
kind of again reduce some of that noise

356
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,760
that's in there and really only focus on

357
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,880
what matters

358
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,120
always keep your resume up to date so

359
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,120
whether it's once a month once every six

360
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,279
months whatever your cadence is i don't

361
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,839
care it must be a living document don't

362
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,839
wait until you need it to have to go

363
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,360
build it and then submit it you know

364
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,519
keep it updated all the time

365
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,720
having a stale

366
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,480
resume is always a rookie move at all

367
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,000
stages of your career you know sometimes

368
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,160
i might found that splunk they they've

369
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,680
had even the last year hey this might be

370
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,680
a good role would you want to

371
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,120
talk to the hiring manager about them

372
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,640
like oh yeah and they say well you know

373
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,160
this is very corporate we're a publicly

374
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,160
traded company there is a process you

375
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,519
have to apply for it i'm like i'm

376
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,440
already here they're like we understand

377
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,720
there's a process

378
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,959
so i've had to reapply even using my

379
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,040
existing splunk resume on another splunk

380
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,920
job um just to even talk to a hiring

381
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,240
manager about what that role might be so

382
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,680
i've always had to keep my resume

383
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,120
updated because i always keep on the

384
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,440
lookout for other things that might be a

385
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,880
better fit even with inside an

386
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,279
organization so again keep that up to

387
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,440
date and this goes along the themes of

388
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,880
always be interviewing you know finding

389
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,399
new things that are out there you don't

390
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,240
know what you don't know at times so i

391
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,760
encourage my staff to see what's out

392
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,040
there and talk to other people and

393
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,440
really it serves two purpose first it

394
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,720
gives me you know great feedback to me

395
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,320
um on market and competitive

396
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,920
intelligence that i'm not gonna get

397
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,839
anywhere else and i'm not saying like go

398
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,160
out there and just try to like you know

399
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,519
nefariously get information on

400
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,440
competition i'm not just it's the idea

401
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,560
that you know

402
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,240
when you're recruiting directly and

403
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,160
directly these people have to show some

404
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,399
cards and as a manager i want to know

405
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,560
what others are doing and it might give

406
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,399
me some ideas because

407
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,920
they might come back and say hey look

408
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,240
doug um you know

409
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,279
there's not such a big focus of money or

410
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,440
pto or training on this and maybe they

411
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,800
come back and say

412
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,320
well you know this is what's important

413
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,760
to me they're doing something culturally

414
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,040
that matters to me i would love to see

415
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,480
you do that and that matters more than

416
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,920
some of these other things you know

417
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,440
again maybe it's unlimited pto maybe

418
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,279
it's you're not i don't know what it is

419
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,880
until people come back and see what else

420
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,120
is out there bring that to my attention

421
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,680
so i can incorporate it into their their

422
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,360
jobs and my the roles i'm building for

423
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,279
them because ultimately i want a more

424
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,519
happier and productive employee so if

425
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,920
they can bring new ideas to me i want to

426
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,000
help figure that out

427
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,920
so as you think about all this too you

428
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,920
know think about the perspective from a

429
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,920
hiring manager for me i want to find

430
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,320
good talent and not lose them so for me

431
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,160
to see value from a higher can take

432
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,920
anywhere from six to 12 months maybe

433
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,880
more and that churn costs money so if i

434
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,560
know that people are getting into the

435
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,959
right role sooner and quicker and maybe

436
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,320
even sometimes having to leave if they

437
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,079
don't that's fine you know again the

438
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,680
part of this too is also not staying

439
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,880
places and roles that you're not

440
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,839
comfortable with um so the whole process

441
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,760
i think for the industry can be improved

442
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,519
and so the better that we we get rid of

443
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,600
some of the mechanics and connect on the

444
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,680
people we're all going to serve better

445
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,639
um and what it all boils down to after

446
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,880
you go through all this process is

447
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,480
the key point is to be honest with

448
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,760
yourself and with the people that you're

449
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,040
interviewing with

450
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,240
that was going to be the biggest

451
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,639
takeaway um i mean guess what i'm laying

452
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,079
out is basically social engineering to

453
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,800
get a job just fine just don't lie about

454
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,440
it

455
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,120
you better be able to show up if you do

456
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,240
get that job you better be able to show

457
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,399
up on day one humble hungry and ready to

458
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,440
learn

459
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,760
if you bs your way into the door it's

460
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,160
career suicide so smooth

461
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,639
network yes lie no

462
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,639
all right so let's dive into each step

463
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,399
here

464
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,800
first we're going to look at recon so

465
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,480
let's assume that you've

466
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,079
jumped ahead uh let's assume you've

467
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,440
already picked out your target at this

468
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,360
point you've been getting out there

469
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,440
you've seen what companies are hiring or

470
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,120
that you may want to work for

471
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,040
you've gone on google you've done some

472
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,040
research linkedin you do your hostnet on

473
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,680
them understand how this company looks

474
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,680
how they talk the language that they use

475
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,920
you know sometimes in cyber security or

476
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,760
information security things are not

477
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,120
always interchangeable or they are

478
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,320
they're tuned differently you want to

479
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,240
understand what language that

480
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,079
organization does to describe the

481
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,680
functions for what it's trying to

482
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,600
outcome as far as a business you want to

483
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,760
align yourself with that get a no for

484
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,240
the feels the color palettes let your

485
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,920
brain process that all drink from the

486
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,160
fire hose and even when i was applying

487
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,160
at splunk i took their colors and i put

488
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,680
it into my

489
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,360
cover letter just to create that feeling

490
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,480
i really want to make sure it was a

491
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,240
human connection that they had a feeling

492
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,920
for me that i saw

493
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,720
their culture um you know go to places

494
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,360
such as yahoo finance market watch and

495
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,759
look at their company's financials see

496
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,680
what analysts are saying about them you

497
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,199
want to know how this company makes

498
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,519

499
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,959
publicly held

500
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,120
are their financials strong or weak had

501
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,279
they had an ipo and when are they

502
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,839

and you get in and within one year

507
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,440
they're swallowed by another company how

508
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,040
will that impact you you need to think

509
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,040
about this and this year this is going

510
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,079
to happen a lot there's going to be a

511
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,360
ton of m and

512
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,680
activity both products and services so

513
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,519
as you if you're out there looking think

514
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,040
about these things that if you want to

515
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,600
be this place for multiple years

516
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,720
ask about these things through the

517
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,320
process as well because you want to know

518
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,079
where this company is going to be when

519
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,959
you want to reach your goals

520
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,880
get to know the people that work at this

521
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,120
company too within your network talk to

522
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,279
them get a feel for them i usually reach

523
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,680
out to people on my network that

524
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,279
you know that

525
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,959
want to that work there to help me get

526
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,240
in the door right

527
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,480
um first that person will get a bonus

528
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,399
for referring me most most organizations

529
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,079
now are very lucrative about doing that

530
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,079
where if i find somebody and there's an

531
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,440
open wreck

532
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,600
it's incentive for me to go to try to

533
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,120
get somebody hired but i'm going to be a

534
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,839
good filter for them so

535
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,079
now i have an insider kind of an insider

536
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,560
threat if i can find them to bring me in

537
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,519
the door

538
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,199
but this also does give you a leg up in

539
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,799
the process as being a referral because

540
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,640
recruiters and hiring managers are going

541
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,480
to just naturally tend to give eyes to

542
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,919
talent brought in by someone else in

543
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,599
this company so again i've got my

544
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,959
insider threat helping me give a little

545
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,640
intel about who's going to be doing what

546
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,559
and where but it's also going to help

547
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,799
have somebody advocate for me

548
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:19,919
um

549
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,119
as you're going through this and you're

550
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,880
finding the job rex see if you can also

551
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,400
find out who the hiring manager is so it

552
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,559
might be i've asked the people that say

553
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,319
hey look i'm looking to shop job

554
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,480
requisition who's the hiring manager i

555
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,679
mean this could be really important

556
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,600
because then i'll do some further ocenid

557
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,600
on that individual i'll find out about

558
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,120
them i'll find videos of them if they've

559
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,360
been speaking in public maybe blogs get

560
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,360
to know their body language their

561
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,480
cadence

562
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,000
maybe a regional slang i want to kind of

563
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,600
get to know them from afar so when i

564
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,520
talk to them it's not like i'm feeling

565
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,799
this is the first time i've ever seen

566
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,480
her talk to that person

567
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,160
and you know

568
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,520
ultimately as you go through this whole

569
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,280
process too is you say you know as

570
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,039
you're talking to these these people in

571
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,960
these organizations one of my mentors

572
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,039
gave me really good advice i said doug

573
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,240
when you're going through the interview

574
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,240
process think to yourself if i got stuck

575
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,840
for 10 hours at the airport with this

576
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,160
person could i sit with them and have a

577
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,480
coffee or a beer you know

578
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,919
because humans are pack animals and they

579
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,679
want to work with people they like

580
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,240
and i heard one saying in life too that

581
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,679
kind of helped make me think about this

582
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,000
was you know you only have to be liked

583
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,400
on time or on budget i mean you have to

584
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,160
be either liked on time or budget but

585
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,919
you really only need two of those at any

586
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,240
given time and the like capability can

587
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,400
go really far so if you can really kind

588
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,919
of bond with these people as you're

589
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,200
going through this process and make sure

590
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,960
it's the right cultural fit it's just

591
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,720
going to be a better process for you as

592
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,840
you go through it and ultimately when

593
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,679
you get that job

594
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:40,880
so as you go through the rest of the

595
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,880
process this hiring manager that you get

596
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,280
to kind of know and get a feel for it's

597
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,799
going to be a gatekeeper for much of the

598
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,120
process going forward they'll likely

599
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,960
have some recommendations and advice

600
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,880
with you as you interview

601
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,080
and you're going to want to know like is

602
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,840
it one two or five or even seven people

603
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,440
you're going to be interviewing with

604
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,320
and

605
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,000
if you know that kind of going into it

606
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,520
you have somebody that the hiring mayor

607
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,960
just got some confidence in you they

608
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,120
might say hey i want you to talk to doug

609
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,600
brush he's coming in um you're going to

610
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,200
build that confidence and camaraderie

611
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,000
with them it's only going to benefit you

612
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,360
so now that you've got your kind of

613
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,400
internal

614
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,720
intel gathered on on the company and

615
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,400
some of the people

616
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,840
want to work towards weaponization and

617
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,799
this is really when you kind of start

618
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,640
getting your stuff together

619
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,400
um one of the questions that comes up

620
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,919
quite quite a bit is you know should i

621
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,080
have a cover letter and record this

622
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,480
that's the easy answer yes just do it uh

623
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,240
please reach out to me to formats one of

624
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,600
the things i have to do in the next week

625
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,840
is kind of get together some resources

626
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,600
for this talk and put together in a blog

627
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,840
or a linkedin post on resources that i

628
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,080
compiled for and i'll cross post it on

629
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,400
the discord as well just you know a few

630
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,600
things i got to see over the next couple

631
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,360
days before i do it but like

632
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,679
cover letter templates things like that

633
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,840
um so you have some resources because

634
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,280
again going back to the coverage letters

635
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,640
if it's done right it can be very

636
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,320
effective and let someone know who you

637
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,039
are

638
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,880
beyond just your resume

639
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,440
and when you do make it out make it out

640
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,880
to that hiring manager who you've

641
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,559
already you know kind of recon and

642
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,000
figure out who it's going to be you make

643
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,840
sure it goes to that and that

644
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,480
it's attached with it is a very clean

645
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,960
resume it's in a clean format has a good

646
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,039
use of white space personally i like to

647
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,360
see non-serif fonts just little ocd

648
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,640
things about me because just looks

649
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,919
cleaner on the screen anything that

650
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,960
looks cleaner feels right um is better

651
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,559
and again less of the clutter that

652
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:25,919
you're looking at it honestly at this

653
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:26,960
point

654
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,200
you don't need to have your home address

655
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,760
um just your name email and phone number

656
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,760
bullet points in white space are just a

657
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,520
visual layout that helps the human brain

658
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,320
process data so less is more

659
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,039
when you put together your resume to

660
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,120
have an intro paragraph and a few

661
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,720
sentences and phrases about the type of

662
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,559
professional you are and most

663
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,280
importantly what you bring to the table

664
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,000
um because ultimately people don't read

665
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,760
the whole resume whether it's one page

666
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,760
two or three they're gonna skim they're

667
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,679
gonna start really heavy on the first

668
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,280
half of the first page

669
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,360
skim read quicker quicker quicker flip

670
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,960
through the last couple pages so

671
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,919
designed for that um

672
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,760
you want to know again what what what

673
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,520
the how the brain of the audience is

674

going to work out for you so by laying

675
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,320
it out by that it's going to help them

676
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,080
absorb information and again if you

677
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,760
emphasize where your strengths are up

678
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,600
front it's only going to help sit in

679
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,840
their mind further so that's where at

680
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,360
the top of the resume i like to really

681
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,600
pass the intro paragraph is then have

682
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,520
your recent jobs first and then your

683
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,600
search in education

684
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,520
i also like to see altruistic things as

685
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,799
a hiring manager you know what else

686
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,120
people are doing are they mentoring for

687
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,120
bluetooth village do they volunteer at

688
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,679
sands as a community teacher whatever it

689
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,360
is just keep it shortened to the point

690
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,799
but i like to see things about people

691
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,520
that are about the people

692
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,039
and again when you put through all these

693
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,720
things about what you're doing in the

694
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,440
job descriptions um and what your roles

695
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,559
have been don't just list things that

696
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,880
is an assumed job function

697
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,880
when it comes to present what you do i

698
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,039
want to know the impact of what you do

699
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,520
so if somebody says hey

700
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,280
i work with splunk enterprise security

701
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,600
is a tier one stock analyst

702
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,159
cool that's like the the basics for this

703
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:11,200
job why like who cares i expect that

704
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,840
somebody says i utilize splunk es daily

705
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,840
as a tier one analyst and developed ir

706
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,840
workflows to reduce mean time to resolve

707
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,280
issues from one day to two hours oh okay

708
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,440
now i i see this person had some impact

709
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,200
on their job they were able to really

710
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,520
put some meaning behind their days

711
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,360
so you get it you kind of quantify what

712
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,200
you do when you do it and how much you

713
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,360
do it um you know even in my own stuff

714
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,480
you know for it's gonna be different for

715
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,080
everybody but when i'm getting into

716
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,400
business development things i might say

717
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,960
um you know at special counsel i built a

718
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,320
data beach practice and grew the

719
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,159
practice from three people to 300 people

720
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,600
in 10 months with eight million dollars

721
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,640
in top line revenue as opposed to just

722
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,400
special counsel data breach practice you

723
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,480
know i want to put some some real impact

724
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,640
to what i've been able to do

725
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,960
here's a kind of an example resume i've

726
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,400
helped one of my buddies work on

727
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,159
recently so on the left is the old the

728
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,679
news on the right and you'll see there's

729
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,000
some subtle differences but it's geared

730
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
to stand out and again as somebody

731
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,280
skimming or flipping through these

732
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,400
things

733
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,679
the cleaner one's going to be a little

734
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,320
bit more impactful and so you have this

735
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,000
there's this impact and i know right

736
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,400
away where this person is but i have

737
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,600
additional questions i don't want to

738
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,039
know everything it shouldn't be boil the

739
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,880
ocean and it shouldn't be like what the

740
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,919
hell kind of questions like what the

741
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,120
hell are they talking about it's like

742
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,039
questions like wow this this candidate's

743
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,720
really done some progression throughout

744
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,039
their career with this organization i

745
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,200
want to know how they did it um get me

746
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,559
on the phone with that person and it's

747
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,000
that ideas like you're really trying to

748
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,559
get that first phone call

749
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,400
because again that's the first step

750
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,919
after this weaponization is like you get

751
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,840
your resume there to get a phone call

752
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,520
that's it it doesn't have to be a boil

753
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,720
the ocean educate somebody and

754
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,760
everything

755
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,080
um one of the things too is that i'll

756
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,600
notice is that as i'm looking at resumes

757
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,679
i'll cross-reference it with linkedin i

758
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,840
want to see if there's differences um

759
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,080
between the two you know sometimes if

760
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,880
it's

761
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,400
you know kind of

762
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,919
if it's missing things or words

763
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,120
different it might bring in a question

764
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,200
of who this is i want to trust but

765
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,720
to validate that what the person's

766
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,480
saying on their resume is true so i'll

767
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,039
cross reference and look for gaps in bs

768
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:11,840
um

769
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,760
and again subtle differences and subtle

770
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,440
details but if you on your linkedin you

771
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,440
can also go in and do basically a vanity

772
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,679
url for lack of a better word but you

773
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:20,880
know like mine's

774
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,360
you know linkedin

775
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,880
douglas a brush you know it's just

776
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,320
something easier and clean it doesn't

777
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,000
have all the extra letters and numbers

778
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,200
just has that nice little hey this

779
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,640
person put a little bit more attention

780
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,080
to things and how they're presenting

781
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,320
themselves professionally and this also

782
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,440
goes to

783
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,039
headshots

784
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,960
please for the love of god

785
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,039
get a professional headshot um there are

786
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,559
a ton of freelance photographers out

787
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,960
there now you can get headshots done and

788
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,600
edited for you at a very low cost

789
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,440
just enough with the selfies cropped

790
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,760
photos from wear weddings

791
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,840
blurry shots that look like bad mug

792
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,520
shots those are just unprofessional and

793
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,799
they don't look good again you're trying

794
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,559
to stand out

795
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,240
you want to look your best first

796
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,520

00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,400
the best that you can

800
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,120
also when you go through this and you're

801
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,880
putting together your

802
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,480
requisition when you're looking at the

803
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,080
different requisitions

804
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,760
and you're building your your package

805
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,120
that you're going to send out to this

806
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,039
you know this weaponization of this

807
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,520
awesome resume cv cover letter malware

808
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,679
whatever that package is going to be

809
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,840
design it for each audience and so

810
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,679
personalize it so if it's you know

811
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,840
you're applying for a similar maybe sock

812
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,000
analyst job across multiple

813
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,919
organizations don't just copy and paste

814
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,520
you know look again like i said go back

815
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,720
to some of the other stuff i said how

816
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,480
they're using language and wording and

817
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,919
make sure that it is being very

818
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,159
personalized for that particular

819
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,400
requisition that you're applying for so

820
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,520
you might find that there's certain

821
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,679
keywords in the wreck and you use them

822
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,520
where it's honest and appropriate so

823
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,520
again they might use certain things like

824
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,520
uh you know analyst junior analysts

825
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,520
different phraseology that's going to be

826
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,799
important for you to get through this

827
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,159
process because it's going to connect

828
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,480
more with you matching what's actual

829
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,559
there again don't

830
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,240
make up stuff like don't copy and paste

831
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,760
things that you can't do that or on the

832
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,679
job rack but if it aligns with what your

833
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,919
your capabilities and skills are by all

834
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,120
means use that language um and because a

835
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,960
lot of this too is going to be analytics

836
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,840
from an seo type perspective um and you

837
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,400
want to relate it to your history

838
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,159
because there's also one thing to talk

839
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:25,760
about is big applicant tracking systems

840
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,960
are basically going to keyword a lot of

841
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,480
this so sometimes you want those things

842
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,880
to be exact matches but we'll get to

843
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,200
that a little bit later and again your

844
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,960
the goal of all this is just to get that

845
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,120
first phone call at this stage um so

846
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,720
keep framing it like that don't boil the

847
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,720
ocean make sure your this crafty little

848
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,279
malware is designed to do what it does

849
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,880
um one of the other things too is is you

850
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,919
know kind of measure twice cut once is

851
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,200
run it through grammarly and i know a

852
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,320
bunch of people are kind of plural

853
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,679
clutching right now about grammarly and

854
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,120
data privacy fine don't use it but at

855
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,960
least have somebody else look at it edit

856
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,080
it for you

857
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,679
you really want to make sure things are

858
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,480
super clean and on point totally on

859
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,240
fleek before you submit it because

860
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,159
nothing pisses me off more as a hiring

861
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,440
manager is just sloppy misspellings just

862
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,039
indicates laziness

863
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,039
i don't want to see that you know again

864
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,559
if somebody's really not into this

865
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,000
process i'm not going to bother talking

866
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,279
to them

867
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,279
so make sure that it's it's clean and

868
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,960
it's accurate and when it's getting to

869
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,200
that that that hiring manager finally

870
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,640
above all again be honest do not

871
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,320
beef up things that you can't do if

872
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,399
you've only had experience with certain

873
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,559
forensic tools like i've had people you

874
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,159
know done mock interviews where somebody

875
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:33,279
said

876
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,039
i was like you know can you have you use

877
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,840
x-rays on case or ftk yes to what depth

878
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,200
oh yeah use them and i'll be like i'll

879
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,960
ask them a basic question like well okay

880
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,960
texas i really didn't use it but it was

881
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,880
on it was you know we spent an hour with

882
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,240
it in school i'm like okay don't ever

883
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,240
say that you've actually used it then

884
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,919
you know unless you've really used it

885
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,600
don't don't lie i'm going to pick that

886
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,080
up and ask follow-up questions

887
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,320
let's move on to delivery

888
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,440
now we're going to ready to fire right

889
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,720
so make sure you're applying to the

890
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,960
right person into the right job wreck at

891
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,080
this point you know again you're being

892
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,960
very selective as you're sensing this

893
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,559
and the reason being is that applicant

894
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,159
tracking systems are notoriously

895
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,760
unfriending um they can be very easy to

896
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,640
submit to the wrong job number even for

897
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,200
an identical role in a different region

898
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,200
with a different hiring manager so you

899
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,559
want to make sure that the job that

900
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,000
you're linking to and if it brings you

901
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,679
through multiple links it's back to

902
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:26,960
where you originally found it if again

903
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,960
if it was somebody referring you say hey

904
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,480
we have this open job wreck again make

905
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,760
sure that you're replying to the right

906
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,679
job it's a very

907
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:34,960
simple thing to say but it's an easy

908
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,320
mistake to make um so just be very wary

909
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,919
of that as you go through that and again

910
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,760
the more that you can personalize things

911
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,039
the better

912
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,320
as you're putting things into these

913
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,640
systems you know make it you know kind

914
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,159
of uh

915
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,760
about you again you know you've built

916
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,200
some of this stuff off your prior work

917
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,880
so it should just should flow very

918
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,799
naturally to this point but as you're

919
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,399
getting into applying to these different

920
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,720
systems as well have multiple formats

921
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,720
ready in advance you want to have your

922
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,720
word version your text version your pdf

923
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,240
version you know maybe your linkedin

924
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,440
stuff's already getting cleaned up

925
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,279
because you've mastered with your resume

926
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,960
because some of these sites can time out

927
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,559
as you're trying to convert your cover

928
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,720
letter to a word doc in a text and then

929
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,080
you have to start all over again this is

930
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,919
similar if any of you've done you know

931
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:17,360
call for papers i've seen this is like

932
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,880
crap i have it in a word doc and then

933
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,480
things don't copy and paste and it times

934
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,360
out so

935
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,960
have things in these multiple formats so

936
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,799
you can very easily move it into the

937
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,960
system check it and qc it before it

938
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,480
times out um

939
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,760
because if you have to start all over

940
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,120
again and keep putting in you're likely

941
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,480
to make a mistake and again that's only

942
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,080
going to hurt your job

943
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,440
um you're getting a job chances so again

944
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,799
just having looks like you would with

945
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,399
with malware you have multiple versions

946
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,399
of your payload in your attack kit so

947
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:43,520
you just want to get that initial

948
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,360
foothold and while you're doing this

949
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,600
technology will fail so be

950
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,279
prepared

951
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:50,480
one of the things i mentioned shoes

952
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,480
about these applicant tracking systems

953
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,440
is that they will ingest this data that

954
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,960
you put in their data analytic systems

955
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,240
and they're going to do keyword searches

956
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,760
and look for different things

957
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,360
um

958
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,600
so i've had issues with folks say this

959
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,520
before where certain things like

960
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,720
ci cisp is might be treated differently

961
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,880
than c dot i

962
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,720
dot s dot s

963
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,120
dot p

964
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,399
dot

965
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,320
so you know punctuation can sometimes

966
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,679
show these things off and i had somebody

967
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,919
say to me was like well yeah they passed

968
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:23,279
me over for

969
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,039
this requisition because i said i didn't

970
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,840
have a cis like you don't have a csp no

971
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,799
i did

972
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:29,919
it's just that when the applicant

973
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:31,520
tracking system went through it i had

974
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,279
periods in it and it ignored my resume

975
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,880
and i never got the job i was like holy

976
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,720
crap so again i think somebody thinking

977
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,919
about these things

978
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,440
and you know the computer might say

979
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,760
you're not qualified so be prepared for

980
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,799
things like that just because the

981
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,559
computer says no you have to be ready to

982
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,080
have again those multiple formats look

983
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,159
again how it's set up in the ingest

984
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,000
system when you're putting the job uh

985
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,360
putting into the applicant tracking

986
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,840
system if it's asking for those be very

987
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,840
careful little nuances like that because

988
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,720
it could break some of the process

989
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,480
on to intrusions okay so now you're

990
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,240
likely gonna get your first interview

991
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,320
it's probably gonna be somebody in hr

992
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,679
like you'll send something to the hiring

993
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:06,720
manager

994
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,399
it's been really personalized wow this

995
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:09,840
is a great candidate sends it to the

996
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,600
hiring manager who's going to then i'm

997
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,279
sorry the internal recruiter who's

998
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,039
likely going to want to call you and

999
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,720
they're going to screen you and decide

1000
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,240
with the hiring manager if you move

1001
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,080
forward after that stage

1002
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,279
um and so you screen with the

1003
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,440
uh internal recruiter who then says i'm

1004
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,559
going to set up a call with the hiring

1005
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:27,840
manager next

1006
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,159
so at that point when you start speaking

1007
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:31,600
to the hiring manager they will be the

1008
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,679
first to ask a ton of questions this is

1009
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,760
where you want to get a lot of internal

1010
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,159
recon done you're in the environment now

1011
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:39,600
you have

1012
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,120
something and someone you can leverage

1013
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,880
to get as much information

1014
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,320
and you're also going to ask you know

1015
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,559
how does this organization do the hiring

1016
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,799
you should not be surprised going

1017
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:49,919
forward you're going to want to know

1018
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,360
what the schedule is like who it's going

1019
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,039
to be with is it going to be remote is

1020
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,799
it going to be in person which are the

1021
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,480
interviews or tech interviews which are

1022
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,799
cultural interviews so ask a ton of

1023
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,159
questions so you're just you should not

1024
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:02,159
be surprised going forward

1025
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,840
also one of the things i also recommend

1026
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,679
too is as you're bouncing between the

1027
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,120
hiring manager

1028
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,039
and the internal recruiter is have the

1029
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,960
recruiter's contact information cell

1030
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,120
phone email it's very likely if you go

1031
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,600
to something like a job fight or a hub

1032
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,200
for these applicant tracking systems

1033
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,960
it's like a portal it's great it'll it

1034
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,640
reduces some of the noise and mistakes

1035
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,000
but it also increases some of the

1036
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,760
mistakes too because

1037
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,000
what can happen is say

1038
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,039
you submit it and you're communicating

1039
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,880
back and forth through um you're

1040
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,399
submitting messages back and forth to

1041
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,960
this tracking system and it kept it it

1042
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,000
doesn't get through and i had this

1043
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,519
happen with a friend of mine recently

1044
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:38,880
can i say hey do you ever hear back from

1045
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,559
that recruiter no no the internal

1046
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:41,679
recruiters told is totally ghosting me

1047
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,760
man i was like doesn't seem right like i

1048
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,120
know that organ well enough somebody

1049
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,880
should have reached out to you finally

1050
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,640
pushed him to call the recruiter

1051
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,240
incidentally he didn't get the job for

1052
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,679
to get the job but the recruiter's like

1053
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,600
no we let you know like we sent you

1054
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,519
messages and what had been happening was

1055
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,519
all the stuff went to his spam folder

1056
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,360
because what was happening is the

1057
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,960
recruiter was sending the messages

1058
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,720
through the applicant tracking system

1059
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,000
and due to the fact that many of these

1060
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,720
systems will send on behalf of a domain

1061
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,799
so it'll be like jobvite sitting on

1062
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,960
behalf of douglasbrush.com

1063
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,960
so if you depending how spam filters are

1064
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,880
set up the return path being different

1065
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,039
than the domain that's sending flags for

1066
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,640
spam and can go right into those filters

1067
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,960
and it happens all the time so be wary

1068
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,080
be proactive and again get this get the

1069
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,600
recruiters contact information if you

1070
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,519
don't hear back them for the day gently

1071
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,600
nudge them and email or text because

1072
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,600
they also want to show that if you're

1073
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,039
if you want this job you're showing some

1074
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:34,960
interest and again if you're on the line

1075
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,840
maybe that little bit of extra you know

1076
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,159
drive will help you get it so again just

1077
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,000
again it's a communications thing at

1078
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,360
this at this point to make sure you're

1079
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,960
on top of it that's the real key

1080
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,440
takeaway

1081
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,799
once you're going to get in

1082
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:49,760
uh you're going to want to kind of

1083
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,919
continue some of this process and take

1084
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:53,679
the cues from the prior steps of recon

1085
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:55,519
and building a buyer profile because

1086
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:57,120
you're going to be talking to a lot of

1087
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,720
different people throughout this process

1088
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,039
and no two people are the same so as you

1089
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,880
get to talk to each p each different

1090
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,480
person throughout the interviewing

1091
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,080
process it could be four different

1092
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,200
interviewers you want to know a little

1093
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,560
bit about them so

1094
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,918
again helping a friend of mine with this

1095
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:11,599
recently and he's like

1096
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,040
uh they're gonna give me four interviews

1097
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,359
i was like go cyber stalk them he's very

1098
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:17,918
technical person he's like well why why

1099
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:20,079
would i do that um well i was like you

1100
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:21,520
don't want to go into talking to each

1101
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,359
person blind you want to have a feel for

1102
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:24,719
them get some of their personalities

1103
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:25,839
their likes

1104
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:27,199
and he's like a little bit hesitant but

1105
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,960
he did sure enough he calls back an hour

1106
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,879
later he's like holy crap you know we're

1107
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:32,960
out here in colorado so shocker some of

1108
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,399
the people he's interviewing with like

1109
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,320
outdoor stuff split boarding and craft

1110
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,639
beer but he's like oh cool like i i

1111
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,839
would have never thought to even look at

1112
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,280
this stuff now i know a little bit about

1113
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,079
them

1114
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,760
and sure enough when he went into the

1115
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,399
interview they got to talking about that

1116
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:47,839
he calls me after he's like wow i really

1117
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:49,599
connected with that person we spent more

1118
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:51,520
time talking about you know

1119
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,440
back country snowboarding and beers than

1120
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,800
we did with the actual job and i was

1121
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,239
like well that's good like you really

1122
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,640
connected with that person as a person

1123
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,480
that's a good thing and that's only

1124
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,000
going to help you to go through this job

1125
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,400
process uh because it's it's what it is

1126
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,480
it's social engineering i'm sorry and to

1127
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,640
get the best job and be in the best

1128
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,400
position ever to get the job you have to

1129
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,000
be stand out from other people you have

1130
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,359
to

1131
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:15,839
be you and they want to hire you so i

1132
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:17,359
hire for that person and i want to see

1133
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:18,800
who that person is and if it doesn't

1134
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,680
really

1135
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,280
feel right i'm probably going to pass

1136
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,880
them over because ultimately i can teach

1137
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,800
tech skills i can teach all the ir

1138
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,200
process yada yada i can't teach someone

1139
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,960
not to being an after i've

1140
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,320
already hired them or really i don't

1141
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,240
want to i hate to have to adult for

1142
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,440
other people

1143
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,440
um so again you know i want to make sure

1144
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,040
that this is a good cultural fit and you

1145
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,240
want to stand out too and make sure

1146
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,079
you're feeling it's right

1147
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,400
it should already kind of as you're

1148
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,440
starting to go through this as far as

1149
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,880
starting to feel more natural too as

1150
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,079
you're talking these people it's kind of

1151
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,920
like living off the land you know you're

1152
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,280
slowly kind of working your way

1153
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,640
throughout the organization and

1154
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,480
connecting with people but you want it

1155
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,079
to already feel so natural that you're

1156
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,839
already part of the organization and

1157
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:57,839
that i'm kind of blending in so think

1158
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,160
about that in that process too and to do

1159
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,680
that and get ready for that do mock

1160
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,359
interviews with people friends family

1161
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:04,800
your dog yourself look in the mirror i

1162
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,960
don't care but you know have some

1163
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,720
questions prepared to answer and

1164
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,320
rehearse them so you feel comfortable

1165
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,040
and relaxed um you know you want to be

1166
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,880
able to just not hear something the

1167
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,320
first time be scrambling to answer it

1168
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,760
should almost come off your tongue a

1169
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,599
little bit it shouldn't be robotic or

1170
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:20,960
mechanical but

1171
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,079
you should have at least thought through

1172
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,000
some of these questions a couple times

1173
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,280
and certainly if you don't if you're

1174
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,440
asked something and you don't know it

1175
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,960
don't freeze like deer in the headlights

1176
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,040
and lie the expectation is not for you

1177
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,480
to know everything and personally when

1178
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,040
i'm hiring somebody i ask questions that

1179
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,040
they should be challenged to answer at

1180
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,560
the level i'm bringing them in for to

1181
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,560
see how they react and if they say

1182
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,079
something to me like you know to be

1183
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:44,079
honest i've never come across that it's

1184
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,760
much better than any of the bs you're

1185
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,359
going to try to make up on the spot

1186
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:48,800
because that will detect that in under a

1187
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,160
second and so will any other hiring

1188
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,560
manager so just be honest it's it's fine

1189
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,280
people like honesty trust me

1190
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,640
and some of the things that people say

1191
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,560
too is like well what questions should i

1192
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,320
ask i'm like absolutely great question i

1193
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,760
want to see that too i want to show that

1194
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,960
somebody shows some interest that

1195
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,160
they're not just

1196
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,760
flicking out resumes left and right

1197
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,040
trying to get a job because they're just

1198
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,240
passively doing it i want to make sure

1199
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,160
this is an engaged person so come

1200
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,079
prepared to ask questions ask about the

1201
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,880
culture ask what the person who you're

1202
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,000
you're interviewing with what their

1203
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,320
day-to-day life is like or how much of

1204
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,839
it is spent in meetings how much is it

1205
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,280
spent doing this how much has it spent

1206
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,119
doing that have them break it down

1207
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:24,960
because i recently had another friend go

1208
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,160
through the process

1209
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,599
and unfortunately they probably didn't

1210
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,040
coach him enough on this but he got into

1211
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,720
this job in the last two weeks he's like

1212
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,240
yeah they have way too many meetings for

1213
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,920
my taste i don't think this i really

1214
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,760
don't like that they do that as much my

1215
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,680
last job we had maybe one meeting a day

1216
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,200
so if to him it's like he didn't know

1217
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,320
what the day to day was going to look

1218
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,599
like and he kind of walked in once he

1219
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,359
got the job surprised you should never

1220
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:45,599
be again no surprises at this

1221
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:46,800
um

1222
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,000
one of the questions that i also like to

1223
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,240
ask people is like say hey you know why

1224
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,520
are you here you know why are you at

1225
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,280
splunk um

1226
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,040
what gets you up to go to work every day

1227
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,240
i want to know that the people that i'm

1228
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,520
interviewing with are driven that i'm

1229
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,560
going to be working with people that

1230
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,079
have you know similar likes and feelings

1231
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,079
but again that they're they're happy at

1232
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,119
their job and i'm going to be able to

1233
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:04,560
detect that so

1234
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,400
feel free to ask some questions that and

1235
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,839
certainly ask some challenging questions

1236
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:09,200
one of the things i like to ask people

1237
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,119
when i'm interviewing is saying

1238
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,800
um if you can change anything at this

1239
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,440
organization what would it be and why

1240
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,119
and it makes them kind of think saying

1241
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:18,960
look things are not perfect but you know

1242
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,960
i wish this was something that we can

1243
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,920
change

1244
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,880
um

1245
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,480
and we're really working towards it you

1246
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,079
know and it's it just shows that they're

1247
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:27,440
kind of engaging with them on a human

1248
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,000
level and it's a again a huge huge thing

1249
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,839
and it's really nice icing on the cake

1250
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:35,680
um after you've

1251
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,520
kind of launched this you've gotten in

1252
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,720
you've talked to a bunch of people and

1253
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,480
again this is gonna this is this action

1254
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,760
objective thing should be an iterative

1255
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,680
part after each stage

1256
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,560
um

1257
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,800
is to send

1258
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,880
and i if i can send taylor thank you

1259
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,960
notes to each person i interviewed with

1260
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,040
and reference things from the notes on

1261
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,960
that conversation don't just copy and

1262
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,040
paste it was a pleasure speaking you to

1263
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,359
today blah blah this will generally be

1264
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:00,800
forwarded throughout the organization

1265
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,400
and laughed at if everybody gets the

1266
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,480
same thank you note so spend some time

1267
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,160
making this bespoke thank you note for

1268
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,240
each individual referencing things that

1269
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,440
you talked about again i want to see

1270
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,560
this as a human being behind this um and

1271
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,839
it tells a different story right it

1272
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:16,000
tells then you know that this person

1273
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,440
really thought about the conversation

1274
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,040
that i had

1275
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,640
it shows them i'm professional quite

1276
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,720
frankly i mean ultimately it's a nice

1277
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,480
touch it's just a super

1278
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,920
nice thing to do and i've had people

1279
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,200
that i've interviewed send me

1280
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,800
handwritten thank you notes those are

1281
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,800
people that i hired as interns and are

1282
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,680
now

1283
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,560
you know

1284
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,200
senior managers at organizations because

1285
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,040
it's like this person really showed

1286
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,880
some level of professionalism they stood

1287
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,760
out and that's again was the key

1288
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,880
because ultimately as you go through

1289
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,800
this process you want to be all in to

1290
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,240
not just throw against the wall and

1291
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,920
hope it sticks across multiple

1292
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,160
organizations with multiple people

1293
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,920
it's just it's just spammy and

1294
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,280
unprofessional so really make sure

1295
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,720
you're going to talk to each person it's

1296
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,880
about them again your social engineering

1297
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,240
you really want to get get in with this

1298
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,680
person and you're thanking them and

1299
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,760
thanking them make it about them and how

1300
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,319
this process is about about it because

1301
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:05,920
ultimately you really want to have this

1302
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,520
confidence that you're just getting

1303
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,640
going through this process and you

1304
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,640
respect everybody and you're being

1305
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,160
confident throughout the whole thing so

1306
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,079
use confident language

1307
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,000
i look forward to the next steps with

1308
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,680
this opportunity in meeting the rest of

1309
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,720
the team

1310
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,880
not something like i hope to hear from

1311
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,000
you soon hope nope i will talk to you

1312
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,480
soon i look forward to it like it's it's

1313
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,240
an assumed thought so none of the

1314
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,880
wishy-washy bs if you want this job get

1315
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,599
it go all in own it

1316
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,040
already assume you have this job and

1317
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,960
you're just going through the motions

1318
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,319
confidence at this stage as you're

1319
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:40,000
talking to people is so very important

1320
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,839
to complete your objectives

1321
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,520
and if you don't have somebody's contact

1322
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,880
information to send them a thank you

1323
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,640
note there is something you can do is

1324
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,160
reach out to that hiring manager because

1325
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,240
again you've gotten at least a contact

1326
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:50,839
with

1327
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:52,960
them and you're going to say something

1328
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,400
like this and say hey look i just want

1329
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,160
to follow up with the next steps

1330
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,040
um with so and so i you know the the i

1331
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,480
don't have their contact information

1332
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,920
because it came through job right or

1333
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,920
some applicant tracking system

1334
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,200
but i do want to send a thank you note

1335
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,960
to everybody would you be comfortable

1336
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,400
sharing these people's individuals if

1337
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,920
not if i send you a thank you note will

1338
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,000
you forward it on again

1339
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,960
you're now

1340
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,720
also showing other stuff to the hiring i

1341
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,160
mean to the recruiter that's probably

1342
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,599
going to go to the hiring manager this

1343
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:19,280
person's taking the extra steps to be

1344
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,359
super professional and really say thank

1345
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,119
you um so it's really going to be one of

1346
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:24,400
those things to help you stand out and

1347
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,680
even if that person doesn't necessarily

1348
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,680
get that thank you note that this the

1349
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,280
attempt will be felt within that

1350
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,880
organization

1351
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,800
um so so that's that now

1352
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,640
let's assume they're about to give you

1353
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,319
that job offer you did it

1354
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:41,839
you've gotten in this organization you

1355
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:43,599
moved laterally

1356
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:45,839
keys of the kingdom

1357
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:46,880
what are you gonna do about comp

1358
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,880
negotiation now

1359
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,079
this has changed since i started even

1360
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:51,040
put this together since the beginning of

1361
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,240
the years

1362
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,440
typically what i also tell people to do

1363
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,640
is you're going through this process is

1364
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,560
punt it to the end you know things like

1365
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,920
if they say hey you know what are you

1366
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,680
looking for say i i

1367
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,760
definitely want to um

1368
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,280
you know talk about the finances this

1369
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,480
but first i just want to understand the

1370
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,520
cultural fit the roles and

1371
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,200
responsibilities i want to see if this

1372
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,160
is a better

1373
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,599
fit before we start talking about salary

1374
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,119
it's just a good general negotiation

1375
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:16,400
things in business is to push those

1376
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,599
things to the end and keep the

1377
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:19,119
conversation going because you want to

1378
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,200
draw people in to to get more confidence

1379
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,119
and give you more of what you want

1380
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:26,960
now confidence to all this is is um in

1381
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,640
several states including the state of

1382
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,800
colorado where i am now california and

1383
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,400
others you can't ask

1384
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,680
uh

1385
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,880
pointedly

1386
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,440
uh you know hey what somebody makes um

1387
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,520
and they have to post some of the pay

1388
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,920
bans the reason being is that

1389
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,000
it's an extremely discriminatory

1390
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,440
discriminatory practice that's been

1391
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,359
going on for far too long that i hope

1392
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:48,800
ends and that's part of my other talks i

1393
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,480
do a ton of talks on diversity equity

1394
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,280
inclusion neurodiversity

1395
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,680
but the fact of the matter is is

1396
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,000
women and people of color are paid far

1397
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,920
less than fall white dudes that look

1398
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,359
like me that's just the reality and a

1399
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:03,680
lot of it is because of it's not that oh

1400
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,200
they're not going out there and pushing

1401
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,599
for it that's bs the reality is is that

1402
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:10,079
people are historically paid lower um in

1403
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:11,040
those

1404
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,119
within those underrepresented groups and

1405
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:15,119
when they say well i'm you know i get

1406
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:17,119
paid this no

1407
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,319
hiring manager is like yeah i'm going to

1408
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:19,599
give them a 20

1409
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:21,280
uplift just to match with the parity of

1410
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,359
other people i wish more companies were

1411
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:24,720
altruistic like that the reality it's

1412
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,040
not so they're removing more of those

1413
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,040
current salary questions which is great

1414
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,200
so it's going to allow more parity of

1415
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,520
pay through all individuals so certainly

1416
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,680
support that if you can within your

1417
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,280
state organizations things like that

1418
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,520
that's my little sidebar on that but

1419
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,119
again if somebody if you're not one of

1420
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,400
the states and somebody says hey what's

1421
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,839
your current you don't have to answer

1422
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:45,599
that you just know you do not have to

1423
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,240
play your cards at this point and let

1424
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,839
them leverage that against you at any

1425
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:51,680
point because again this is this is

1426
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,520
business it's not friends as much as

1427
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,640
you're building that friendly

1428
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,760
relationship

1429
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,359
um because you've also done your

1430
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:58,800
research you know what the pay bans are

1431
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,480
going to be for a job like this you can

1432
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,240
go to things like linkedin

1433
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,200
um

1434
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,200
i wish i did more research 10 minutes

1435
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,800
ago when i was thinking about this but

1436
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,240
it was linkedin glassdoor and a couple

1437
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,680
others that'll show you what are out

1438
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,400
there

1439
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,319
additionally there's salary surveys you

1440
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:13,440
know you can look for things like that

1441
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,960
like salary surveys that are put up with

1442
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,200
particular organizations uh colorado

1443
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,200
equal security has a security one that's

1444
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,560
out there you can go to the colorado

1445
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,480
security slack and look for it

1446
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,079
ping me there if you need connections to

1447
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,480
do that i can help um

1448
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,240
but you should you should have done your

1449
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,760
research far beyond this point to know

1450
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,760
what it is so it's never a surprise

1451
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,280
and you know what you want to do is

1452
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,560
ultimately look at the total comp you

1453
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,640
know the dollar value as you get older

1454
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,280
matters less i have

1455
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,920
a family now so you know 20 30 years ago

1456
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,680
maybe salary that's all all i wanted and

1457
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,119
i was just going to work and play in new

1458
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,119
york city so i didn't care

1459
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:48,560
whatever vacation they gave me because i

1460
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,240
was just going to go out on the weekends

1461
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,920
vacation didn't matter i just wanted

1462
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,400
money now that is completely different

1463
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,280
being 45 with a family you know i want i

1464
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,599
want good health care i want low co-pays

1465
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,359
in my health care i want to make sure

1466
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:04,079
that i have orthodontist service for my

1467
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:05,280
10 year old you know it's things like

1468
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,640
that that i have to look at look at

1469
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,040
these total comps to understand what

1470
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,319
everything's going to be involved just

1471
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:11,520
the dollars are they going to be

1472
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,240
offering you rsu's stock options nor are

1473
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,599
these things that are going to play out

1474
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:17,520
that if you maybe you hold back on some

1475
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,359
of the salary at the time it's gonna

1476
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:21,040
have a bigger payout later look at this

1477
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,839
in its totality as you get to know what

1478
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,359
you're doing and some of these might be

1479
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:27,520
creating pawns maybe you don't care

1480
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,680
about unlimited pto maybe it's like

1481
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,640
they're saying hey we're gonna give you

1482
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,119
five weeks of pto and you don't care ask

1483
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:34,640
for more money and when they say well we

1484
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,400
have to negotiate say fine i'll take off

1485
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,319
three weeks of the pto whatever it is

1486
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,319
like put some cons on the board that you

1487
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:42,560
can lose that don't matter as part of

1488
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,400
your total comp and then negotiate for

1489
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,599
the things that you do care about not

1490
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,960
how to work the opposite way or people

1491
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,440
like you can't pay me enough to work uh

1492
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,960
as much as you're asking if you can if

1493
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,960
we can find a balance i would like some

1494
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,480
more vacation time and i'm willing to

1495
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,119
lose some of my salary for that okay

1496
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,560
we can do that you know good i'm going

1497
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:59,680
to want to make sure i'm giving that

1498
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,000
person what they want

1499
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,760
so you know that's you know kind of the

1500
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,440
cops negotiation speech on that so

1501
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,720
really good

1502
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,240
advocate for yourself nobody else is

1503
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,720
going to go for what you want and

1504
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,240
play your cards close to your chest or

1505
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,240
the really big takeaways

1506
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,680
now what if you didn't get that job

1507
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,599
there's probably a reason out there get

1508
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:19,920
feedback ask you know reach out to these

1509
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,160
people and say look hey um

1510
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,839
i just i really appreciate the

1511
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:25,119
opportunity again you're super

1512
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:26,880
professional thankful just curious can

1513
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,640
give me some feedback on on my

1514
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,400
interviews uh you know what some of the

1515
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,200
the

1516
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,960
folks i interviewed with had to say i'd

1517
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,480
really like to know you know where i

1518
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,079
could have improved it's actually a

1519
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:38,960
really nice thing now some some works

1520
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,800
probably i'll say it's about 50 50 you

1521
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,480
know maybe more will will actually give

1522
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,440
it to you but there's going to be a lot

1523
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,040
that don't so don't don't get upset

1524
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,480
about that because ultimately you're

1525
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,400
creating a learning opportunity

1526
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,160
and you want to know what you can do

1527
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,920
better but also what can happen is you

1528
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,440
reach out to this organization i've

1529
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,280
actually just i gave this talk a couple

1530
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,960
days ago at

1531
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,319
rocky mount information security

1532
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,640
conference somebody posted like i had

1533
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,480
that exact thing happen i didn't get

1534
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,240
that wreck but when i reached out to say

1535
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,599
thank you what i couldn't better they

1536
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:07,119
said you know what actually we have

1537
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:08,880
another job wreck that's very similar

1538
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,240
would you like to apply for that one

1539
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,000
you're already in the system

1540
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,480
person says yes got that job so there's

1541
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,720
no reason not to go back at the go back

1542
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,920
at them and say hey look i really

1543
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,119
appreciate this thank you what could be

1544
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:21,040
better is there another job wreck ask

1545
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,640
them there might be something else out

1546
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,000
there

1547
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,839
and again once the recruiters already

1548
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:27,920
spent that time or hiring manager

1549
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,359
they're not going to want to start all

1550
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:31,040
the way back at ground zero so if you're

1551
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,480
already in there you're going to have an

1552
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,200
advantage up uh so so certainly ask for

1553
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,440
those types of things

1554
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,880
and ultimately ask yourself you know was

1555
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,319
this a job i really want was this my

1556
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:42,640
backup school so to speak where you know

1557
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,480
you've gone through this process

1558
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,559
but it was more of a hey i've got a

1559
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:48,640
couple of these if i get this job great

1560
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,119
but take it as a serious thing but

1561
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:52,720
practice you know the more that you get

1562
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,480
out there talk about yourself talk about

1563
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,480
your history and you're not just reading

1564
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,079
word for word off your resume as i'm

1565
00:47:58,079 --> 00:47:59,760
talking to you about what your history

1566
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,599
is the more comfortable it feels the

1567
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:03,920
better your job opportunities are so get

1568
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,599
out there and maybe apply for some of

1569
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:07,280
those backup jobs just even get in the

1570
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,480
door and go through the interview

1571
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,480
process so when the job you really want

1572
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,720
to get you're not going in cold

1573
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,160
like you haven't done this ten years you

1574
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,839
know you want to be on the top of your

1575
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:17,040
game

1576
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,240
so

1577
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,920
i greatly again appreciate all taking

1578
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,480
time with me today i hope there's a lot

1579
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,319
that we can do to change the industry

1580
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,559
once particularly when it comes to

1581
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:28,960
hiring practices you know it sucks that

1582
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,559
we have to build this hacking machine to

1583
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:32,480
make us get to the jobs we want because

1584
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,920
ultimately the system's broken um it's

1585
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,839
discriminatory it doesn't align people

1586
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:40,240
with the right skills um

1587
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,440
we've taken a lot of things out of

1588
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,760
corporate america to get jobs and put it

1589
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,040
in cyber security that needs to be

1590
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,880
changed but until then you know get in

1591
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,319
and make those changes from within so if

1592
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:50,559
you do get that job advocate for things

1593
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:52,319
like diversity equity and inclusion

1594
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:53,760
within your company

1595
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,440
try to change the hiring practice talk

1596
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,960
to people about how it can be fixed if

1597
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,720
you see that it's broken because you

1598
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,640
can't just get in and say thank god i

1599
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,800
did it that's like fix it okay you know

1600
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,480
we all have to work together

1601
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,880
um twitter linkedin i have a podcast

1602
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,720
cyber security interviews

1603
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,160
feel free to reach out to that actually

1604
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,280
right now i'm doing a lot of up and

1605
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,160
coming folks in the industry um so you

1606
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,359
can hear some of their stories that

1607
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:16,880
might be a little bit newer than

1608
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,880
somebody called me a grizzled old punk

1609
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,559
and she was a clear friend of mine so i

1610
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:22,800
guess i take that as a as a compliment

1611
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,559
but you know

1612
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:26,079
listen to other people's stories find

1613
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:28,319
out what works for them do your research

1614
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,920
um and connect with people in the

1615
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:30,960
community

1616
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,880
um we're all in this together we can all

1617
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,559
help each other through but you know

1618
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:36,400
you're not alone in your job searches

1619
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,319
you're not alone and finding information

1620
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:40,240
this is why we do these things and the

1621
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,440
thing is if you do start getting these

1622
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,800
jobs and you start getting in the

1623
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,160
industry you got to come back and do

1624
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,000
these things at circle citycon next year

1625
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,240
the year after wherever wild west

1626
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,559
hacking fest all the other cons get out

1627
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:52,800
there contribute give back so if you get

1628
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,280
something out of this my ask is

1629
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:56,559
you know we'll have a beer together at a

1630
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:58,160
conference soon but you are going to go

1631
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,760
out and do something for the community

1632
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,839
as well
