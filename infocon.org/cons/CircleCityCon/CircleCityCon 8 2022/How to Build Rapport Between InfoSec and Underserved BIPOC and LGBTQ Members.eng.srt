20
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,798

21
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,439

23
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,920
quietest room i have available and of

24
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,119
course

25
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,720
i have chickens in the backyard and they

26
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,560
just started making a massive ruckus and

27
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,400
i'm like

28
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,000
i wasn't sure if my mic would pick that

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,159
up

30
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,400
okay

31
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,360
sorry

32
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,720
how do you have

33
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,960
i have chickens how many how many do you

34
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,079
have oh

35
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,320
eight

36
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,079
it's kind of like a cooperative chicken

37
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,479
thing with two neighbors behind me we

38
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,520
all share the eggs so um

39
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,520
it's a lot of chickens for one backyard

40
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,320
but i had room for a big run

41
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,200
so

42
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,320
it's just

43
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,000
it was down to the lawn company would

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,079
show up to mo i'm sure while we do this

45
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,800
so

46
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,119

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,640
okay that works better

49
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,519
zoom always forgets my microphone

50
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,519

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,399
would like to go next introduce

70
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,880
themselves

71
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,358
hello i'm catherine robinson with

72
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,479
indiana

73
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,720
university health as well

74
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,440
and change management

75
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,160
and i am jackie davis also from iu

76
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,960
health and i do all things process

77
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,560
improvement

78
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,639
and today our presentation is going to

79
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,080
be on building rapport and a little bit

80
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,199
of background this is not your

81
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,720
traditional information security

82
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,560
presentation

83
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,000
so

84
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,520
big part of what we do in our

85
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,520
organization is we always try and look

86
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,280
for better ways for our information

87
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,080
security team to reach out to our

88
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,199
customers

89
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,800
and to get better response because

90
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,639
ultimately the vast number of attacks

91
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,400
that organizations see

92
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,440
are

93
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,400
based upon

94
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,639
and are based upon pretty low tech

95
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,440
attacks that people report in

96
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,600
we want people to report in more attacks

97
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,680
because the attacks we don't see

98
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,600
could be ones that could be very

99
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,360
damaging tomorrow

100
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,360
so with that what i'm gonna do is i'm

101
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,160
gonna

102
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,199
hand it over to jackie for part one so

103
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,120
go right ahead jackie all right thank

104
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,199
you mitch appreciate it so as mitch

105
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,840
mentioned um what we're after is

106
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,120
creating an environment where people

107
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,440
feel open to share things that are

108
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,120
happening in the

109
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,120
cyberspace of course we want them to to

110
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,880
say what's what's wrong what's what's

111
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,639
happening do i see something say

112
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,440
something but we're talking about um in

113
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,440
a little bit different angle here today

114
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,000
about underserved populations and are we

115
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,680
hearing them are we setting up this

116
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,199
environment where people feel

117
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,680
speaking so i'm going to start with some

118
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,800
data

119
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,160
so in 2020 the euros bureau of labor

120
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,680
statistics

121
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,960
tracked

122
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,360
information security and analyzation now

123
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,520
they don't track across board every

124
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,639
single role so think of this in just a

125
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,720
sample of the overall information

126
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,880
security population looking specifically

127
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,160
at the analyst

128
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,600
um the bureau also does not track every

129
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,360
single um nationality background role

130
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,960
what have you so we're looking

131
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,680
specifically from the underserved

132
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,440
population looking at black and african

133
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,400
american and hispanic or latino

134
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,520
so in 2020

135
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,759
11.9 percent of the analysts and

136
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,600
security analyst population eleven point

137
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,039
nine percent were black or african

138
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,160
american

139
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,160
fifteen point eight percent were

140
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,720
hispanic or latino

141
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,080
just five years prior to that not a

142
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,880
tough time here um five years prior

143
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,639
black and african american was only

144
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,240
three percent

145
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,639
and 5.2 percent for hispanic or latino

146
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,240
pretty significant jump in five years

147
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,479
next slide mitch

148
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:05,199
so

149
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,240
i think arguably there's a lot more uh

150
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,400
population there's a bigger population

151
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,800
of underserved team members working in

152
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,360
the information security space

153
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,479
so with that there's just a greater need

154
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,080
for awareness of of what this population

155
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,319
um what we're what we have to do we have

156
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,759
to unpack in

157
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,280
in this space

158
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,880
so coming

159
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,720
with bike

160
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,160
population

161
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,080
it's just a lot of history tons of

162
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,280
history

163
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,319
tons of um just inequality tons of just

164
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,000
lack of trust

165
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,960
so

166
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,960
when we're trying to make the

167
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,759
environment one that people feel

168
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,199
as though they're

169
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,280
open or that there's an open population

170
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,199
or excuse me open environment where they

171
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,599
can feel free to share

172
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,440
all of themselves and feel as though

173
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,759
they're going to have a fair shake um in

174
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,160
in this space there just needs to be a

175
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,199
greater awareness of the challenges that

176
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,120
underserved team members have faced to

177
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,680
date um by the time they get to you

178
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,039
there's just tons of history um that

179
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,800
they themselves have faced

180
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,400
and even more deeper history that their

181
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,440
people have faced inside of workplaces

182
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,840
and outside and i think we can all

183
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,560
appreciate that you don't believe your

184
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,560
experiences outside of the workplace

185
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,639
outside they don't stay at home you

186
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,679
bring all of that with you um into work

187
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,519
so there just needs to be a greater

188
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,919
awareness for what those what challenges

189
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,399
have been faced um this you don't have

190
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,360
to go far um nowadays the the media

191
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,399
makes it

192
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,120
quite open to to what's happening in

193
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,640
spaces now some of that you have to sift

194
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,600
through but

195
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,480
there's just a ton of history there so

196
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,800
for what um these underserved

197
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,480
populations have faced and this needs to

198
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,839
be a great awareness we need to just

199
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,800
look up on on what exactly they face

200
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,320
today

201
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,279
they're

202
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,200
step forward to that though an

203
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,240
acknowledgement of those barriers so

204
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,120
there

205
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,720
if there's something you haven't

206
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,040
experienced yourself it can be difficult

207
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,040
to understand that

208
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,640
yes that's real

209
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,800
there just needs to be an

210
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,120
open-mindedness to say yes i understand

211
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,720
these barriers the face and i hear you

212
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,600
to that being objective and listening

213
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,640
just really trying to

214
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,680
just peel away all the subjectivity all

215
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,519
of the i just

216
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:38,560
misunderstandings and just really

217
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,240
objectively listen

218
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,000
to team members

219
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,839
experiences what are they experiencing

220
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,920
inside the workplace and outside

221
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,000
in order to do that though in order to

222
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,519
get people talk there needs to be trust

223
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,080
you know our you we have to make sure we

224
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,800
are

225
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,080
ones who

226
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,040
listen

227
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,720
and don't judge

228
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,959
ones that keep things confidential that

229
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,760
should be confidential ones that do what

230
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,120
we say there needs to be that

231
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,200
trustworthiness in place in order to

232
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,600
even get people to talk me

233
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,120
next like

234
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,320
thank you

235

241
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,120
served as keynote speaker in numerous

242
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,079
talks um across the world in in this

243
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,640
space she had a great quote that just

244
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,320
fits this talk very very uh very well

245
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,320
inclusivity means

246
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,200
not

247
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,480
just we're allowed to be there

248
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,880
but we are valued

249
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,600
she says i've always said smart teams

250
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,760
will do amazing things

251
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,920
but truly diverse teams will do

252
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,760
impossible things um i

253
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,360
pulled this quote

254
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,320
specifically because she pointed out a

255
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,399
very very key point

256
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,959
we are not inclusive

257
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,519
just because our numbers have grown that

258
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,600
does not mean we've been inc we're

259
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,839
inclusive can't hold ourselves up as

260
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,839
being an inclusive workplace just

261
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,240
because numbers have grown

262
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,440
but are we making those people who have

263
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,680
been underserved those people

264
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,600
who have not had great numbers in our

265
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,480
space do they feel valued

266
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,480
that previous slide

267
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,959
helps them feel value do they are they

268
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,720
heard do they feel as though their

269
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,640
stories um are being really heard and

270
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,920
action is being taken accordingly but

271
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,839
great quote great quote from chloe if

272
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,120
you have not um crossed her her path or

273
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,040
haven't seen anything from her it's just

274
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,120
a great great ambassador if you will for

275
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,200
for the

276
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:55,760
next underserved

277
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,720
mitch

278
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,760
thank you

279
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,200
all right so we talk about the numbers

280
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,800
being better

281
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,120
um but again going a little bit here do

282
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,800
you appreciate the experiences

283
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,600
that underserved team members have have

284
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,639
experienced

285
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,440
and the value that they bring we know

286
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,480
diversity and thought is is extremely

287
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,120
valuable and underserved team members

288
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,920
have have had experiences that they

289
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,320
bring with them to the workplace that

290
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,360
has extremely great value do we

291
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,000
appreciate that are we really

292
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,800
digging in and understanding what they

293
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,440
have to share and are we considering

294
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,040
that valuable

295
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,160
again hearing their stories there are

296
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,639
stories to be told inside the workplace

297
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,360
and outside but you have to dig deep

298
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,680
it's really when we're talking about

299
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,200
stories what you really what you're

300
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,120
really after is how did this experience

301
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,720
that the underserved team member faced

302
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,720
how did it make them feel

303
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,600
and

304
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,880
how did that how did that experience did

305
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,760
it change anything about them

306
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,240
there's the experiences that they felt

307
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,480
have they're holding back are they are

308
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,120
there do they feel as though it's not

309
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,959
it's not safe to talk is it not safe to

310
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,680
share things that they feel are wrong

311
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,639
things they feel are risky have we

312
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,360
closed them off we have to really hear

313
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,000
the stories and value the stories and

314
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,240
make them understand that their stories

315
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,000
are heard in order to create this

316
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,079
environment where they really feel um

317
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,440
open to talk

318
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,639
um so

319
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,040
with that this environment can they

320
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,160
learn can they grow can they advance or

321
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,399
are we holding them back are we over are

322
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,480
we overlooking them are we overlooking

323
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,720
the great value that they bring

324
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,639
and making them feel as though they have

325
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,480
they're in a place where they can low

326
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,440
grow learn grow and advance and

327
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,199
lastly are your eyes open to injustice

328
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,720
to inequality do you know what that

329
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,160
looks like

330
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,839
it's really digging in to really

331
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,160
understand what that looks like and

332
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,000
being able to see it

333
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,959
see it in in what we call

334
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,000
we have become we've termed this we

335
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,839
termed this this word but

336
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,920
microaggressions but do you do you know

337
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,480
what that looks like and i'm not a big

338
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,680
fan of microaggression i think

339
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,440
aggression is aggression but

340
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,760
do you do you know what that looks like

341
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,440
and really

342
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,959
do you take it a step further which

343
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,399
we'll go a little bit deeper here next

344
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,360
is do you do anything about it

345
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,519
next slide

346
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,120
so to that end

347
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,480
um being an ally there's we we use that

348
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,440
term

349
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,120
so loosely

350
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,440
um but really do we know what it really

351
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,519
means to be an ally meaning to be an

352
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,480
ally

353
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,079
means to unite

354
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,560
or form a connection

355
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,079
or relation between yourself and another

356
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,120
group

357
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,880
so we're asking you today to challenge

358
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,320
yourself are you a true ally to the

359
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,600
underserved

360
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,399
meaning you're not just one that

361
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,399
understands the experiences you may

362
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,519
appreciate the experiences but have you

363
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,560
formed a connection or a relation

364
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,720
with the underserved

365
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,120
and are you an active

366
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,000
or passive ally

367
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,240
we like allies right it's great to have

368
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,360
an ally

369
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,600
it's better to have one that's active

370
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,399
that sees something and says something

371
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,720
that has the power to change something

372
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,120
and says i'm going to do so

373
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,399
so are you active or passive

374
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,399
all right

375
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,120
thank you very very much jackie

376
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,440
and again a little bit of background

377
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,920
i've been at iu health for

378
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,120
almost five years and before that i

379
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,800
spent eight years at temple health in

380
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,399
philadelphia in both cases i spent a lot

381
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,959
of time working directly with customers

382
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,600
on security incidents and getting them

383
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,440
reported in and one of the big

384
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,839
challenges i found over the past 13

385
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,839
years when doing investigations of

386
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,440
fishing incidents was

387
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,600
i had large groups of people that were

388
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,000
reporting these incidents in and others

389
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,160
that didn't and i wanted to find out

390
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,040
more about those that didn't

391
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,519
and did a lot of research here and the

392
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,600
big thing that came up was that

393
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,040
a lot of team members they just don't

394
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,279
feel comfortable reporting these in

395
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,440
and in a lot of organizations

396
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,839
retaliation is a very very serious

397
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,000
concern for people they believe that if

398
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,920
they report an insecurity incident

399
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,000
they're going to get blamed for it and

400
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,160
what further compounds this

401
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,560
is that there are no specific federal

402
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,320
statutes that

403
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,560
protect people that report in cyber

404
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,000
security issues

405
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,160
so say for example

406
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,120
i report in a large issue that

407
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,720
leads to a multi-million dollar data

408
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,320
breach

409
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,600
there is no protection for me under

410
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,360
federal law

411
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,360
and that discourages people from doing

412
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,360
so and let's be very clear there are

413
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,480
there are

414
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,160
local and state statutes but

415
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,160
the cost for ransomware attack cost of a

416
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,160
data breach these days

417
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,720
gets in the federal territory really

418
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,119
really quickly and

419
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,199
you're not going to be there for state

420
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,480
and local you're going to be dealing

421
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,520
federal

422
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,679
and again no protection people don't

423
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,280
feel like they can report these in and

424
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,880
it's one more reason of many

425
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,480
and

426
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,960
also building on what jackie said people

427
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,160
don't really trust their leadership

428
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,000
teams i'm going to come right out and

429
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,880
say it

430
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,240
they don't want to report any issues

431
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,760
because they're afraid senior leadership

432
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,120
is going to retaliate they're afraid

433
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,640
some senior vice president's going to

434
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,919
get upset because you destroyed their

435
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,840
pet project

436
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,720
and with the size of the i.t community

437
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,360
and the size of the security community

438
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,280
there's a significant concern about

439
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,200
people reporting in security issues

440
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,480
because they're afraid of losing their

441
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,240
jobs and they're afraid of not being

442
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,440
able to work elsewhere in the industry

443
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,799
i mean if you thought the security

444
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,799
community was small

445
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,679
it is and there's people that are scared

446
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,840
to talk about security incidents because

447
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,799
of it because they're afraid they won't

448
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,280
get a job anywhere else

449
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,320
and again building again to the lack of

450
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,080
applicable federal statute to protect

451
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,440
whistleblowers

452
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,559
people are not going to report in issues

453
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,440
the way you would like them to because

454
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,200
again we're dealing with the issue

455
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,039
senior leadership in many organizations

456
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,280
the trust is just not there

457
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,360
and the legal protection to report in

458
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,080
you can get all sorts of protection if

459
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,000
you report in accounting issues like the

460
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,799
woman at enron did however you're not

461
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,880
going to get them for cyber security

462
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,760
so

463
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,679
take a look at my friends over at the

464
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,600
society for human resources management

465
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,280
better known in the hr community as

466
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,880
sherm

467
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,840
and again building on what's out there

468
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,840
when hr professionals were asked if the

469
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,600
question of race-based discrimination

470
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,440
exists in the workplace we have a pretty

471
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,840
big dichotomy here 13 of white human

472
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,039
resources professionals agree and 49

473
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,080
black hr professionals think it exists

474
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,840
and when you ask the workforce the same

475
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,240
question 35 percent of black workers are

476
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,400
firmness but only seven percent of white

477
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,400
workers affirm this

478
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,280
this is a further issue meaning you're

479
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,120
not trusting leadership

480
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,520
when hr themselves

481
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,280
believes that discrimination could lead

482
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,280
to issues

483
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,400
you've got a serious problem

484
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,080
and the one that's been in the news

485
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,840
recently has been dr tim nick gabriel

486
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,880
over at who was formerly of google who

487
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,919
had pointed out issues in

488
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,640
their ai algorithms one of the big

489
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,039
challenges there she reported these in

490
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,520
got reassigned and subsequently let go

491
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,039
by google

492
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,440
and this has caused massive outcry in

493
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,120
the ai and intelligence systems

494
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,640
community in addition to the tech

495
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,480
community because of how she was treated

496
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,120
and again the gigantic allegation is she

497
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,480
would have been treated different had

498
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,120
she been whites let's call it exactly

499
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,840
for what it is

500
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,640
so doing some further research we talked

501
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,360
to we took a look at protocol magazine

502
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,919
in their article how tech hr departments

503
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,919
fail black and brown employees

504
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,600
the following concerns were noted in our

505
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,400
article first of all hr existing to

506
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,480
preserve the company not the individual

507
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,159
team members

508
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,320
questioning and harassment of team

509
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,559
members that report issues in this is

510
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,559
something that i will tell you i have

511
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,080
not seen in my current employer i have

512
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,159
not seen this at my previous employer

513
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,919
have i seen this elsewhere in the

514
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,280
industry

515
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,720
all over the place

516
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,640
and issues being reported in being

517
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,640
minimized or ignored

518
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,600
yes

519
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,799
this exists a lot more than people think

520
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,520
and people asking impacted employees for

521
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,760
burden of proof

522
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,280
that also

523
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,520
significantly exists and i've seen this

524
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,280
at all levels

525
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,480
again

526
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,559
we work to ensure

527
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,440
these issues do not occur at iu health

528
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,440
we have work to ensure they do not occur

529
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,760
at other organizations i've worked at

530
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,120
and we've always treated our customers

531
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,120
correctly however in the industry-wide

532
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,360
this is an issue

533
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,240
and there is a very big fear

534
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,320
that reporters will be accused of

535
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,400
creating them or ignored

536
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,120
have i had to undo a few situations

537
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,600
where technical managers have actually

538
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,240
gone after people for reporting in

539
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,159
security incidents

540
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,919
yes i have

541
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,440
did it go well for the manager trying to

542
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,440
cover their own but

543
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,760
absolutely not and i made sure of it but

544
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,000
the point is it happens

545
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
and it causes people to not want to

546
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,240
report these issues in and if you're a

547
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,720
minority in the workplace you don't want

548
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,720
to report these in because

549
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,919
they're going to do whatever some people

550
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:58,799
are going to do whatever they can to

551
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,200
make you look bad and get you fired and

552
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,200
the example of dr gabriel formerly of

553
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,080
google

554
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,960
is an example of that

555
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,080
so

556
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,080
we look at it this way when you take a

557
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,840
look what originally started as an issue

558
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,679
of trying to find out

559
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,520
why my customers were not reporting in

560
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,760
security issues after seeing that they

561
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,720
had actually received phishing emails

562
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,440
we

563
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,200
discovered we didn't have a security

564
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,840
reporting problem we have a larger trust

565
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,600
problem

566
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,799
we have a huge trust problem and it's

567
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,520
got significant dimensions to it and we

568
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,159
have to address it for exactly what it

569
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:37,120
is

570
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,880
if you're a minority and you report

571
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,880
reported a security and you reported a

572
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,400
security incident

573
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,679
people are afraid it's the end of their

574
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,520
careers

575
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,080
and that means that information security

576
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,559
bears the burden of not being trusted by

577
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,640
their own team

578
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,200
so we have to take a look at it as we

579
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,600
have to address these trust issues

580
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,159
before we address the security ones

581
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,080
because people aren't going to report

582
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,200
any issues

583
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,720
for security heck they're not going to

584
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,720
report on a broken light bulb if they

585
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,120
think there's going to be a problem

586
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,039
and i look at it this way

587
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,720
the best threat intelligence an

588
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,640
organization has is its own team

589
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,559
the iu health information security

590
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:21,679
team's stated goal is to have customers

591
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,200
call us first if they see something say

592
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,120
something call us

593
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,200
i get up in front of audiences with my

594
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,600
entire organization and tell them you

595
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,840
need to call us we will believe you

596
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,520
the reason why we do that is because

597
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,600
with new number and types of attacks

598
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,679
that you see these days

599
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,600
they're not going for

600
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,120
emailing a whole bunch of people they're

601
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,039
emailing one or two they're trying every

602
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,279
little angle they can to get in based on

603
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,080
who you are and what you have access to

604
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,760
there's a lot of people with access to

605
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,520
cash there's a lot of people with access

606
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,960
to systems

607
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,799
they're trying whatever they can and

608
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,640
it's targeted so

609
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,480
making sure that those people can call

610
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,840
us is critically important

611
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,480
and i'm going to call out upper

612
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,240
management here

613
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,400
they've had opportunities have they

614
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,440
succeeded

615
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,720
no they haven't

616
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,400
the reason why

617
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,640
because it hasn't been made a priority

618
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,720
for upper management so what's been the

619
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,320
priority

620
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,320
priorities for upper management in terms

621
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,480
of this have been about awards

622
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,720
platitudes and trying to get on the best

623
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,880
employer lists and trying to say you're

624
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,120
the employer of choice

625
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,679
that's been the goal of a lot of people

626
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:36,880
one of my professors at temple

627
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,200
university mike guglielmo actually gave

628
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,840
the advice that if you saw an employer

629
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,480
trying to get on the employer of choice

630
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,600
list or talk about being the best

631
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,080
employer they probably weren't and he's

632
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,320
been proven right so

633
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,960
and gotta hand it to mike and

634
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,320
what's been happening what are the

635
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,159
priorities been also it's been about

636
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,080
developing the workforce

637
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,679
leading through example or leveraging

638
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,440
our teams that's just not been there

639
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,520
it's about individualism

640
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,720
and a lot of the leadership and

641
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,320
development programs or psych

642
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,120
assessments used to vet people for

643
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,720
senior leaders positions and

644
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,080
organizations

645
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,480
they don't cover diversity equity or

646
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,440
inclusion or dealing with discrimination

647
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,279
it's not there

648
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,960
none of it and i've taken those tests

649
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,120
repeatedly in addition that i've taken

650
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,240
the classes to teach you how to create

651
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,159
those tests

652
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,360
so

653
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,720
it's not there

654
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,919
and also

655
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,159
a lot of senior leaders make their

656
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,159
careers about themselves

657
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,400
why because the incentive system is

658
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,240
based on their individual experiences

659
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,159
and so what we see is a lot of

660
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:43,679
minimization of issues and i'm going to

661
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,679
specifically call out all lives matter

662
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,200
here for that

663
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,000
and i'm also going to say big trend i've

664
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,440
seen with a lot of senior leaders has

665
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,400
been to minimize experiences

666
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,880
that are dissimilar to the paths that

667
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,960
they took to get to where they are

668
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,000
and these people don't understand

669
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,159
how that takes away the voice of the

670
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,000
others and specifically the voices of

671
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,360
their teams

672
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,039
and also many companies i've had

673
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,039
i should say very disparate reward

674
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,360
systems they reward condescending

675
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,960
managers

676
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,200
that talk themselves up that'll throw

677
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,880
anyone under the bus

678
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,400
this is something that i've seen

679
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,799
repeatedly in my career the people that

680
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,559
do the most bus throwing are the ones

681
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,559
that get ahead

682
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,440
and realistically if it's not a metric

683
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,120
that's on their performance

684
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,799
matrix

685
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,360
it's not something they care about and

686
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,919
trust in a lot of places isn't there so

687
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,440
we have a bigger issue and that is

688
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,679
people that are in charge are not

689
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,520
measured they don't measured us

690
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,039
so that's where we got to start

691
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:51,760
so

692
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,039
today i'm going to give some rules for

693
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,279
security leaders

694
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:59,039
first first rule you serve and lead by

695
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,120
example

696
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,880
i had a good talk with my boss last week

697
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,799
had my one-on-one actually and the first

698
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,640
thing i said to him is

699
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,720
i do what i do in this organization and

700
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,120
i push the way i push and the reason why

701
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,559
is because if my team doesn't see me

702
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,200
doing it they're not going to do it

703
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,159
so

704
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,679
you do this

705
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,520
and you have to be in a servant

706
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,360
leadership mindset

707
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,360
because you have to empower you have to

708
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,320
uplift your team members you have to be

709
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,559
in that level if you do not have these

710
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,799
two things i will guarantee every

711
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,240
initiative you have

712
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,399
especially the e and i ones

713
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,480
are going to fail

714
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,880
i will guarantee it i will bet money on

715
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,000
it

716
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,880
and

717
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,399
i will win

718
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,799
and be very clear about this

719
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,559
the information security mindset of

720
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,640
being based on superiority

721
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,559
being condescending to others or putting

722
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,480
others down

723
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,799
if you do this you are not in a position

724
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,640
to hold your position you are not a

725
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,679
leader

726
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,200
and you are not going to champion these

727
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,880
initiatives because what you're going to

728
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,880
do is going to backfire and people are

729
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,320
going to leave the organization because

730
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,440
of you

731
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,159
i'm calling exactly what i've seen this

732
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,880
is how it works

733
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,799
so what do you want to do you want to

734
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,440
educate find out educate yourself find

735
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,760
out what your current situation is

736
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,760
take the time to talk to your team

737
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,360
members take the time to talk to your

738
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,240
organization find out what's going on

739
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,679
and don't talk you listen you take notes

740
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,000
you assess and you take the time to

741
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,720
understand the stories you're being told

742
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,480
and this isn't security

743
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,080
you're not being grilled on how well you

744
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,840
know nmap or sims or encryption

745
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,240
don't try and prove you're an expert you

746
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,480
know why you're not you're not going to

747
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,559
be and the second you think you're an

748
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,720
expert your hubris takes over you become

749
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,360
a bad leader and you're out

750
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,279
don't let hubris get the bet get the

751
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,120
best of you

752
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,880
this is about

753
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,279
listening understanding your customers

754
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,200
and educating yourself so that you can

755
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,840
better meet their needs and very

756
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,559
specifically over the past couple of

757
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,399
years and i'm going to come right out

758
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,480
and say ever since i started my

759
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,960
organization i've taken the time to sit

760
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,200
down sometimes for hours at a time with

761
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,360
my team members to listen to them listen

762
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,720
to their stories listen to their

763
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,640
struggles because

764
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,640
this is something that's taken from

765
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,520
national prominence because of numerous

766
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,960
large incidents

767
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,520
over the past several years

768
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,480
however it doesn't mean it didn't exist

769
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,640
and we have to understand it's existed

770
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,399
it's been these situations have been

771
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:37,600
brought to light

772
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,760
we have to listen so we can better

773
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,720
respond to meet our team's needs

774
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,480
and more importantly be yourself

775
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,520
so and what you need to do is after you

776
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,080
talk to everyone look at the services

777
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,480
that your team undertakes take a look at

778
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,159
what you can do to do them better

779
00:29:58,159 --> 00:29:59,760
and examine how you can improve

780
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,360
communication

781
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,559
using

782
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,640
everything you've learned as a goal so

783
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,200
i'm going to give a real life example

784
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,520
i write my own security training reason

785
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,760
why i write it is because i don't trust

786
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,840
what the companies put out there

787
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,840
also because i spend a lot of time

788
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,919
listing my customers

789
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,080
and when i'm sat down with medical

790
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,000
record clerks that are living in bad

791
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,760
neighborhoods that

792
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,520
just make twelve dollars an hour tell me

793
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,120
how they saved up for six months to buy

794
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,120
their son a computer

795
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,960
you realize they're not going out to

796
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,960
best buy to spend a lot of money on

797
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,240
antivirus

798
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,399
you have to adapt what you're doing for

799
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,960
the people that can't afford

800
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,080
you have to adapt for your environments

801
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,240
and your communication and communication

802
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,799
plans have to reflect the needs of your

803
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:47,919
people

804
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:50,960
what they need and their experiences and

805
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,640
if they don't do that

806
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,919
i'm going to tell you they're going to

807
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,240
go nice cartoon and they're going to

808
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,720
throw it out

809
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,799
and so what you want to do is you want

810
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,120
to use communication and education as

811
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,399
part of your improvement

812
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:05,360
treat

813
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,360
what you learned from speaking with your

814
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,240
team like a risk management plan plan it

815
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,880
out articulate it talk about it and i

816
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,960
can't say this enough talk about it

817
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,760
whenever you can with your team

818
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,760
you have to make it constant because if

819
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,960
you don't

820
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,799
your team's going to think oh it's

821
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,640
another month something else we'll talk

822
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,360
we'll talk about bagels next

823
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,600
no that's

824
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,640
counter to the goals of what we're

825
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,720
trying to do

826
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,360
so with that you've got to go that extra

827
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,840
mile you need to make yourself available

828
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,080
everyone has your cell phone everyone

829
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,360
knows how to get

830
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,559
a hold of you

831
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,880
and you make yourself available because

832
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,960
ultimately your team's success is

833
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,880
predicated upon how well you respond

834
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,600
when

835
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,039
people need you

836
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:52,320
and there's something i always say to my

837
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,600
teams

838
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,799
you

839
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,720
deal with customers

840
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,440
when they are not having good days

841
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,320
and you are it is extra important for

842
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,559
you to do so

843
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,120
and so with that we focus on improving

844
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,600
our processes for intake triage and

845
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,600
response because of that

846
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,159
aka you always believe everyone you

847
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,320
always research

848
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,080
you always make sure the right people

849
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,600
are triaging it so you don't bounce

850
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,279
people around from cues or have them go

851
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,279
to dead letter office

852
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:25,200
and you always respond with clear

853
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,039
communication

854
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,519
and make sure those improvements address

855
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,600
those preconceived biases that a lot of

856
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,440
people have and quite frankly a

857
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,679
significant amount of minorities have

858
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,760
with dealing with

859
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,000
information security

860
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,080
you have to have this in your training

861
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,240
communication plans

862
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,039
and you can't assume everyone's the same

863
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,919
not everyone is like you not everyone is

864
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,240
like our techie friends

865
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,519
we have to adapt but to adapt we have to

866
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:58,880
listen we have to learn we have to make

867
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,399
every attempt to understand

868
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:06,240
and i'm gonna say something else out

869
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,080
this is something that i've seen that

870
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,640
disturbs me in this field

871
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,000
i don't like using the word ally because

872
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
to me it's a 25 cent word that sits on

873
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,600
top of actions

874
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,600
people don't care about words people

875
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,080
care about well what are you doing in

876
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,240
the infamous words of miss janet jackson

877
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,240
what have you done for me lately

878
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,799
that's what it comes down to

879
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:34,399
so and also trying to prove by negation

880
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,640
that somebody didn't have the

881
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,880
experiences that they did because you've

882
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,480
never seen it

883
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,039
or your personal experiences or counter

884
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,600
that doesn't get rid of the issues it

885
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,360
actually makes them worse and it shows

886
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,519
you to be willfully ignorant

887
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:51,360
because it shows you to only care about

888
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,080
your point of view not theirs and that's

889
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,320
something we can't have

890
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,799
and also i look at it this way and this

891
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,640
is again a discussion i always have on

892
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,559
my team

893
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,320
only so when you only celebrate once a

894
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,360
year

895
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,520
you ignore people the other 11 months

896
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,399
and yes i am referring to pride month

897
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:13,760
and i am referring to black history

898
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,719
month

899
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,079
we can do better than this

900
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,520
because again if it's for one month

901
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,280
people are going to think what month is

902
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,199
next for me to be ignored

903
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,879
for until the next year rolls around

904
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:27,760
again

905
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,960
that's not how it works

906
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,320
so

907
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,599
also going to come right out and say

908
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,199
something else you're not going to be

909
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,079
perfect you're going to have issues so

910
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,839
you've got to be really careful about

911
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,679
what you say and do so you don't

912
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,679
perpetuate them

913
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,679
you will have them but more importantly

914
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,599
you're going to have to deal with them

915
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:48,560
and

916
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,879
i tell people especially in the security

917
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,199
field especially in my position you're

918
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,960
not judged on whether a security

919
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,719
incident happened or not you're not

920
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,240
judged on that you're judged on how well

921
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,240
you recover and how well you help the

922
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,040
organization be resilient here you're

923
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,280
going to be judged on how resilient you

924
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,359
are and how well you help address these

925
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,760
issues issues happen

926
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,680
this is why you have partners across the

927
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,200
organization this is why you talk to

928
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,880
your teams because

929
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,160
you're not going to resolve these teams

930
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,839
by going into yourself you're going to

931
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:19,599
resolve these issues by talking with

932
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,200
your team talking through them and

933
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,599
resolving them

934
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,440
and also

935
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,599
even if someone is a member of a group

936
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,560
or uh or a minority or

937
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,800
they're not perfect

938
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,520
everyone has their own biases even

939
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,480
insane clown posse said this back on on

940
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,880
the song halls of illusions

941
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,160
everyone's got their own view of the

942
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,800
world you have to recognize this

943
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,960
not everyone is the same you also have

944
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,200
to recognize this and you have to

945
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,680
approach it differently

946
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,920
so in other words listening is more

947
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,920
important than anything else to be able

948
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,480
to understand and recognize these

949
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,760
and come up with different approaches

950
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,200
a lot of a lot of good things we can do

951
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,400
we just have to do them better

952
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,400
and when you have these issues

953
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,640
it's not about going into yourself or

954
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,960
wishing it go away if you don't openly

955
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,560
and confront and address these issues

956
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,200
they're not going to get resolved

957
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,480
and i'm going to

958
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,640
say something else here silence is

959
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,800
approval if you go into yourself you

960
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,800
don't respond and you wait and you don't

961
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,960
call it out immediately

962
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,800
people are going to think you approve

963
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,119
and if you say something later people

964
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,760
are going to think you got told that you

965
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,680
didn't like it

966
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,480
so

967
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,599
i'm

968
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:42,800
going to say something here might give

969
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,560
me a little trouble if you wait for the

970
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,480
corporate point of view

971
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,400
that's also considered silence and i can

972
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,320
tell you i've seen so many people who

973
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,000
revealed their characteristics to me by

974
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,079
going i don't know what to say about

975
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,680
that i have to wait to say what someone

976
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,200
upstairs says

977
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,240
no

978
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,280
you know what that shows you are it

979
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,640
doesn't show your person shows you're a

980
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,520
puppet

981
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,760
and that's not acceptable

982
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,640
so if you're not out there openly saying

983
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,079
something if you're not addressing these

984
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,520
issues when they happen

985
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,079
and if you're saying i have to wait

986
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,359
then what you're doing is you're

987
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,119
ignoring people

988
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:17,119
and you're making it worse

989
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:21,680
please i beg of you don't do this

990
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,400
and

991
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,240
ultimately us as leaders have to set

992
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,440
this example

993
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,800
our goal

994
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,800
is to build trust

995
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,960
my goal here is to build an information

996
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,599
security organization so that customers

997
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,079
feel comfortable talking to us about

998
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:38,640
things they discover in the course of

999
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,920
their jobs

1000
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,880
that could affect how patients are cared

1001
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,560
for at iu health that is my job

1002
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,440
if

1003
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,520
we are not able to effectively mitigate

1004
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,440
risks to our patients i have no business

1005
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,920
being in indianapolis

1006
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,640
and if we put things in the way of

1007
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,720
taking care of patients

1008
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,720
and we we put biases we put anything in

1009
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,200
the way we're not doing our job

1010
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,839
and i might as well find something else

1011
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:10,560
and with the huge amount of attacks that

1012
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,960
we have we have to be better at doing

1013
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,599
this because we're losing intelligence

1014
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,040
on these attacks

1015
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,880
because people don't want to report

1016
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,960
these issues into us

1017
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,320
people are scared to report them in

1018
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,560
they're afraid of retaliation they know

1019
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,520
there's

1020
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,200
there's no federal protection for cyber

1021
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,440
security whistleblowers

1022
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,520
and to be very clear

1023
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,920
threat intel that you get from the

1024
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,440
threat intelligence companies is not

1025
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,520
going to tell you about these attacks

1026
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,560
it's not going to tell you about

1027
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,000
robocalls

1028
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,440
it's not going to tell you about spear

1029
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,680
phishing your customers your key members

1030
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,520
that you need to build trust in they are

1031
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,599
the ones that tell you that

1032
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,920
and the best security resources we have

1033
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,760
we already work with them

1034
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,800
you're not going to spend a million

1035
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,079
dollars to get a product that's going to

1036
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:55,119
replace

1037
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,280
somebody who calls you up and lets you

1038
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,760
know every time something hits a

1039
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,480
clinical chair's mailbox

1040
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,480
and i'm not speaking a theoretical i'm

1041
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,359
speaking true experience

1042
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,920
we need to have better collaboration and

1043
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,160
better trust and and we have to have

1044
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,400
this we have to address these issues

1045
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,720
because if we don't

1046
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,359
we are ignoring not only a large portion

1047
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:21,520
of our population we're also putting the

1048
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,599
organization and the patients we care

1049
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,920
for at risk

1050
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,320
so with that i'm going to turn that over

1051
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,800
to kat and

1052
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,359
thank you all

1053
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:34,720
thank you mitch

1054
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,680
hello everyone i'm katrin and i'm going

1055
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,400
to give a perspective as a team member

1056
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,880
uh not a leader and i'm going to give

1057
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,760
that perspective based on over 20 years

1058
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,880
i've spent working in the idt space

1059
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,040
within pharmaceuticals medical device

1060
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,520
and healthcare

1061
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,680
and i can tell you that over the course

1062
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,920
of time that i've been working in it in

1063
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,359
most meetings i attend i'm very aware

1064
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:04,240
that i'm the only non-straight member

1065
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,079
i'm also usually one of two or three

1066
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:08,000
women most of the time to be honest

1067
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,680
though because of the areas in which i

1068
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,319
work in operations and security i'm the

1069
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:13,839
only woman

1070
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:16,800
this has not drastically changed despite

1071
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,880
the numbers we're seeing in the area

1072
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,880
that i sit this experience has actually

1073
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,839
stayed fairly consistent in my own

1074
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:25,440
experience as such

1075
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,000
i'm very careful about how i present

1076
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,680
myself

1077
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,599
i try not to be too girly

1078
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,839
i try not to be too dikey i try not to

1079
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:36,720
be too much overall essentially i'm

1080
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,880
really careful how i present myself

1081
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,839
because i have to be careful about that

1082
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:45,680
work is not a safe place to do that

1083
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,440
and i'm just saying it straight out work

1084
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,200
is not a safe place

1085
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,800
to be myself

1086
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,599
okay next slide

1087
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:56,000
so the numbers are better but that

1088
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,160
picture's a macro picture overall

1089
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,640
in our own area that we work

1090
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,200
as a team member i would ask you do you

1091
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,359
know about team members who don't share

1092
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:09,599
your life experience

1093
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:11,119
are they comfortable sharing their

1094
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:12,400
stories with you

1095
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,440
maybe you don't know that life

1096
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,119
experience because they're being really

1097
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:16,560
really careful about what they reveal

1098
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,400
about themselves

1099
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,720
are you ever a witness to intolerance

1100
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,440
and justice or inequality and this may

1101
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,599
be inside work or outside of work not in

1102
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:27,280
your position as a leader but just

1103
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,960
observing your neighbors or at a

1104
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,119
restaurant or what have you

1105
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:32,640
and has that experience ever made you

1106
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,640
uncomfortable uncomfortable because you

1107
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,640
didn't know what to do you wish you had

1108
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,119
said or done something i am the hero of

1109
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,960
every story i replay in my head a few

1110
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,640
hours later when i come up with that

1111
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,720
great thing i was gonna say

1112
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,040
so if that is a wish you have and you've

1113
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,040
been uncomfortable there is something

1114
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,400
you can do next slide

1115
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,599
one way to do something is first you

1116
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:56,960
have to make the choice

1117
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,400
and that's the choice to actively

1118
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,079
invisibly take a stand against

1119
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,240
harassment when you see it in other

1120
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,119
words

1121
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,440
i as a team member and as a person i'm

1122
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,000
asking you to lead by example

1123
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,079
a great resource is an organization

1124
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:11,920
called hollaback it's a global

1125
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,280
people-powered movement to end

1126
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,680
harassment in all its forms as they say

1127
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,599
in their mission statement we believe

1128
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:20,400
that we all deserve to be who we are

1129
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,440
wherever we are it's extremely inclusive

1130
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,599
i've included their

1131
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,160
address there and bystander resources

1132
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,000
it's a wonderful resource to use to

1133
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,280
review this

1134
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,359
they also provide training on how you

1135
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:34,800
can help protect your neighbors your

1136
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,960
family your co-workers

1137
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,040
pretty much anyone when you see bias and

1138
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,079
harassment collide in front of you

1139
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:45,440
next slide please so

1140
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,599
as a bystander resource that they

1141
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:49,680
provide they have a system called the

1142
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,960
5ds

1143
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,480
these are different methods that you can

1144
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,079
use to support someone who's being

1145
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,680
harassed

1146
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,520
it emphasizes that harassment is not

1147
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,599
okay and it demonstrates to the people

1148
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:01,760
in your life that they have the power to

1149
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,359
make our communities and workplaces

1150
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:05,680
safer don't underestimate the power of

1151
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,040
an individual in very small moments

1152
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,680
the five d's are distract

1153
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,119
delegate

1154
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:14,480
document

1155
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,200
delay and direct

1156
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,160
the first one next slide please

1157
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,800
is distract and this is i will

1158
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,440
personally say this is the easiest

1159
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,839
it's actually one of the most effective

1160
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:30,640
because it works in a very small way but

1161
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,480
it works with all the social norms that

1162
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,000
we're used to using

1163
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,319
the idea behind distract is

1164
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,280
you

1165
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,040
see harassment going on

1166
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,920
and you distract you distract not by

1167
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,079
having any sort of confrontation or

1168
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,079
giving notice to the person who's doing

1169
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,560
the harassment you distract by reaching

1170
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,720
out to the person who's being harassed

1171
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,960
or interrupting the flow so one way

1172
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,800
would be to this person is being

1173
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,359
harassed and you ask them all the time

1174
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:58,640
and then you open up a conversation

1175
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,560
about something completely different the

1176
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,079
important part is is you ignore the

1177
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:04,880
harasser and what that's tapping into is

1178
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,520
attention gives power so even if we're

1179
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,040
all sitting on the bus like in this

1180
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,640
picture and you're pretending not to see

1181
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,440
it the person doing it

1182
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,079
has harnessed the power of your silence

1183
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,079
as tacit approval

1184
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:20,160
so this is this is subtle but it's

1185
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,720
extremely strong so when you ignore them

1186
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,560
and address the person being harassed as

1187
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,359
a person you have validated them and

1188
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:29,720
invalidated the harasser this is

1189
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,599
non-confrontational

1190
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:33,440
they can usually pick up on it if they

1191
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,520
choose to or you can even do something

1192
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,280
as subtle as like dropping your phone on

1193
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,960
the floor then making a fuss picking it

1194
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,720
up and then like apologizing to them for

1195
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,400
dropping the phone and ignoring the

1196
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,560
person it breaks the chain and it breaks

1197
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,000
the power of the silence of people

1198
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,319
feeling trapped that they're witnessing

1199
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:51,200
this happen next slide for the next d

1200
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,880
please

1201
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,440
the other option is to delegate and this

1202
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,000
is usually effective in places uh like a

1203
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,560
store or a restaurant or a place with it

1204
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,319
where you can find someone who is in a

1205
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:04,400
position of authority and that is where

1206
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,880
you can go to them and say hey this is

1207
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:07,839
happening

1208
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:09,680
this would be if you've ever ridden on

1209
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,920
public transportation it's where someone

1210
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,200
goes up and says to the bus driver

1211
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,800
shit's going down in the back

1212
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,480
it's basically getting the person who

1213
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,480
has authority involved

1214
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,760
now a careful caveat about delegate

1215
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,800
is not involving the police immediately

1216
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,400
because depending on

1217
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,560
what the harassment situation is the

1218
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,640
person who's being harassed may be more

1219
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,800
worried about having an encounter with

1220
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,880
any sort of law enforcement or law

1221
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,400
official

1222
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,400
but delegate is a great way

1223
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,400
to call attention to the fact that it's

1224
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,359
happening

1225
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:43,920
and have it officially addressed

1226
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,800
third slide please for the third d

1227
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,720
document

1228
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,960
if

1229
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,640
you are uncomfortable

1230
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:53,920
actively

1231
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,599
getting involved

1232
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:57,280
there is a way that you can document

1233
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,880
because most of us have smart phones at

1234
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,520
this point you have seen this over and

1235
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,880
over again in social media where

1236
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,440
something has been documented and it has

1237
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,800
has been used to call attention to

1238
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,240
something

1239
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,760
it's very helpful with a couple

1240
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,560
important caveats you always need to

1241
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,920
make sure that the person who was

1242
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,359
harassed

1243
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:17,599
they need to agree or they need to have

1244
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:19,040
the right to use it

1245
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,960
it is definitely not cool

1246
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,440
to document something and share it or

1247
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,280
take it somewhere

1248
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,880
and use it without their permission

1249
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,520
because essentially you have treated

1250
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,440
them with great great disrespect by

1251
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,359
doing that they're already feeling like

1252
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:35,440
they don't exist or that they're alone

1253
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,440
because of the harassment if you do that

1254
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,920
without they're okay and their control

1255
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,680
over it you're actually furthering that

1256
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,359
trauma

1257
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:45,599
next slide please

1258
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:47,520
delay

1259
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,920
this is great for a lot of occasions

1260
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,319
when harassment happens and literally it

1261
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,319
happens fast enough or you weren't

1262
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:56,400
paying 100 attention and you're not even

1263
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,400
aware of what really went down until

1264
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,760
after it's happened

1265
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,839
the graphic is great because it uses the

1266
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:03,680
stuff that happens by cars going by or

1267
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,760
bicyclists something happens it's

1268
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,680
harassment and before you can do or say

1269
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,040
anything

1270
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,400
they're gone

1271
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,319
but what you can do actually has a great

1272
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:13,760
impact and that's why connecting with

1273
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,680
the person that was harassed and making

1274
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:16,400
sure

1275
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,319
hey are you okay i witnessed that

1276
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:21,040
happening that was not okay

1277
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,640
because what you've done

1278
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,680
is take again tacit or silence equals

1279
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,640
approval

1280
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,880
even if you're on 100

1281
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,880
not sure what just happened

1282
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,640
asking the person

1283
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,240
validates them and says hey you're a

1284
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,240
person i'm connecting with you i'm

1285
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,680
concerned are you okay what just

1286
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:38,800
happened

1287
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,640
that didn't look okay

1288
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,400
that gives them the chance to reconnect

1289
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,480
with people and not feel like they're

1290
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,520
alone

1291
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,440
and that no one else cares so this can

1292
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,359
be a very powerful tool so that point

1293
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:51,040
where you're kicking yourself like why

1294
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,559
didn't i say or do anything in the

1295
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:54,960
moment you can do something as an

1296
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,240
individual and it actually has a

1297
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,319
tremendous impact

1298
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:00,640
next slide please

1299
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,640
direct

1300
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,160
and before i even say anything about

1301
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,400
this a note about safety you don't ever

1302
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,839
want to get hurt trying to help someone

1303
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:09,440
out you don't want to escalate the

1304
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,760
situation so use direct

1305
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,400
very carefully this is not a call out to

1306
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,000
be a hero

1307
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,040
but it is possible to call out

1308
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,800
and use a direct form of interaction if

1309
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,720
you feel it's safe if you feel it's

1310
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,559
warranted and if you're sure that the

1311
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:26,160
person who's being harassed is going to

1312
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,760
be okay with that

1313
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,440
and that would be as simple as directing

1314
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:33,599
a comment saying hey that's unacceptable

1315
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:35,599
and basically calling out the behavior

1316
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:37,200
for what it is that sexual harassment

1317
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,800
hey don't say that that's that's

1318
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,079
harassment

1319
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:41,760
but you have to be very careful with it

1320
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,079
because if you are acknowledging the

1321
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:46,000
person doing it you're also empowering

1322
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,640
them and you can escalate the situation

1323
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,800
the person who's being harassed may also

1324
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,119
just want to get the heck out of there

1325
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:54,720
and get away from it because their

1326
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,319
safety is involved and it could also

1327
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,559
impact your safety

1328
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:00,800
so the next slide for the final d

1329
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,599
well that was it sorry

1330
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:06,400
so the biggest point to remember with

1331
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,839
any of these is that you as an

1332
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,400
individual can do something

1333
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,400
and that you have a lot of power as an

1334
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,319
individual because of your ability to

1335
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:15,440
connect

1336
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,760
and to affirm and to validate

1337
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,119
at this time in our history with

1338
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:20,319
everything that's been going on in the

1339
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:22,480
past few years it's incredibly important

1340
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,000
that we show up for each other and that

1341
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,559
we're active bystanders not just tacit

1342
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:27,760
witnesses

1343
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,200
who choose to ignore which is

1344
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,480
essentially

1345
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,000
approving it

1346
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,520
research has shown

1347
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,240
that even a knowing glance making eye

1348
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,240
contact with someone can reduce the

1349
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,240
trauma for the person who is targeted

1350
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,240
because you have formed a bond and you

1351
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,000
have sent a message that you saw what

1352
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,119
happened

1353
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:47,599
so even if you're not sure what to say

1354
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:49,680
it's perfectly okay to

1355
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,160
look at them and say i don't know

1356
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,960
what to say i don't know what to do

1357
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,800
just reach out and make that connection

1358
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,800
and make sure they know that you see

1359
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,720
them as a person and that they're not

1360
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,040
alone

1361
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:06,480
and that was my last site i believe

1362
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,319
thank you all very very much for coming

1363
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:10,960
today we really really do appreciate it

1364
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,839
