going to be super happy we're making

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,719
devstech ops actually work in our

17
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,320
environments in our organizations

18
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,160
wherever it is that we're developing

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,440
software

20
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,000
but before we begin just in case you

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,680
don't know who i am

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,680
let me introduce myself so like i said

23
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,440
i'm melissa miller first and foremost

24
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,399
i'm a hacker a researcher and a security

25
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,319
advocate now what do i mean by security

26
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,159
advocate means i like to get out and do

27
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,920
stuff just like i'm doing right now talk

28
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,320
to all you share some ideas talk about

29
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,320
problems that we face in security hear

30
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,000
what you're thinking tell you what i'm

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,080
thinking or what i found in my research

32
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,000
and see what we can do to get better

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,840
that's what it's all about

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,240
i am also a be so

35
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,960
hmm what does that mean well we'll talk

36
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,479
about that in a second but i'ma be so

37
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,720
for s p global ratings so if you've

38
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,119
heard of standard and poor yeah that's

39
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,680
that s p so maybe like the s p 500 you

40
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,280
might be familiar with that as well

41
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,119
that's who we are now i said you know

42
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,280
what is the beso business information

43
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,360
security officer i'm not going to go

44
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,360
into details right now but if you want

45
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,200
there's a link i wrote a blog on it when

46
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,720
i got the job because i knew people were

47
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,040
going to ask melissa you you got this

48
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,520
job as a be so what the heck is that

49
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,439
so check it out if you're interested

50
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,560
otherwise just know it's business

51
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,719
information security officer i lead the

52
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,079
security strategy for s p global ratings

53
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,560
now my history in tech

54
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,799
it's it i've been a lot of places 10

55
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,119
years as a developer that's how i got

56
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,679
started and then i spent the last 16

57
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,000
years in security i pivoted from a

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
development job into a pen testing job

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,720
i then became a consultant for a while

60
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,879
and ultimately now i find myself at smp

61
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,360
and then finally i'm an author a blogger

62
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,599
a podcaster i kind of

63
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,040
try to do a lot of different things

64
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,120
again just ways that i can interact with

65
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,319
our community and really exchange ideas

66
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,400
and just again it's all about trying to

67
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,840
make us better

68
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,080
so that's it that's enough about me you

69
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,000
have heard enough let me tell you about

70
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,480
a few other really important people that

71
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,920
are going to be a part of today's

72
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,480
discussion no they're not here with me

73
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,080
but it's important that you know the

74
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,760
history so we're talking devsecops

75
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,239
how many of you actually know the

76
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,280
history of where dev ops and devsecops

77
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,720
came from

78
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,040
not everybody does so let me give you a

79
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,440
quick history lesson so i'm going to

80
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,159
rewind you all the way back to the year

81
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,800
2008 god i can't believe that's actually

82
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,120
13 years ago

83
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,360
wow some of you might not have even been

84
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,680
working in like full-time jobs yet by

85
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,400
then

86
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,959
um and that's great i love it i'm glad

87
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,239
we got new faces but that's why i'm

88
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,959
going to tell you this story so in 2008

89
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,799
this gentleman his name is patrick

90
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,360
dubois he lives in belgium

91
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,760
and he was a software developer among

92
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,599
other things and he was really

93
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,040
frustrated with

94
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,440
just the difficulty that his development

95
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,879
teams had getting software from you know

96
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,799
the conceptual stage and getting it

97
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,959
written and built and tested all the way

98
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,640
through to deployment

99
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,720
and he was looking for a way to make

100
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,879
this easier how could he reduce the

101
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,599
friction between his dev teams and the

102
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,280
operational teams that he had to work

103
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,000
with who were ultimately the ones he had

104
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,760
to satisfy in order to get his software

105
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,280
to production

106
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,879
but he wasn't the only one thinking this

107
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,799
this is andrew schafer

108
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,239
andrew schaffer was thinking some of the

109
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,200
same things back in 2008 in fact i don't

110
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,879
recall the name of the conference but at

111
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,280
a conference they were both going to

112
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,238
andrew schaefer put out an idea for a

113
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,000
birds of a feather session you know

114
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,279
where you get a few people together and

115
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,199
you talk about some idea

116
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,000
and

117
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,680
patrick saw this he thought it was great

118
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,080
he's like okay great i'm i'm i'm gonna

119
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,919
go to this so patrick signed up well

120
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,840
patrick was the only one who signed up

121
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,280
and in fact he was the only one who

122
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,040
showed up because andrew didn't show up

123
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,520
because there was only one person

124
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,280
and so

125
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,360
long story short they ended up meeting

126
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,280
later and

127
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,040
they got to talking about this idea of

128
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,880
how they would unite developers and

129
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,600
operations together break down the walls

130
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,000
make everything happy for everybody so

131
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,840
we could deploy software a whole lot

132
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,600
faster

133
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,240
and from that idea they spawned

134
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,120
devsecop stage or devops days excuse me

135
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,039
which is the first time that we know of

136
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,400
that term being used dev ops and it was

137
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,560
just this idea of we can make software

138
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,039
delivery so much faster if we just break

139
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,759
down all these barriers

140
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,759
but who's missing from this conversation

141
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:16,960
you see

142
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,039
this was 2009 and we started having

143
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,280
conferences about this

144
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,840
it wasn't until 2012 that security

145
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,440
started to realize like okay this is a

146
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,039
real movement we got to do something

147
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,080
about

148
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,919
organizations were starting to adopt it

149
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,639
amazon was doing millions of deployments

150
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,720
you know every year

151
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,039
everybody was jumping on this idea of a

152
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,120
devops bandwagon

153
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,560
so two gentlemen josh corman and gene

154
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,000
kim in 2012 gave what is kind of their

155
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,800
now pretty infamous talk security is

156
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,600
dead long live rugged dev ops and the

157
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,000
whole idea was if we're going to do this

158
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
devops thing and we're going to be super

159
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,160
fast and i know they cited that like i

160
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,479
think at that point amazon was averaging

161
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,039
deployments every 11 seconds in their

162
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,639
devops pipeline

163
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,000
these guys are like look if we're going

164
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,120
to do this we got to think about

165
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,240
security all differently so we are going

166
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,400
to jump in and they talked about this

167
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,360
idea of rugged devops where software

168
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,039
didn't just get built secure but it had

169
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,680
to be built ruggedly and you can go find

170
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,960
that talk it's definitely still online i

171
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,160
encourage you to check it out sometime

172
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,039
but

173
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,000
we're now in the year 2021

174
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,639
and we still as security people seem to

175
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,800
struggle with this and some of the

176
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,000
conversation begins with just who is

177
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,800
ultimately responsible for security

178
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,960
so prior to my current role i worked for

179
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,840
a company called sneak and last year we

180
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,880
did our state of open source security

181
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,680
report we talked about i went into a lot

182
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,360
of research on a lot of different topics

183
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,199
but one of the things we did was we we

184
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,919
had a survey and we surveyed literally

185
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,520
thousands of people about you know how

186
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,720
security

187
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,720
open source devsecops how all that

188
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,720
looked in their organization so one of

189
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,560
the questions i asked and it was a

190
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,919
follow-up to what we had asked in the

191
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,360
previous year was

192
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,919
who's responsible for the security of

193
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,240
your software and your infrastructure

194
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,080
and what you see here is kind of some

195
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,840
interesting results

196
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,560
now they could answer that question with

197
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,160
multiple answers so they could choose

198
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,240
all three they could have chosen all

199
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,759
four which are all five which have been

200
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,360
a little weird but

201
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,479
you see here that like 85 said devs are

202
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:33,840
responsible for the security of the

203
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,160
software but only 55

204
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,759
thought security was involved in that

205
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,960
and only 35 thought operations

206
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,240
when it came to infrastructure it

207
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,919
leveled off a lot more you can see the

208
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,479
impacts that infrastructure has code and

209
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,080
cloud native technologies are having

210
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,479
here because now suddenly devs aren't as

211
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,039
responsible operations predictably came

212
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,879
up quite a bit and security still sat

213
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,400
there only half of them thought security

214
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,759
played a part in securing the

215
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,280
infrastructure

216
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,720
so these are really interesting

217
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,319
attitudes that we're seeing and it makes

218
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,879
it really complex when we want to bring

219
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,680
security to the dev ops discussion

220
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,720
because no one really wants to say who's

221
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,680
responsible for security

222
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,080
but that's not the only problem

223
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,120
devops has created a whole

224
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,759
gamut of new technologies and new

225
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,080
approaches to things that we didn't have

226
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,000
back when i was a software developer 16

227
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,360
years ago

228
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,360
and so there's a lot of issues and a lot

229
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,599
of them start with just knowing what's

230
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,279
in your software

231
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,839
modern day development is more complex

232
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,719
than it's ever been before because we've

233
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,399
added all these things to ultimately

234
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,399
make it faster i know that seems odd

235
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,399
more complex development means faster

236
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,600
development

237
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,920
alyssa you've lost your mind

238
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,839
i promise you it does actually make

239
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,600
sense but we've created a lot of

240
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,519
technologies and you know maybe you're

241
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,560
familiar

242
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,040
with the this question here what is in

243
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,519
your software think about if you

244
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,720
remember that

245
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,440
breach in 2017 equifax

246
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,519
where apparently and we'll never really

247
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,120
know for sure but apparently they had

248
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,519
some open source struts libraries that

249
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,600
had known vulnerabilities they didn't

250
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,200
know that they were there and they got

251
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,880
compromised

252
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,640
this is the challenge we have now where

253
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,480
does it come from

254
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,200
well it's how we write our code so back

255
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,680
in my day god do i sound old when i say

256
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,720
that

257
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,399
back when i was a software developer

258
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,920
that sounds a little better

259
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,240
um you know if you had an application

260
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,200
that was 100 000 lines of code it meant

261
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,120
that developers in your organization

262
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,480
wrote 100 000 lines of code

263
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,800
but it's not that way anymore

264
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,959
you see the open source community cloud

265
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,519
native have all become involved in our

266
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,040
development in an effort to make things

267
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,600
faster as we've got devops developers

268
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,279
working to quickly

269
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,880
construct code and deploy it we've

270
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,399
created this open source community that

271
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,040
is wonderful and it means that i don't

272
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,600
have to write a 100 000 lines of code

273
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,279
because a lot of the functionality i may

274
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,760
need i go grab from the open source

275
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,800
community

276
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,720
and i just do that in the form of

277
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,200
dependencies that i introduce into my

278
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,880
software

279
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,040
so here's a great example there's a java

280
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,040
application all right and this is the

281
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,720
you're seeing the manifest here now this

282
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,959
java application is only 280 lines of

283
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,200
code that this developer wrote

284
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,600
great okay super simple app right seems

285
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,440
really simple

286
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,560
yeah but they introduce eight

287
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,839
dependencies through the manifest

288
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,480
okay

289
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,800
so i've got eight packages of software

290
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,880
that i'm going to go pull from the open

291
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,399
source community

292
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,399
that are going to now be a part of my

293
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,640
software all right not the end of the

294
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,760
world

295
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,519
the only problem is

296
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,399
each of those dependencies each package

297
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,240
that i introduced has its own

298
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,800
dependencies 89 subdependencies and

299
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,040
suddenly my 280 lines of code has turned

300
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,800
into 2.4

301
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,880
million lines of code that i'm

302
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,279
responsible for as a developer that i'm

303
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,079
responsible for as a security

304
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,760
practitioner trying to secure my

305
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,320
applications do you see the problem now

306
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,480
this is the challenge that devops has

307
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,320
brought to us from just a software

308
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,000
development perspective where we've

309
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,760
gotten faster and faster and faster

310
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,600
we've introduced this idea of

311
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,680
dependencies and if you're if you're a

312
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,360
node.js developer in particular if

313
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,120
you're working with npm you know the

314
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,720
story you go and you open up your

315
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,480
project you go get some coffee while you

316
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,000
wait for npm to reload all your

317
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,360
dependencies

318
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,720
that's what software development's like

319
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,560
these days but it's not just software

320
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,040
developers what about our ops teams i

321
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,800
love this quote from kelsey hightower is

322
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,959
a great tweet he put out a while back

323
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,800
i've latched onto it i'm never letting

324
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,800
it go he says so you want to roll your

325
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,880
own application platform well great all

326
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,279
you need to know is you need to know

327
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,399
linux and docker and kubernetes and

328
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,800
istio and prometheus and fluentd and

329
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,440
grafana and jaeger and harbor and oh my

330
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,399
god

331
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,160
are you kidding me

332
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,839
this is what we expect our ops teams to

333
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,680
be able to deal with

334
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,399
this is cloud native world hey great

335
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,240
devops cloud native we're going full

336
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,079
bore straight ahead

337
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:09,920
oh we've got our ops and our devs teams

338
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,519
working together they're really excited

339
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,519
they you know but oh my god look at what

340
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,760
we're asking of them when we talk cloud

341
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,839
native have you seen this yet this is

342
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,480
the cloud native uh computing

343
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,839
foundation's uh cloud native

344
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:24,399
landscape

345
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,079
now this is actually a few months old so

346
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,120
it's probably even worse than this now

347
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,760
these are all the technologies that go

348
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,320
into building a cloud native environment

349
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,959
holy crap

350
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,639
i've made this as big as i can and you

351
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,160
can't even read the names on most of

352
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,760
these you might recognize some of the

353
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,360
logos

354
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,200
these are all the things that our devs

355
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,920
and our ops teams need to be experts in

356
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,360
they need to understand how to configure

357
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,399
all these and so when we say that

358
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,560
they're responsible for security we want

359
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,240
them to be able to secure all these

360
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,560
things how in the heck are they going to

361
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,399
do that

362
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,200
it's just not feasible so okay great

363
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,720
that's why we have security teams right

364
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,079
security to the rescue we're going to

365
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,079
hop in because security is going to come

366
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,440
in and we're going to do that appsec

367
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,320
thing

368
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,480
sure we'll get to that appsec thing

369
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,839
right after we're done worrying about

370
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,480
perimeter security and network security

371
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,160
yeah well by the way endpoint security

372
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,040
because you got to worry about all those

373
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,959
people who got laptops and desktops on

374
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,720
our network

375
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,399
we got to think about policy management

376
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,680
we got to build all the policies that

377
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,200
are going to govern all this we got to

378
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,680
think about operations and then maybe we

379
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,920
can get to application security but

380
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,680
application security also of course

381
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,560
brings with it data security are you

382
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,079
exhausted yet listening to me because

383
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,399
i'm exhausted talking about this

384
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,040
this is crazy stuff this is everything

385
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,040
that falls under our security umbrella

386
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,800
and if you work in security or you've

387
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,560
talked to anybody in security you know

388
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,399
that we all have unlimited budgets to do

389
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,040
all this right

390
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,240
no we don't

391
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,959
we have limited resources we have

392
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,560
limited budgets just the same as

393
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,720
everybody else so trying to

394
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,040
manage all of this is so complex for the

395
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,519
security team but that's okay i have an

396
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,760
answer we have tools lots and lots of

397
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,000
tools all the security products are

398
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,920
gonna make us better they're gonna help

399
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,839
secure us god this looks just like that

400
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,279
cloud native

401
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,760
doesn't it it's the same thing

402
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,440
lots and lots of technologies that we

403
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,360
have to understand we got to understand

404
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,800
infrastructure security endpoint

405
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,560
security application security messaging

406
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,320
security web security security

407
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,839
operations and is in response risking

408
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,279
compliance threat intelligence mobile

409
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,920
security oh god i'm stopping i'm losing

410
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,600
my breath

411
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,680
what are we doing here

412
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,000
nobody can know all these things right

413
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,839
so if we're saying that you have to have

414
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,920
all of these tools to make your software

415
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,279
more secure and to defend your

416
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,880
environments

417
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,880
is it any wonder we're still seeing more

418
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,880
and more breaches every single year

419
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,680
no

420
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,440
it's not

421
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,680
and we in security are responsible for

422
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,480
many of the problems that we have

423
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,000
now when it comes to application

424
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,360
security and specifically when i'm

425
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,920
talking devops and how do we bring the

426
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,600
security conversation to devops

427
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,360
i have been to easily

428
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,440
20 or more talks

429
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,440
at various conferences over the last

430
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,279
three years

431
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,360
talking about devsecops

432
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,760
now remember devsecops

433
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,839
we started talking about this in 2012

434
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,519
josh corman gene kim thank you guys

435
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,959
i'm still hearing talks 20 of them in

436
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,440
three years that i went to

437
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,079
and what i noticed is none of them seem

438
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,360
to in my opinion at least get it

439
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,040
and so i started really sitting down and

440
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,880
listening i went back through a lot of

441
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,720
these talks that i had heard and i went

442
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,240
out and i looked up some others i could

443
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,920
find online

444
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,759
and i wanted to see what's the message

445
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,519
here what aren't we doing from a

446
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,440
security perspective is it the message

447
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,880
that's wrong or are we just not

448
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,320
implementing it

449
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,160
and what i found was there's a lot of

450
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,519
myths that we perpetrate as security

451
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,880
practitioners when it comes to devsecops

452
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,480
things that we say you gotta do things

453
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,480
that we say are absolutely necessary

454
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,639
attitudes that we have ways that we

455
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,440
approach this that are just plain dead

456
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,959
wrong

457
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,480
you almost got me to drop enough bomb

458
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,160
there but i caught myself

459
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,839
gonna be good today i know it's circle

460
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,240
citycon but i still must behave

461
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,199
so

462
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,800
what i'm gonna talk to you about today

463
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,040
what we're diving into next i'm gonna

464
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,279
talk to you about five of the myths

465
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,160
five themes that i saw in these talks or

466
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,920
that i've heard from security

467
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,600
practitioners even within my own

468
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,399
organizations

469
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,079
things that i've heard

470
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,600
as a consultant

471
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,959
that companies were talking about that

472
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,000
they thought they had to do to make

473
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,120
devsecops work this is where i want to

474
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,440
start to break down these myths

475
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,600
it starts with you today

476
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,279
we're going to start to do devsecops

477
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,279
better and it starts now

478
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,680
myth number one

479
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,399
tool automation is how you achieve

480
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,359
devsec ups

481
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,520
how many times have you heard it

482
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,039
oh devps like ops we're moving really

483
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,199
fast companies like amazon are deploying

484
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,959
every 11 seconds this means we need to

485
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,880
get all the security tools and they must

486
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,119
all integrate and be automated in our

487
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,640
pipeline and that's how we're going to

488
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,760
make devsecops happen

489
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:23,679
is that what

490
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,280
devops was

491
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,599
think back a minute what did i tell you

492
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,559
that

493
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,600
you know as those guys back in 2008 2009

494
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,400
2012 are putting this together

495
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,880
were they talking tools

496
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,039
no

497
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,679
patrick dubois andrew schafer when they

498
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,120
got together it wasn't about how do we

499
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,960
get better tools it was how do we get

500
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,440
groups of people working together

501
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,000
ultimately what they wanted was a

502
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,400
culture oh there's an evil term we hate

503
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,080
when we talk about culture yeah yeah

504
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,760
because it's hard to do

505
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,320
culture's tough how do i desi how do i

506
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,200
build a culture that's hard

507
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,960
but that's the reality when we're

508
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,520
talking devops or more importantly now

509
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,840
devsecops we are talking about building

510
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,760
a culture that means we cannot focus on

511
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,679
tools and yet that's what we what we

512
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,840
always do

513
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,320
proof i went out i went to google and i

514
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,880
checked search stats

515
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,840
in searches that included the term

516
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,840
devsecops

517
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,840
what did i find number one was devsecops

518
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,440
just that was the search number two i

519
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,240
think was devsecops um

520
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,600
and then i i only remember what the

521
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,039
other word but it was

522
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,880
not inconsequential

523
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,200
number three was tools so defcycops

524
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,320
tools was the number three most searched

525
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,880
term including devseconds

526
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,120
devsecops practices

527
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,360
didn't show up until number nine

528
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,360
methodology was 12 it was 10 excuse me

529
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,600
so now we're at the bottom of that first

530
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,120
page of results from google thank you

531
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,080
devstuck ops roles the people side of

532
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,520
this was number 12 and devsecops culture

533
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,760
didn't show up until number 14. so we're

534
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,080
halfway through the second page of

535
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,639
results

536
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,000
think about this if i want to build a

537
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,760
culture it's not just about tools and

538
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,600
technology it's about the people it's

539
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,720
about the processes and that evil g word

540
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,120
governance oh everybody hates governance

541
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,720
because governance is you yuck it's

542
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,679
policy

543
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,240
it's audits it's all this yucky stuff

544
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,000
how are you going to build a meaningful

545
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,440
culture and know if it's working if you

546
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,360
don't have governance if you're not

547
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,360
monitoring your metrics seeing what

548
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,480
works

549
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,799
you know i i told i referenced this stat

550
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,480
over and over again already from gene

551
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,720
and josh's

552
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,799
talk about amazon deploying every 11

553
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,520
seconds how does amazon know that

554
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,360
because they have meaningful metrics and

555
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,360
they have governance that says

556
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,559
we're going to make sure that people are

557
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,880
following what we're what our processes

558
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,320
are they're following our standards

559
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,679
they're doing the things they're using

560
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,679
the tooling and we're going to make sure

561
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,280
we know what's working and what isn't so

562
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,280
we can continue to get better that's how

563
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,039
you build a culture

564
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,400
now why is this culture so important

565
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,080
the motion of today's devsig ops

566
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,039
pipeline is very conflicting

567
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,559
with this

568
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,400
new world in particular of cloud native

569
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,760
which always seems to come along with

570
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,159
the devsecops discussion we've got these

571
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,480
conflicting motions we've got security

572
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,960
who's trying to push left god love us as

573
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,720
long as i've been in security we have

574
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,760
been talking about the need to push left

575
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,520
16 years

576
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,280
in fact we were talking about it when i

577
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,200
was a developer we were talking about

578
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,640
pushing left not just in terms of

579
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,799
security but also our testing we wanted

580
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,200
qa to push left how do we do this

581
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,600
testing sooner

582
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,919
but now we've introduced cloud native

583
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,760
and the influence of developers is

584
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,159
pushing further to the right

585
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,400
developers now through things like

586
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,200
infrastructure as code are divided

587
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,520
excuse me defining the very

588
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,039
infrastructure on which they're going to

589
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,480
deploy their software

590
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,240
so their influence moves farther and

591
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,640
farther right into the pipeline

592
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,720
but then you've got ops ops is having to

593
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,600
push up the stack right because ops can

594
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,200
no longer worry about just bare metal

595
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,200
servers and operating systems they need

596
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,760
to understand things like kubernetes and

597
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,120
the database

598
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,240
layer and they need to be a part of

599
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,320
creating containers all this is defined

600
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,240
in code they're working in things like

601
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,320
terraform but oh my gosh

602
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,799
this isn't just about plugging blades

603
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,120
into into server racks and things like

604
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,440
that this is no we're writing code as

605
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,679
operations folks this is where the sre

606
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,240
role has come from

607
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,840
and then finally pushing down into

608
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,480
granular levels of involvement in the

609
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,799
pipeline is our business

610
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,960
we've got business people writing user

611
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,799
stories they're putting new information

612
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,799
on our backlogs all the time they are

613
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,520
directly defining our sprints many times

614
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,760
they're typically at least involved in

615
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,840
our sprint planning if we do that if

616
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,080
we're true ci cd maybe they don't even

617
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,159
have planning and so they're there as

618
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,120
part of helping prioritize various user

619
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,640
stories

620
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,720
so we have all these conflicting motions

621
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,360
and this is why culture is so important

622
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,679
because having a culture around

623
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,720
devsecops is what's going to allow us to

624
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,960
align these various motions together and

625
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,360
coordinate them and make them happen and

626
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,080
that feeds right into our second myth

627
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,640
the second myth that i always hear when

628
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,520
i go

629
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,039
and talk to security people about

630
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,840
devsecops is that shared responsibility

631
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,600
means

632
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,559
everyone's responsible for security

633
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:49,760
have you heard this term shared

634
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,760
responsibility before this is talked

635
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,360
about a lot when we talk devops and

636
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,400
devsecops it's this idea that everybody

637
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,320
has a shared responsibility for getting

638
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,919
software out

639
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,159
and that's the key because when i say

640
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,760
shared responsibility means everyone's

641
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,360
responsible for security well what are

642
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,360
my devs in my sres saying

643
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,080
they're asking what the hell about us

644
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,320
what about all those times you told us

645
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,400
security you said you had the answers to

646
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,400
make this right and you're still telling

647
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,360
us we're not secure

648
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,080
devsecops shared responsibility this

649
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,760
this shared responsibility which is at

650
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,400
the core of devsecops culture

651
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,640
is not just about security

652
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,640
how arrogant are we as security

653
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,400
practitioners that we want to go in

654
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,760
there and say it's a shared

655
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,760
responsibility you all must do security

656
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,440
it's not just about security what about

657
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,159
us as security practitioners how do we

658
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,039
take on a shared responsibility now i

659
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,799
promise you this is one of

660
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,640
very few times and it is the only time

661
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,559
in this presentation that you will see a

662
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,440
venn diagram for me i hate these things

663
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,480
but

664
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,559
i had to use it it was the only way that

665
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,080
i could really think of that i could

666
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,840
illustrate this next point

667
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,880
shared responsibility is everybody is

668
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,600
responsible for the pipeline the

669
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,799
deployment of software that means all of

670
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,120
our goals have to align so let's talk

671
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,559
about those goals for a minute you have

672
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,320
developers what are the developers

673
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,400
motivations what are they trying to do

674
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,039
they're trying to deploy fast and

675
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,520
they're trying to minimize works in

676
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,279
progress

677
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,400
if you work in a development

678
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,360
organization maybe you've seen the

679
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,840
kanban boards that that our development

680
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,760
teams use to manage this they know

681
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,039
what's in the backlog they know it's a

682
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,400
work in progress they know what's done

683
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,720
what's been deployed and that work in

684
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,400
progress column is always the one that

685
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,320
we're trying to minimize

686
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,240
we don't want things sitting in work in

687
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,240
progress any longer than we have to the

688
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,039
key to getting to a quick ci cd work

689
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,279
we're continuously deploying new

690
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,480
software

691
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,799
at that 11 seconds mark

692
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,240
it's about reducing work in progress

693
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,840
moving things through the pipeline

694
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,159
quickly

695
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,240
now for ops what they're worried about

696
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,400
is uptime and responsiveness if things

697
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,960
are running slow or servers are down or

698
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,520
containers are failing or are kubernetes

699
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,159
clusters are having problems that's

700
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:17,600
their world that's what they're worried

701
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,520
about all that infrastructure stuff when

702
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,279
it comes to software they are worried

703
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,240
about

704
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,400
is it available and is it running

705
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,240
efficiently

706
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,919
and then security of course we're

707
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:29,440
looking to eliminate vulnerabilities and

708
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,360
defend our systems we want to get rid of

709
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,799
the risk we want to make sure we don't

710
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:36,480
get hacked so we are working on this

711
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,200
but when i talk shared responsibility in

712
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,559
devsecops this is where it happens it's

713
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,840
when those intersect when my security

714
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,799
team understands that security is

715
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,640
responsible for deploying fast and

716
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,919
minimizing works in progress

717
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,720
security is responsible for uptime and

718
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,360
responsiveness

719
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,679
same thing for ops they're responsible

720
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,360
for deploying fast and minimizing works

721
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,120
in progress as well as eliminating

722
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,159
vulnerabilities and defending systems

723
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:09,840
and our devs understand that they are

724
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,960
responsible for eliminating

725
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,799
vulnerabilities and defending systems

726
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,760
and making sure that their software

727
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,480
is up as often as pos as much as

728
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,880
possible and that it's responsive

729
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,240
everybody has these in their goals that

730
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,480
is the shared responsibility that we're

731
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,679
talking about when we talk about

732
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,200
devsecops

733
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,279
so we need to be building this into our

734
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,600
culture this understanding that

735
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,679
everybody is not only responsible for

736
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,400
security everybody is responsible

737
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,400
for making that pipeline as efficient as

738
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,600
possible and everybody is responsible

739
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,120
for making sure that the software in our

740
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,039
production environments runs as

741
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,200
efficiently as possible and that it is

742
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,600
always available at least to whatever

743
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,760
service level it is that we are shooting

744
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,600
for

745
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,880
that

746
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,880
that's shared responsibility

747
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,559
oh this is sounding fun isn't it but

748
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:01,679
we're not done yet that's only the

749
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,039
second myth

750
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,400
i got more

751
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,360
we're busting miss left and right

752
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,320
myth number three

753
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,400
build gates into the pipeline to achieve

754
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,919
security and devsec ops

755
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,600
those of you that know me and follow me

756
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,159
on twitter or have talked to me in any

757
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:23,520
way about software development and

758
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,919
devsecops you know this is probably my

759
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,320
single biggest pet

760
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,159
peeve

761
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,720
the story the narrative that in order to

762
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,200
do devsecops in order to bring security

763
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,159
into devops we need to put gates in the

764
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,960
pipeline where we do the security thing

765
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,880
where we validate the security of the

766
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,360
software

767
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,600
reality is

768
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,520
we've been doing this forever

769
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,360
when i go to these and we haven't

770
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,679
changed right when i go to these talks

771
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,080
this is what people suggest they suggest

772
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,360
that well you know when something moves

773
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,600
from the backlog to the point where to

774
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,679
the coding phase well you need to do

775
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,240
your threat modeling then

776
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,520
and then

777
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,120
when you're ready when that code gets

778
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,279
committed well now we need to do our sas

779
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,039
and das tools and then when we're before

780
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,279
we can deploy after we built and tested

781
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,520
it well now we need to do our das tools

782
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,120
and then after it's deployed we gotta do

783
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,520
penetration testing

784
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,840
this creates friction these create long

785
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,919
feedback loops that slow down our

786
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,159
pipeline more on that in a minute

787
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:27,840
we need to think in terms of

788
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,520
frictionless enablement when it comes to

789
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,520
devsecops how does security

790
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,919
frictionlessly enable the pipeline to

791
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:37,760
flow remember security is responsible

792
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,640
for

793
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,120
you know fast deploys and reducing works

794
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,640
in progress that's our responsibility

795
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,399
now so we have to be all about

796
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,039
frictionless enablement

797
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,159
to do that we need to make our security

798
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,919
practices

799
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,360
part of those phases they cannot be

800
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,679
gates in between let's talk a little bit

801
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,000
more about this now when i hear people

802
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
talk about gates in the pipeline usually

803
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,520
what they're talking about is breaking

804
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,600
the build you'll hear this discussed a

805
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,200
lot of times in conversations about devs

806
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,760
like ox so how does that work well i've

807
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,760
got developers who are constantly

808
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,520
developing they're writing comm they're

809
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,720
writing their code they're committing

810
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,760
their code they're writing more code

811
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,919
they're committing more code and at some

812
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,000
point that code is going to get promoted

813
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,240
when that code gets promoted it gets

814
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,240
built and when that code gets built it

815
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,720
gets tested and this is all automated as

816
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,279
well right this is where the ci portion

817
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,679
of our pipeline starts that continuous

818
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,080
integration and then from there it's

819
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,520
going to reach a point our testing is

820
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,679
done and the last piece is then now

821
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,039
we're ready to move to release we're

822
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,640
going to promote again but now we have

823
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,480
to test it again this is where we do our

824
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,919
regression test

825
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,159
and now we package it up and we deploy

826
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,240
it

827
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,640
so where does security fit

828
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,000
we put in gates we want to break the

829
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,880
build so what do we say we say that yes

830
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,279
we test as part of your build so after

831
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,440
your software builds we run our security

832
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,840
tests in an automated fashion maybe it's

833
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,480
source code analysis or sas tools maybe

834
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,880
we do source code or yes source code

835
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,480
analysis or software composition

836
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,240
analysis excuse me sca

837
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,320
and what do we do oh you have too many

838
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,679
vulnerabilities or you have to make

839
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,039
critical or severe or high

840
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,399
vulnerabilities

841
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,600
you have packages that have

842
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,919
vulnerabilities and need to be updated

843
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:23,120
we're going to push the pipeline

844
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,240
backward and you're going back to

845
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,600
development

846
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,279
what happens when we go to release same

847
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:29,440
thing we launch testing we test their

848
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,840
packages oh sorry this doesn't match up

849
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,320
to our expectations

850
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,640
we're going to break it we're putting

851
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,320
that gate in that gate stays closed you

852
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,840
can't go to production we're sending you

853
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,080
all the way back to development this

854
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,760
breaks cicd this breaks the whole

855
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,720
concept of devsecops

856
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,000
so how do we get to a true ci cd

857
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,520
well we've got our developers doing what

858
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,200
they do we want them coding and

859
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,799
committing all day that's what we want

860
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,240
them doing constantly coding and

861
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,080
committing putting new code into the

862
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,840
repository keep building up our packages

863
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,600
integration still looks the same we

864
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,679
build and then we test so somewhere in

865
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,000
this process we've got those

866
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,919
you know we're doing various testing

867
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,200
that's great

868
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,720
and then our release

869
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,880
package it up test it and deploy it

870
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,760
great

871
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,559
the key here is

872
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,320
we need to enable these developers

873
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,840
differently

874
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,360
when i talk frictionless enablement i'm

875
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,799
talking about giving the developers the

876
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,519
ability to do

877
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,360
much of the security work before

878
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,519
anything gets built

879
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,080
before it moves into that testing phase

880
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,320
so that when we get to the testing phase

881
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,640
vulnerabilities we're finding

882
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,320
are not so critical that we have to

883
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,880
break a build instead we're moving

884
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,240
toward the point where our

885
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,399
vulnerabilities are

886
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:49,919
low enough severity that i can just

887
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,360
throw them in the backlog with a high

888
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,880
priority

889
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,559
and they just get addressed in the next

890
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:55,519
cycle

891
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,919
another key to this is the speed so when

892
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:01,039
security is focused on making our ci cd

893
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:04,399
flow quickly on deploying fast i know

894
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,159
that because i'm deploying on average

895
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,880
every 11 seconds

896
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,399
then it's not going to take long for

897
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,960
that p1 security vulnerability i just

898
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,279
got put into the backlog to get fixed so

899
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,919
if that security vulnerability goes

900
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:19,760
through and is deployed to production i

901
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,519
know very quickly it will be addressed

902
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,600
by our developers because there's a p1

903
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,200
user story out there that's going to get

904
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,279
grabbed next

905
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,559
and i can do the same thing with the

906
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:31,919
testing that happens pre-deployment

907
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,159
this is our goal this should be our goal

908
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,559
as security practitioners working in

909
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,720
application security when we're working

910
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,440
in devsecops with a ci cd pipeline we

911
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,279
don't want to push that pipeline

912
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,480
backward

913
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,080
we need to keep it flowing and make it

914
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,919
faster and faster because that is what

915
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:50,240
is going to give us rugged devops we

916
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,760
become rugged

917
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,640
when

918
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,559
those things get fixed quickly and we

919
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,799
continue to improve the software at a

920
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,200
high rate of speed

921
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,799
that's where we need to go as security

922
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,240
practitioners it's not about building

923
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,039
gates and stopping that pipeline

924
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,880
it's about enabling our developers to

925
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,600
move faster to do this quicker and to

926
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,399
understand the security concepts that we

927
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,640
want them to be aware of that we want

928
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,480
them to incorporate into their code and

929
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,120
giving them tools to do it

930
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,120
how many of your developers have sas

931
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,320
tools

932
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,120
sca tools that run within their ids that

933
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,440
run on their repos when they commit code

934
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,039
those packages are there that tooling is

935
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:33,279
there that's one piece of it training

936
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,760
them giving them that awareness working

937
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,640
with them and enabling them with things

938
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,039
like reference architectures

939
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,039
design standards things that they can

940
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:44,720
reference back to and quickly address

941
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,720
the security needs of the user story

942
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,440
they're working on

943
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:53,519
and this brings us to our next myth

944
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,120
myth number four

945
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,600
is that threat modeling is incompatible

946
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,440
with devsecops

947
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,519
i was told this once i was working as a

948
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:02,799
consultant and i worked with this

949
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,919
organization who had a very well

950
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:07,919
well-defined threat modeling process

951
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:09,760
it was great i mean they had spent years

952
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,440
building it they went through it they

953
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,040
had it down to where they could do this

954
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,520
they called it um i don't even remember

955
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,918
it wasn't architecture review but they

956
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:19,520
it was like security architecture review

957
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,639
or something like that it's not

958
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,918
important but basically it was threat

959
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:23,760
modeling and they had it down to where

960
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,359
they could do it within a day

961
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:26,960
they could bring everybody together they

962
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,239
had certain artifacts that had to be

963
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,000
created in advance but everybody got

964
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,079
together in one day and they did this

965
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,119
thing

966
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,719
and i remember coming out of one of

967
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,000
these sessions

968
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,079
and talking to a developer who told me

969
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,879
he was so excited he couldn't wait until

970
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,480
they didn't have to do this anymore

971
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,719
because they were going to a devsecops

972
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,760
model

973
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,280
and you can't do threat modeling if

974
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,440
you're in devsecops

975
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,480
wrong

976
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,239
wrong wrong wrong if you saw my talk

977
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,560
yesterday on threat modeling you know i

978
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,918
hit this and we're about to talk about

979
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:56,879
it again

980
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,560
i promised you yesterday i would get in

981
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,880
deeper into this discussion so if you

982
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,960
saw that talk you saw this

983
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,560
for those of you that didn't

984
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,760
2019 circle cim puppet released their

985
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,280
state of dev ops report

986
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,960
in that report they analyzed a lot of

987
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,640
different things about devops culture

988
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,640
and so forth but one of the things they

989
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,440
looked at was security practices in the

990
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,720
devops

991
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,920
community

992
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,680
they looked at the frequency with which

993
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,359
we practice certain security tasks

994
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,920
versus the importance or the impact that

995
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,240
they have on the security posture of the

996
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,240
software

997
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,680
and they plotted it out in four

998
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,119
quadrants

999
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:38,880
this upper left quadrant those things

1000
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,320
that we do a lot

1001
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,160
that

1002
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,720
don't necessarily have the impact we we

1003
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,359
would want on security posture that's

1004
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:48,720
where we see things and i know it's hard

1005
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,839
to read but you see things like

1006
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:51,680
penetration testing

1007
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,720
dependency checkers static code analysis

1008
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,520
security requirements

1009
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,160
but it's when we go down here

1010
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,000
to the lower right

1011
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
those things that

1012
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,400
we don't do very often they're not as

1013
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,280
well adopted but have significant impact

1014
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,520
we see this one that's circled it says

1015
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,920
security and dev teams

1016
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,839
collaborating on threat models

1017
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:21,520
this is how important threat modeling is

1018
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,160
threat modeling has such a massive

1019
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,480
impact on the security posture of our

1020
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,240
software and it's one of those things

1021
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,680
that allows us to push further left

1022
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,680
but when i say threat modeling people

1023
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,440
start to think of this

1024
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,040
and you probably do too if you've done

1025
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,119
any threat modeling you see that data

1026
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,119
flow diagram up there and you think

1027
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,640
about oh yeah for threat modeling we

1028
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,839
have to put together this whole data

1029
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,280
flow diagram that maps out data

1030
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,119
throughout our entire system where it

1031
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:49,200
flows where it's stored where it's

1032
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,960
processed the

1033
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,040
trust boundaries that it crosses and we

1034
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,480
got to know the whole system so that

1035
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,640
requires us to have a big heavy design

1036
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,240
session to make that happen doesn't it

1037
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,359
[Music]

1038
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:04,560
well no wonder we don't think it's

1039
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,480
compatible with devsecops and then by

1040
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,440
the way

1041
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,800
after we've done that we're going to use

1042
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,520
stride this thing this framework that we

1043
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,240
use to classify threatened models

1044
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,359
here's how we're going to classify our

1045
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,280
threats and we're going to use really

1046
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,000
con

1047
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,760
technical terminology from the security

1048
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,119
world we're going to talk about spoofing

1049
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,880
and tampering and repudiation and

1050
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,640
integrity

1051
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,680
what

1052
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,680
no one understands that come on we're

1053
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,960
the only ones who get that but then

1054
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,760
we're going to say that we're going to

1055
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,440
create attack trees so there's another

1056
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,359
process we have to map out all the

1057
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:34,800
threats and how they turn into attack

1058
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,720
trees to to realize those threats and

1059
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,839
and we're gonna realize that some of

1060
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,640
those some of those attack patterns

1061
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,920
are impossible

1062
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,520
so we're gonna scratch those off now

1063
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,520
that's a lot of wasted effort oh and now

1064
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,800
we're gonna use dread because now that

1065
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,480
we've got our threats and our tax mapped

1066
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,040
out well we got to prioritize them so we

1067
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,040
are going to use dreaded as a framework

1068
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,720
to help us do that and then we're going

1069
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,160
to do this in the cyclical fashion we're

1070
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,200
going to have to do this over and over

1071
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,240
again

1072
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,680
so that's all complex so then we're

1073
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,640
going to create this thing called the

1074
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,160
capex taxonomy because that's going to

1075
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,078
make everything easier

1076
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,359
does that look easy to you

1077
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,920
doesn't to me this is why people don't

1078
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,800
think devsecops and threat modeling can

1079
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,040
possibly go together

1080
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,480
but

1081
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,480
i said that's a myth

1082
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,680
and it is

1083
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,520
because we can do this so much

1084
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,800
differently

1085
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,040
we need to think a little bit

1086
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,320
differently

1087
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,320
go back to the basics of threat modeling

1088
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,880
for a minute and i know i've got

1089
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,560
a colleague of mine she's probably

1090
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,839
disappointed because i don't have the

1091
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,839
slide in this particular deck you saw it

1092
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:40,400
yesterday this is the infamous timmy

1093
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,359
turner

1094
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,200
attitude

1095
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,520
threat modeling all it really is is

1096
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:50,800
asking what could possibly go wrong

1097
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,359
that's it

1098
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:54,880
we don't need all these frameworks and

1099
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,800
things we don't need all this

1100
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,880
information we don't need

1101
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,760
big design cycles

1102
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,000
all we need to do is in plain language

1103
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,400
define what are our critical assets and

1104
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:11,599
what could possibly go wrong with them

1105
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:12,560
now

1106
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,480
we also want to push left

1107
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,960
how much further left can you possibly

1108
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,160
push

1109
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,680
than the user story

1110
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,400
that's where it begins it all starts at

1111
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,920
the user story so if we can push

1112
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,760
security practices left to the user

1113
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,800
story

1114
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,560
we've gone as far left as we could

1115
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,480
possibly imagine and that's exactly

1116
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,720
where we need to go so think about this

1117
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,480
if threat modeling is just simply asking

1118
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,560
what could possibly go wrong you do that

1119
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,560
every day

1120
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,119
every one of us does if you're my my

1121
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:45,119
favorite example is you live in the

1122
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,880
suburbs and you're going to go to the

1123
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,440
city for a show

1124
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,119
what are you going to think about you're

1125
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:53,599
going to probably think about well where

1126
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,280
am i going to find parking close enough

1127
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,520
to the show how much is it going to cost

1128
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,960
me

1129
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,119
what happens if the car has issues on

1130
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,480
the way down i get a flat tire or

1131
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,520
whatever

1132
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,280
is the area i'm going to and where i'm

1133
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,319
going to park well lit and safe

1134
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:10,240
what's the crime like in that area is

1135
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,560
this an okay place to go what time do i

1136
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,720
leave so i get there on time these are

1137
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,319
all threats you're threat modeling in

1138
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:17,680
your head and you're thinking about what

1139
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,839
am i going to do about that so we want

1140
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:23,040
our business people who write our user

1141
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,040
stories to do the same

1142
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,280
tell us what's important to you in this

1143
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,400
just the scope of this user story

1144
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,480
what critical assets are introduced or

1145
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,960
being modified is it personal

1146
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,280
information is it critical functions

1147
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,839
that need to be available at all times

1148
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:42,400
is is it you know financial assets or

1149
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,640
trade secrets and then tell us what the

1150
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,240
threats are is there a threat that they

1151
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,200
could be stolen so there's a threat of

1152
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,640
theft

1153
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,720
is there a possibility of fraud

1154
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,160
what are the key threats that you're

1155
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,240
worried about and just put it in plain

1156
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,640
language

1157
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,280
because now this feeds the rest of our

1158
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,200
pipeline and i'm going to show you how

1159
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,440
this starts to progress us toward making

1160
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,480
that pipeline faster and it shows our

1161
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,599
teams how security can make them faster

1162
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:13,520
and more efficient so i've got this

1163
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,680
threat information in my backlog it's in

1164
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,839
my user story i go and i pull that

1165
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:19,599
user's story maybe as part of sprint

1166
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,160
planning or i'm just a dev who is in a

1167
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,560
really really fast-paced ci cd and i

1168
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,720
just pull the next high priority item

1169
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,319
next highest priority item off of the

1170
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,160
backlog

1171
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,839
i look at that threat information either

1172
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:33,839
way and i can say i understand my

1173
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:36,240
security requirements because they've

1174
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,440
told me what's important here and

1175
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,359
they've told me the threats so now as i

1176
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,839
move into coding i can build security

1177
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:44,319
controls

1178
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:45,839
i can reference back if we're really

1179
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,920
mature i can reference back to reference

1180
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,480
architectures or design standards

1181
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,560
engineering standards those things that

1182
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,440
help

1183
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,680
our developers be more

1184
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,480
enabled to create these

1185
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,720
security controls but it doesn't stop

1186
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,560
there because i have this information

1187
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,240
and now i know what security controls

1188
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,319
i've prioritized and created well that

1189
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:08,560
can feed my test cases

1190
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,400
because now i know what's most important

1191
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,240
from a security perspective so i can

1192
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,480
feed that into my automated test cases

1193
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,560
and then because that information is

1194
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,280
there when i moved to deployment

1195
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,520
my sres my ops teams everybody was

1196
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,720
responsible

1197
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,040
for that piece of it they understand how

1198
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,359
to configure the monitoring to watch for

1199
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:30,720
those potential threats

1200
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,480
this is how threat modeling can fit in

1201
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,319
here and is how threat modeling can be

1202
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:39,359
used to make your pipeline faster

1203
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,680
reduce works in progress

1204
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,560
deploy quicker because security you're

1205
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,400
responsible for it so this is how you

1206
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,839
get there

1207
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:50,720
use threat modeling not only is it not

1208
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,720
incompatible

1209
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,960
it's necessary and it's a huge asset to

1210
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,960
you so let's start to

1211
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,480
let's do this

1212
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,400
now if you want to know more again go to

1213
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,800
my talk from yesterday

1214
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,040
see that talk pasta

1215
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,440
octave stride oh my

1216
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,040
and i'll give you more pointers in that

1217
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,720
one on how you do this

1218
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,640
last myth myth number five you guys

1219
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,880
almost made it we're almost there

1220
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,800
one more myth i need you security people

1221
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,280
to stop putting out there and that is

1222
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,280
this idea that we need to break down the

1223
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,880
silos in order to build devsecops

1224
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,839
culture

1225
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:32,000
silos exist for a reason

1226
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,160
because we need

1227
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,000
people who specialize in certain

1228
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,440
knowledge

1229
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,359
when i say shared responsibility that

1230
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:42,000
doesn't mean that i want my

1231
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,839
security people

1232
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:46,800
to be in there configuring databases

1233
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,800
configuring

1234
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,119
you know kubernetes clusters things of

1235
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:52,560
that nature

1236
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,520
i don't want my ops writing application

1237
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,839
code

1238
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,520
i want everybody to have an

1239
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,920
understanding and to do their part

1240
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,319
but we still want those expert those

1241
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:06,640
areas of expertise we don't want to

1242
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,440
break down silos we need to network

1243
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,400
those silos

1244
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,040
we want them to talk and work together

1245
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,560
productively

1246
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,200
build up scrum teams let's dive into

1247
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,560
that let's talk about this before i get

1248
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,119
ahead of myself

1249
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:26,160
building that empathy and culture

1250
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:30,240
is how we network these silos together

1251
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,000
empathy is one of the things that i

1252
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,240
think is so underrated i but i'm glad

1253
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,520
i'm hearing more and more people talk

1254
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,920
about the need for it in security we

1255
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,319
need it in devsecops

1256
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,000
because it's how we make all this work

1257
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,560
it's how we network across silos and

1258
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,960
make sure that instead of breaking down

1259
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,640
silos we make the silos work together

1260
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,680
in concert with each other

1261
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,520
one of the ways you can do this is this

1262
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,000
idea of walking a mile in their shoes

1263
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,240
job shadowing get dev and sec and ops

1264
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,760
spending time

1265
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,560
working in each other's roles and don't

1266
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,920
just use your junior devs don't just use

1267
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,800
your junior security analysts send the

1268
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,560
senior folks i know it's tough because

1269
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,920
they're very productive and you don't

1270
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,880
want to give up that productivity

1271
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,480
but they're the ones who will have the

1272
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,400
best perspective to bring that back to

1273
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,599
the team

1274
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:25,359
and this is all about building that

1275
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:27,920
empathy where now they understand what

1276
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,079
the people in security what the people

1277
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:32,400
in ops are dealing with as a result of

1278
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,040
what comes to them from the development

1279
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,960
side and now they can start to shape

1280
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,960
that they start interfacing with those

1281
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,200
people on a daily basis and it humanizes

1282
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:45,879
each other and now they interact better

1283
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,319
from a security perspective if we're

1284
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:49,920
going to talk about

1285
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,440
new processes new tools anything

1286
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,319
we have got to meet them where they live

1287
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:59,200
provide resources and tooling that fit

1288
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,760
in the pipeline

1289
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,160
this is knowledge this is processes this

1290
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,240
is tooling it's all of it make sure that

1291
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,400
if you're going to introduce a new piece

1292
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,800
of security tooling maybe you're

1293
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,000
launching a new sca platform or some new

1294
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,599
cloud security product

1295
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:21,760
how does that tie into their pipeline

1296
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,319
can it be automated

1297
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:27,040
can their build scripts automate that

1298
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:30,079
can the results be automated into new

1299
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:33,440
entries in the backlog

1300
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,640
how do we make this happen make sure

1301
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:39,920
everything

1302
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,119
plugs in

1303
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:42,960
to their existing tooling

1304
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:47,359
this is how we eliminate friction

1305
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,160
so

1306
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,280
while automation isn't

1307
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,079
the only part of devsecops it is still

1308
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:57,760
part of those five areas we talked about

1309
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,680
to building that culture so make sure

1310
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,760
you meet them where they live give them

1311
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,000
tools that are familiar to them things

1312
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,400
that plug into their ide so they don't

1313
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,400
have to learn a new way of doing their

1314
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,800
job they don't have to add additional

1315
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,040
complexity to the things that they're

1316
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:13,920
doing

1317
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,400
so that they can continue to improve the

1318
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,560
speed and reduce works in progress

1319
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:23,280
then it's about paving the road

1320
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,200
so as you're building this as you're

1321
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,760
looking at it in terms of tool selection

1322
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:28,800
you're throwing it out there you're

1323
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,440
enabling your developers now comes that

1324
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,559
idea of income of accountable trust

1325
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,800
how many of us deal with security teams

1326
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,280
who are overwhelmed with work we can't

1327
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,119
keep up with

1328
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:43,359
all of the demands of you know trying to

1329
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,880
review all the software that comes our

1330
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,599
way from our development teams

1331
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:50,079
make them accountable trust them to do

1332
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:52,000
the right thing trust them to see that

1333
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,079
if there is a better way

1334
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:57,119
they can accomplish the same objective

1335
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:58,880
in that other way

1336
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,440
and enable them to do that you trust

1337
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,280
them but you trust them because you've

1338
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,800
built a culture where they understand

1339
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,480
that they're accountable

1340
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,359
this takes time it takes effort and

1341
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:11,040
security still needs some level of

1342
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,759
oversight

1343
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,760
but at the end of the day this is how we

1344
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,839
get better because we can't keep up we

1345
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:20,160
don't have those unlimited budgets it

1346
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,800
just doesn't happen

1347
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,319
pave the road put the path make it so

1348
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:28,400
that the secure way to get there is the

1349
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,240
easiest way to get there

1350
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,800
but then if you're wrong enable them to

1351
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:37,280
change that path and pave their own road

1352
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,839
and then finally mutual engagement when

1353
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:42,720
we're talking about empathy this is huge

1354
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:45,119
how many of you invite your sres and

1355
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:47,440
your security team

1356
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,920
to your your scrums to your daily

1357
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,680
stand-ups

1358
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,119
to your sprint planning to your

1359
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,200
retrospectives

1360
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,800
do they come to your risk committee

1361
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,480
meetings your devs and your ops teams

1362
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,960
they should you should all be

1363
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,920
interacting on a daily basis

1364
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,760
when these daily activities include

1365
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:10,000
everybody this builds that idea of

1366
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,480
shared responsibility where everybody

1367
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,000
understands that while they bring their

1368
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
own expertise and perspectives they're

1369
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,160
ultimately all responsible for the same

1370
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,200
thing

1371
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,119
that's how you get to a devsecops

1372
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:23,599
culture you need to get everybody

1373
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:26,319
into that mode of we work together for

1374
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:28,240
the same objectives

1375
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,880
creating that mutual engagement drives

1376
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,520
that culture it builds that empathy and

1377
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,760
again it humanizes each other where we

1378
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,680
understand the challenges and we don't

1379
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,119
just make assumptions when we see

1380
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:40,319
something we don't like that it's

1381
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:43,520
because somebody was being lazy

1382
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,520
so it's just about time for me to wrap

1383
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:48,160
up here but as i usually do i want to

1384
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,599
leave you with a quote and this one

1385
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:51,200
comes from henry ford

1386
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,599
coming together is the beginning

1387
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:55,040
creating an organization of lots of

1388
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,319
different people

1389
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:58,599
keeping together is progress so

1390
00:49:58,599 --> 00:50:00,880
establishing those processes and things

1391
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,960
that we all work within

1392
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,559
but working

1393
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:05,920
together

1394
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,640
the shared responsibility is where we

1395
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,040
find success

1396
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:14,960
that is the key to devsecops that is the

1397
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,720
vision that patrick and andrew and gene

1398
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,160
and josh

1399
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,880
laid out for us so many years ago

1400
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,559
that we need to keep driving for

1401
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:26,559
security practitioners we need to

1402
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:29,359
understand how we

1403
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,160
insecurity

1404
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,559
need to be just as responsible

1405
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:36,160
as our developers

1406
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,559
and as our operations teams

1407
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:41,119
and we can make this work

1408
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:41,839
so

1409
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:43,920
did i get it wrong

1410
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,440
