00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,399
beginning of this

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,640
of the slides uh a lot of the pains that

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,399

as a subject matter expert for our indus

52
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,439
so let me explain why we're kind of

53
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,360
giving this talk so

54
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,800
the key thing is

55
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,400
we kind of want to just

56
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,080
tell you guys things we wish we kind of

57
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,680
knew before we even

58
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,480
came into an msp sock or kind of like

59
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,440
our experiences within east sagin itself

60
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,480
so because of that we're going to be

61
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,920
talking about the technical skills we

62
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,200
learned

63
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,040
we're going to discuss like we're going

64
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,720
to mention the practical skills that we

65
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,959
utilize in our day-to-day work

66
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,879
as well as also providing advice that

67
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,120
we've learned both from our experience

68
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,599
as well as any mentors that we may have

69
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,400
had within the sock or from just various

70
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,040
different cons

71
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,760
so

72
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,280
let me tell you a little bit about my

73
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,400
first week

74
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,760
into

75
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,440
msp stock life

76
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,000
so in my case i actually came in with no

77
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,519
knowledge of networking or network

78
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:58,959
security

79
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,480
if you think that's strange because i

80
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,319
said i have a master's degree in

81
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,720
computer information technology well my

82
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,800
focus was actually more on host

83
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,720
forensics or like

84
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,599
mobile forensics also so i really didn't

85
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,519
know networking when i got in so i was

86
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:14,879
actually kind of

87
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,400
extremely worried

88
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,280
since

89
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,680
that's primarily what the sock was

90
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,000
focusing on at that time

91
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,360
and so

92
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,440
i went in completely nervous like no

93
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,599
search to my name even

94
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,760
and just went in

95
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,040
knocked on the door

96
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,959
for my first day

97
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,920
got in uh sat down asked around saying

98
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,599
why i kind of need to learn what i need

99
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,560
to know

100
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,760
and so

101
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,680
after a bit like a tier two actually

102
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,599
like said hey let's go

103
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,400
on a walk and just chat a bit and so we

104
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,400
actually chat a bit he told me about his

105
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,360
experiences how he went from retail

106
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,720
into uh analyst work and just how he

107
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,959
managed to grow

108
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,480
eventually

109
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,799
like a manager also came

110
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,000
afterwards

111
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
after the walk and actually tapping on

112
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,200
the shoulder too and said hey let's go

113
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,680
for a walk and kind of did the same

114
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,239
thing and i'm it was primary to view

115
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,159
like how i am as a person as well as

116
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,000
like engage my personality and how i'd

117
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,760
fit into the sock

118
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,639
and so for the entire first week

119
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,959
i was shadowing people and learning just

120
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,880
basic networking information

121
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,080
and

122
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,120
i was worried like because networking

123
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,600
has quite a bit of moving parts to it so

124
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,919
i was worried that if i didn't know

125
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,040
everything

126
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,759
i would not necessarily be able to be

127
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,440
competent enough to actually continue

128
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,000
working there much longer

129
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,080
so i actually worked very hard to kind

130
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,080
of like pick up every what everyone was

131
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,199
doing

132
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,759
and so by the end of the first week

133
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,280
after i managed to get access to a lot

134
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,160
of our tools i began doing the very

135
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,080
basic work that they had

136
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,600
all right so for me i came into the sock

137
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,960
with around about 15 years uh pr prior

138
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,639
rt experience as being a system

139
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,840
administrator

140
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,280
and i had one year at the previous

141
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,639
position before

142
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,960
uh working at my current employer as

143
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,120
uh working with an internal auditor that

144
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,160
we had

145
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,240
for we were checking vulnerabilities on

146
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,000
a windows 10 build

147
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,520
and they were going to use that windows

148
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,720
10 build

149
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,000
for a unit of computers

150
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,800
for

151
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,800
several people to use when they were

152
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,039
accessing a state

153
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,759
state grant state

154
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,400
state financials federal financials so

155
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,720
they want the machines to be uh

156
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,720
as vulnerable as as less

157
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,639
vulnerabilities as possible

158
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,840
and as secure as secure as i can make

159
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,840
them and the internal auditor could make

160
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,240
them as well and got a chance to use

161
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,120
tenable and nessus and that was really

162
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,560
my first

163
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,600
i guess you can say foot step or step

164
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,560
into

165
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,240
the security

166
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,199
realm

167
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,759
and then i use that of course plus my

168
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,960
previous experience and my education to

169
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,039
apply for a job at my current employer

170
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:09,919
and

171
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,360
i got on and

172
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,919
i came into the soc my first week

173
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,800
actually when i came into my interview

174
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,400
for the position i had suit and tie on

175
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,319
i was a little nervous and

176
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,840
i noticed then the culture shift from

177
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,000
my previous position to working in a

178
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,800
sock where you're working sometimes

179
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,160
you're working eight hours a day

180
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,240
sometimes you work 10 hours a day it

181
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,400
just all depends so

182
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,759
being comfortable

183
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:38,880
and

184
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,520
you know not having the the worry of

185
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,160
having to wear a suit and tie or be

186
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,319
quote unquote business casual that was

187
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,240
one of the first things i noticed after

188
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,400
i was hired and i came my first day

189
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,639
so i sat in a conference room with two

190
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,960
other new hires one came from houston

191
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,080
texas

192
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,199
and one was an internal hire who came

193
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,520
from a previous division

194
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,960
over to the sock

195
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,199
and the person who was from houston

196
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,520
texas we were both going to be working

197
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,319
in the ics realm as well as

198
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,160
being a sock analyst so ari came in with

199
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,720
a dual role mentality which was

200
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,759
pretty cool

201
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,000
and got a chance to read over

202
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,319
a lot of material and a lot of security

203
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,360
information

204
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,840
uh because they wanted to make sure that

205
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,560
out of the different documentations and

206
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,039
platforms i was going to be reading and

207
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,199
using and seeing customer data and such

208
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,639
that the highly confidential

209
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,479
confidential data and such that i

210
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,840
understood everything that i was going

211
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,360
to be viewing i had to sign a lot of

212
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,880
different papers which was

213
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,360
uh not a problem and i took the same

214
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,560
walk as richard with my uh supervisor

215
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,720
and we went on a walk he wanted to talk

216
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,000
to me about

217
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,039
my uh current uh my current mindset

218
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,280
where i want to be where i want to go

219
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,160
uh any questions i had about the role

220
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,280
and he told me a little bit about

221
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,680
himself as well and how he got from

222
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,919
where he was before he came into

223
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,759
being a site manager to

224
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,680
to to that point and

225
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,960
it was a very

226
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,280
enlightening and a good conversation to

227
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,360
kind of take the stress off when you're

228
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,319
about to start you know in a sock where

229
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,520
it's uh close close quarters when you're

230
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,199
right next to someone

231
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,560
in in an operations control uh

232
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,599
operations control environment so

233
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,400
came in uh watched a lot of videos about

234
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,719
uh the different platforms i was using

235
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,240
the division itself

236
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,599
and the work that i would be doing in

237
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:36,719
general

238
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,080
and

239
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,719
when i left my first week i went down to

240
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,719
the stock and started working and

241
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,560
lo and behold the first

242
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,040
case case work that i started to do was

243
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,680
with wannacry and that was when

244
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,959
the big wannacry outbreak happened

245
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,800
over a lot of virtual customers and

246
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,680
that was pretty much a

247
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,440
i hate to say shocked but i was a bit

248
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,360
surprised that the outbreak was

249
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,080
happening over so many customers and

250
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,000
you're talking dozens of cases are

251
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,399
coming in like per hour if not if not

252
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,200
more

253
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,920
so

254
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,320
i got a chance after the first week to

255
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,640
really get my feet wet and to really

256
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,080
dive in to

257
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,040
uh want to cry and and and what do who

258
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,200
what where when uh why why things were

259
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,480
happening and

260
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,680
that was

261
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,560
pretty much my first weekend in some so

262
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,519
all right let's get to the stories

263
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,959
so

264
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,200
i would like to talk first about

265
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,080
a

266
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,920
case that i had and

267
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,519
as you can see the picture is not as uh

268
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,440
alluring as you may think but this was

269
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,320
about a pecan duck and a hidden malware

270
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,240
so you see this peking duck here nice

271
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,440
pretty picture

272
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,760
the pecan duck is nicely glazed and

273
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,760
coated it looks very nice on a on a

274
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,600
plate on the table well

275
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,560
i actually had a case that was uh

276
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,800
similar to what you're seeing and i'll

277
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,880
explain more

278
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,720
so i received the case from one of our

279
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,920
customers

280
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,959
and i did my analysis and the the

281
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,959
picture came in as a phishing email so

282
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,360
i was able to grab the document grab the

283
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,480
file and

284
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,320
pull the file down and

285
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,560
put it into one of our evaluation tools

286
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,160
and take a look at it and

287
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,880
the file was a picture of a peking duck

288
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,720
it was nicely glazed

289
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,680
uh

290
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,680
cooked well like it was

291
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,920
uh you know somebody was just taking a

292
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,279
really good picture

293
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,000
of a duck that they cooked and it was on

294
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,640
a dinner table so nothing at first

295
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,959
glance was like telling me

296
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,440
that this is a malicious file a

297
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,079
malicious picture this jpeg is something

298
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,160
i should be worried about as a tier one

299
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,120
analyst

300
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,000
so

301
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,440
i did some investigating because the

302
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,200
picture was very small

303
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,560
but the

304
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,079
size of the picture

305
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,279
itself was several gigabytes so i was

306
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,760
noticing that it's unusually large

307
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,480
for

308
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,560
just a picture of it's a small picture

309
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,880
of a peking duck

310
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,399
cooked so

311
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,320
i went ahead and did some more analysis

312
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,360
and

313
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,959
they're different the different

314
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,200
platforms and software's that we use in

315
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,760
the sock that's one of the the cool

316
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,240
aspects of working where i work and i

317
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,680
got a chance to put it in one of our

318
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,519
evaluation tools and

319
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,519
i gotta i had a

320
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,040
glimpse into

321
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,120
okay this picture

322
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,600
has an embedded filing following it let

323
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,200
me take a closer look at this embedded

324
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,600
file and see what it is

325
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,839
come to find out that that file was

326
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,640
uh once it was decoded that file was

327
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,519
actually a trojan virus so

328
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,000
i alerted my shift lead and my shift

329
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,320
play was like okay wow this is

330
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,680
pretty cool stuff

331
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,800
so

332
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,240
i didn't know

333
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,560
at that point what i had discovered

334
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,200
it was until later i did more research

335
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,839
that me just taking that time to put

336
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,480
forth that effort to really just

337
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,279
find out and evaluate what this file is

338
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,360
that this actually was

339
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,920
a steganography and

340
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,120
if you don't know the goal of

341
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,839
stereography is pretty much to

342
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,720
keep people or or people like myself or

343
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,880
others of thinking that

344
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,519
a picture or a file

345
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,680
is something that it's not so

346
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,240
it's more or less a practice of hiding a

347
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,600
secret message

348
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,440
inside of something that really isn't

349
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,480
secret

350
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,200
so

351
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,959
if you if you really think about it for

352
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:39,920
example

353
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,600
if you know you go fishing with your

354
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,680
buddies or you take a picture with a

355
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,920
picture of your uh two-year-old a

356
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,000
two-year-old birthday party and you take

357
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,120
a picture and you send that out to

358
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,079
people

359
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,680
somebody's gonna pretty much open it up

360
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,560
and

361
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,760
they're not going to think anything of

362
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,959
it but

363
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,120
if you're a threat actor or a hacker

364
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,279
and you're trying to do this to entice

365
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,519
someone or use social engineering

366
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,320
this could really be a big deal so

367
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,360
uh the picture fortunately

368
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,040
was uh one was not opened uh but in

369
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,519
stereography once the picture is open or

370
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,200
the file is opened

371
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,839
and that picture or file is executed it

372
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,560
could be macros and excel anything

373
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,040
that gives that file the execution

374
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,200
command to run that system could have

375
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,120
been very very bad but

376
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,880
luckily for me

377
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,200
that file is not run it's not it's not

378
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,320
executed

379
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,720
the customer is able to go into the

380
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,399
email and of the of the of the employee

381
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,480
and go ahead and delete that email and

382
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,320
nothing came up we

383
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,639
also have to survive the scare

384
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,880
so this is a picture here of

385
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,440
a software that can be used called quick

386
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,480
stego and as you see on the left

387
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,360
you have this lady who's dressed in

388
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,760
business casual suit her laptop she's

389
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,680
working hard if you got that picture you

390
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,360
wouldn't think anything of it but if you

391
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,440
weren't expecting it it's a good idea

392
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,560
just to label it a spam or just delete

393
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,920
it and don't even worry about trying to

394
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,399
open it and see wow what what is this

395
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,839
picture who's sending it who sent this

396
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,279
to me because

397
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,040
the good thing about this picture as you

398
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,959
see from this example

399
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,720
this picture was embedded with the

400
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,519
sonnets by william shakespeare so

401
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,680
someone in this example was trying to

402
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,360
send someone some

403
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,959
shakespeare

404
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,240
information

405
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,399
about the sonnets so

406
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,680
you can put

407
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,839
if you know how to embed

408
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,720
files and you know how to embed uh uh

409
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,519
even malicious files malicious code

410
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,519
you can really either send somebody

411
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,040
something in secret

412
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,199
so nobody will see it or

413
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,639
you can really send somebody something

414
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,440
that can really damage their computer or

415
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,000
the network they're working on

416
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,279
so

417
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,160
for me

418
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,160
the lessons that i learned from all this

419
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,279
being

420
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,279
pretty much i was about uh i would say

421
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,360
within a year into

422
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,600
about my role in the stock was

423
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,839
anytime you have any data or files that

424
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,360
you're not sure about

425
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,079
always use your security appliances your

426
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,720
platforms your whatever software that

427
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,720
your employee has or maybe you have

428
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,839
yourself

429
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,680
and just submit them into some type of

430
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,120
evaluation tool

431
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,279
uh whatever you may have mcafee norton

432
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,279
on your computers um just see if you can

433
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,279
run just a quick check just to see

434
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,000
if what you're seeing if what you have

435
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,279
on your computer is malicious or not so

436
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,600
very good thing to do and

437
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,199
it's always very easy when you're

438
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,040
looking at something like a picture of a

439
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,160
peking duck nicely glazed and looks like

440
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,920
it's just ready just to eat

441
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,920
as something that you know this actually

442
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,000
could be harmless i wasn't expecting

443
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,240
this picture i have no idea who this

444
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,240
person is sending it to me so it's a

445
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,880
good idea to do your due diligence as

446
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,279
i've always said before and i apologize

447
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,000
uh

448
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,199
presentation

449
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,720
it's always the good job to do your due

450
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,040
diligence when you're handling a file

451
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,079
picture

452
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,199
uh excel document anything of any sort

453
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,440
that you're not expecting and even

454
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,360
sometimes a few arcs maybe if you are

455
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,199
expecting it but it doesn't come through

456
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,639
the same way that or the exact way that

457
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,880
you thought it may come through to you

458
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,560
it's still a good job just to do some

459
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,000
due diligence just to reach out and say

460
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,720
hey

461
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,360
is this what you sent because you just

462
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,759
never know

463
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,519
all right

464
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:30,320
so

465
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,079
let's go into a

466
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,160
situation i've been in before which i

467
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,839
like to call fishing for answers

468
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,519
so just to go over quickly what phishing

469
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,399
is in case nobody like in case some new

470
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,320
people within cyber security are

471
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,320
attending this talk

472
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,040
by definition from merriam-webster

473
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,360
phishing is a scam by which an internet

474
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,519
user is duped into revealing personal or

475
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,600
confidential information

476
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,480
which the scammer can use illicitly

477
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,040
what this kind of means is

478
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,119
any information that can be used to kind

479
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,000
of break into a network such as

480
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,640
your username and password maybe your

481
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,400
security questions

482
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,799
maybe your two-factor authentication

483
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,160
code or even your banking credentials

484
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,799
like all these can be kind of gathered

485
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:21,839
from

486
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,319
phishing and so this is why attackers

487
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,000
may use phishing or harvested

488
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,679
credentials from previous phishing

489
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,039
campaigns

490
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,640
into brinking into a network because

491
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,559
why would you not want to just open up

492
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:35,679
the

493
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,200
door when you have the key for it

494
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,360
so

495
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,679
in this situation i've been in like it

496
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,600
was just a normal work day

497
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,679
i was working on the queue

498
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,240
uh my co-worker was working on an

499
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,160
incident from the customer

500
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,400
where they detected a successful

501
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,720
phishing attack where the user actually

502
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,559
put in their credentials

503
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,799
luckily that user actually reported to

504
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,880
their security team hey i think this is

505
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,720
a phishing attack

506
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,559
and so they sent to us to kind of

507
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,679
further investigate for it for them

508
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:12,640
and so

509
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,240
while my coworker was doing that i was

510
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,760
just working the normal queue and i

511
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,919
actually picked up a

512
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,520
instant not necessarily related to

513
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,000
phishing at the time but rather a person

514
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,559
clicking on an email link

515
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,960
when i looked further into it it was

516
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,640
a microsoft

517
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,799
it was a microsoft

518
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,200
phishing attack and so i actually went

519
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,559
further in i began looking at wsa or web

520
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,000
security appliances or http logs and

521
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,760
just gathering up as much information as

522
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,160
i can to see how far in the phishing

523
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,600
attack they went

524
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,200
and i saw that

525
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,640
they pretty much put in all the key

526
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,240
information they the attacker would need

527
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,840
to actually log on to the customer's

528
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,200
network and then i realized wait a

529
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,840
minute this is for the same customer

530
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,080
a successful phishing attack

531
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,720
let me verify with the my co-worker that

532
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,440
this is the same incident

533
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,600
and so i reached out to him and actually

534
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,120
chat with him about it

535
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,000
and it turns out that yeah it was the

536
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,760
same exact thing however he was actually

537
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,120
having issues

538
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,120
just trying to trail down

539
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,280
how the phishing attack occurred

540
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,679
because they just gave him the username

541
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:24,799
and so he

542
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,039
looked through dns logs over the past 24

543
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,679
hours that involved the user

544
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,080
and he was just scratching his head

545
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,039
going like

546
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,240
where is the phishing domain

547
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,400
and he actually broke it down into two

548
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,360
lists

549
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,799
one where

550
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,000
it's the raw like every single dns query

551
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,039
that they did

552
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,039
every single domain they went to

553
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,799
and then he had a filtered one where he

554
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,480
removed things that he considered false

555
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,240
positives

556
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,440
and so

557
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,280
going through the filtered

558
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,320
domain lists i i didn't see the domain

559
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,120
and so i asked him hey is is this really

560
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,400
all you had

561
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,559
and it's like no i had i had some benign

562
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,480
ones too if if she really carries a look

563
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,559
like go ahead look he showed me that

564
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,320
list and i actually saw it fairly

565
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,280
quickly

566
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,960
and the reason why he marked it has been

567
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,720
nine was actually because the fact that

568
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,720
it was a sharepoint domain which

569
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,440
because sharepoint is a cloud

570
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,159
environment created by microsoft

571
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,039
a lot of customers use sharepoint

572
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,400
and in fact

573
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,080
that's where phishing is actually

574
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,559
heading more towards where they're using

575
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,960
cloud environments or cloud servers in

576
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,320
order to host

577
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,480
phishing attacks so that way

578
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,799
it's unlikely to be blocked by

579
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,640
enterprises since

580
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,240
nearly everyone uses the cloud at this

581
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,760
point

582
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,039
and so

583
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,880
i worked with him about that

584
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,200
gathered all the information we needed

585
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,919
we actually found an additional user too

586
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,000
that the customer did not know about

587
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,039
that actually put in all their

588
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,720
credentials so

589
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,840
we then said hey this user also did this

590
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,240
the same exact thing and

591
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,080
the next day we come back in and we

592
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,440
actually got kudos from the customers

593
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,960
because they didn't know so they

594
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,159
actually did the

595
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:11,760
normal phishing procedure of like

596
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,919
resetting their password and like

597
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,360
ensuring that they have two-factor

598
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,479
authentication turned on

599
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,080
and so

600
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,440
in this case like

601
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,640
the lessons that can be learned from

602
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,799
this is like sometimes a second set of

603
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,360
eyes is necessary like

604
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,840
a person may get like tunnel vision and

605
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,960
view it has to be this information

606
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,760
or they may not have like necessary

607
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,960
knowledge

608
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,520
to like further continue further on like

609
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,200
in my case i

610
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,919
have about three years of like looking

611
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,320
through fishing domains or

612
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,240
phishing attacks and just

613
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,559
understanding how phishing attacks work

614
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:53,600
and

615
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,600
seeing what domains they go on

616
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,799
uh

617
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,120
usually how they're successful and so

618
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,280
for me i'm a lot more familiar with it

619
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,480
whereas

620
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,840
he did not necessarily have the

621
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,200
information so

622
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,280
in my case like this extra information

623
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,080
came in for use and additionally like i

624
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,280
had

625
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,080
a advantage over him in the fact that

626
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,919
mines actually came with the email link

627
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,679
whereas he did not necessarily have that

628
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,120
and

629
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,840
working off all that like as i mentioned

630
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,760
communication between teammates is

631
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,880
important and even key at times since

632
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,400
that means that

633
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,559
we can all pull together our information

634
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,200
and knowledge as well as help each other

635
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,080
change

636
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,000
our perspectives on what we're working

637
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,559
on at that moment

638
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,559
all right well

639
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,840
i want to talk a bit about a

640
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,360
case that i had and

641
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,200
as you title you see the importance of

642
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,960
firmware updates

643
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,120
uh just give you all a

644
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,120
little bit of insight into

645
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,159
what i experienced and a bit of what i

646
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,320
was able to find out and

647
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,080
learn from this particular event

648
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,760
so a case came into our sock and

649
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,480
the case was just one that we received a

650
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,360
lot

651
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,960
in general from

652
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,640
our ics customers in icsq about

653
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,919
a

654
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,400
system that was accessed but

655
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,240
within our internal notes for our

656
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,480
customers we have particular systems

657
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,840
that are

658
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,919
uh i guess you can say

659
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,640
are a key part or

660
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,880
integral systems important systems that

661
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,520
are within the infrastructure

662
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,760
of the particular company so

663
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,279
it was one that if we

664
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,520
saw access to this system

665
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,080
and we saw particular systems that were

666
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,200
internal

667
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,799
that we would know that

668
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,799
more than likely it's just someone that

669
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,880
the engineer is on site or an

670
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,400
administrator that's accessing those

671
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,600
systems nothing to worry about but in

672
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,240
this particular case this was a system

673
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,360
that actually had an unknown

674
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,559
uh unknown id associated with this

675
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,080
access and

676
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,320
with the platform that we're using we're

677
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,919
able to also

678
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,840
do some investigation into the ip

679
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,799
address

680
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,480
and the mac address from this system so

681
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,480
uh the case was assigned to

682
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,960
analysis first and i uh it was escalated

683
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,159
to me so

684
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,400
i received the case did my due diligence

685
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,600
my investigations into the case and

686
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,440
ended up finding out that there was

687
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,039
indeed someone

688
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,960
who was trying to access

689
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,360
a particular important part of the

690
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,400
company's input the company's uh system

691
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,320
infrastructure this this system was very

692
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,360
important

693
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,080
but the access was coming from outside

694
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,200
of the company's network uh outside

695
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,240
coming in external internal so okay uh

696
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,799
good good good good job uh

697
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,240
of finding that now let's go ahead and

698
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,279
do some more some more digging so

699
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,200
the the system the customer security

700
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,360
administrator or engineer on site

701
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,640
learned that the the the external

702
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,919
person actor was trying to access

703
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,039
a integral part of the or rig's

704
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,840
uh systems and that was the driller's

705
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,960
chair

706
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,440
now i wasn't familiar with what

707
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,520
a driller's trail was let alone its

708
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,679
importance at this time so

709
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,520
i was kind of at the point of okay well

710
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,679
drill this chair sounds important

711
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,480
let's let me do some just some some

712
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,360
information gathering on my own and

713
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,520
luckily there the the the the access was

714
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,720
trying to be made from the outside but

715
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,080
it was blocked there wasn't a full

716
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,440
uh full access wasn't granted but

717
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,799
the problem that we had here with the

718
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,000
system was

719
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,919
this is the system that i was told from

720
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,080
the customer that they cannot take

721
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,000
offline or take down or find any

722
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,240
downtime to update the firmware so

723
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,840
a lot of a lot of systems when you think

724
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,840
about ics systems

725
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,600
a lot of these systems they do use

726
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,760
legacy systems

727
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,480
some some not not all the systems that

728
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,679
are within a

729
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,200
ics company are all old or older uh

730
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,520
legacy system systems with legacy

731
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,240
software but this particular one was

732
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,039
so

733
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,240
the fear was that someone could access

734
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,360
the system that didn't have the proper

735
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,000
update supply from the supply patch

736
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,840
management done anything

737
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,640
and they could really do some damage so

738
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,960
this here is a picture

739
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,440
that i just uh showing you of

740
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,679
a typical driller's chair now this is

741
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,240
not the one that i'm referring to that

742
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,480
was with the customer that

743
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,679
i i i work with but as you see

744
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,159
driller's chair looks very sleek looks

745
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,000
almost like a gamer's chair with the two

746
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,440
joysticks and

747
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,360
the two consoles that uh control a lot

748
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,360
of different things so

749
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,120
when you think of a driller's chair this

750
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,360
is a typical driller's chair

751
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,960
that uh

752
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:12,080
the the ics uh or rig companies have

753
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:12,960
so

754
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,919
i

755
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,000
fi i just came up with a definition just

756
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,159
to let you know what a driller's shirt

757
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,960
is and the drillers sit in a specially

758
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,480
designed chair

759
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,559
as you saw with the joysticks to control

760
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,799
drilling and pipe manipulation so

761
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:27,919
drilling

762
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,399
and pipe manipulation so think about

763
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,760
that if a attacker or

764
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,600
some type of threat or a hacker was able

765
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,480
to

766
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,520
get into one of these systems

767
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,600
they could possibly

768
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,200
i'm not going to say go as far as

769
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,240
control

770
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,159
the drilling and

771
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:47,039
the

772
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,279
the the whales that may be uh drilled

773
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,799
into but

774
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,120
there could there could be some damage

775
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,279
and the touch screens as you saw the

776
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,320
screens

777
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,200
they they allow for different automation

778
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,799
of the logging and

779
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,919
they keep records data interpretation

780
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,080
it's a lot of things that

781
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,440
the drillers chair controls so

782
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,559
when i when i say firmware updates and

783
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,640
updating systems

784
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,960
a lot of times as i told you it's hard

785
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,520
for customers to be able to take their

786
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,840
uh critical systems down

787
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,720
so

788
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,399
what we had to do pretty much was come

789
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,720
up with a downtime

790
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,559
a pacific time

791
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,840
quarterly or whenever the customer could

792
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,720
could do it to take the system down

793
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,480
and to apply

794
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,720
the necessary updates so

795
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,200
if there was another

796
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,120
another type of

797
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,520
trial or breach that was possibly about

798
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,200
to happen that we could at least make

799
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,360
sure this system was secure

800
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,600
that was the goal from that point on so

801
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,600
one thing that uh

802
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,399
i've been lucky to to have my get my

803
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,080
hands into is

804
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,880
the platform that we use was very good

805
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,360
with showing the alert and

806
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,000
the unknown id and

807
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,600
giving us the information that we could

808
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,279
use to perform

809
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,640
a investigation on this issue

810
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,159
and

811
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,799
because hackers themselves and anyone

812
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,720
trying to access these systems and you

813
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,480
see on the news with

814
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,559
these uh ransomware attacks that are

815
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:25,760
happening

816
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,520
all throughout the globe

817
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,480
it's just so much money that can be lost

818
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,120
it's some you talk about downtime yeah

819
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,720
uh if this that system were to have been

820
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,799
accessed somehow

821
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,640
that the downtime is going to be

822
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,799
very very uh it's going to be some some

823
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,159
maximum downtime there's going to be

824
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,600
some issues so

825
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,240
it's it it's one thing when

826
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,159
you think about the ics systems or

827
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,480
systems in general but for me being in a

828
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,360
sock i had a chance to actually

829
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,200
be you know

830
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,520
in the in the meetings and be with the

831
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,080
uh some of my uh peers and managers to

832
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,279
see

833
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,080
how how actors threat actors target one

834
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,520
of those systems how they target systems

835
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,279
how they scan how they

836
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,760
uh do have different techniques that

837
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,960
they use and

838
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,559
how for us

839
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,200
we use our different malware techniques

840
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,520
and and malware detection techniques and

841
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,799
the customer you know uses their uh

842
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,480
techniques as well to make sure these

843
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,840
systems are updated and secure so

844
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,799
for for for me with this case which was

845
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,000
a doozy

846
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,440
and i learned a lot from it it was it

847
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,640
was a

848
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,279
a very insightful case was

849
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,520
always make sure that your systems or

850
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,679
any systems are up to date with the most

851
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:44,880
recent firmware updates very very

852
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,840
important

853
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,480
and also because of this it was good to

854
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,039
see the customer take seriously

855
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,039
uh the preventive maintenance that

856
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:55,600
needed to be done and to also start to

857
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,799
schedule

858
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,919
downtime for critical systems

859
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:00,799
and

860
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,399
if possible

861
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:03,840
if this system were to have been

862
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,279
affected

863
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,039
the one thing that would have taken the

864
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,080
customer

865
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,399
uh down even with more downtime would

866
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,399
have been having to take that system off

867
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:13,440
the line

868
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,600
because anytime you have a malicious

869
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,360
connection of any type

870
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,200
it's it's really a good idea just to

871
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,039
pull that system offline

872
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,679
get it get it scanned get it cleaned up

873
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,360
uh replace the necessary parts if you

874
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,440
have to a hard drive or whatever and get

875
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,519
it back online as fast as you can

876
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,080
some customers can afford a downtime

877
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,080
still a good idea do the preventative

878
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,360
maintenance and you won't have that

879
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,719
issue happen in the future

880
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,679
all right

881
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,080
and now let us talk about the last

882
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,360
situation

883
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,640
in this uh

884
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,880
talk which is java the false positive

885
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,880
so just to make note

886
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,880
i was not the one who worked on this

887
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,120
instance however i heard about it and

888
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,039
actually investigated further in order

889
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,039
to actually determine

890
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,519
what how we can mitigate this issue in

891
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,600
the future

892
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,760
just because one of my biggest things is

893
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,559
you can always learn from mistakes

894
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,120
and improve upon them

895
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,000
and so in this case

896
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,960
we actually had a incident come in

897
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,720
for a zip file

898
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,000
and there were

899
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,080
a large amount of alerts generated for

900
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,480
it because the fact that it was seen on

901
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,559
hundreds of hosts

902
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,399
and so and anas

903
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:33,440
kind of

904
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,679
kind of investigated it and

905
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,080
looked into it and determined that it

906
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,159
was malicious

907
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,840
so because that he reached out to

908
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,840
the threat intel team about any new

909
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,240
campaigns involving the malware family

910
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,840
which was a

911
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,240
remote access trojan or

912
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,399
remote administrator tool depending on

913
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:55,600
how you want to

914
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,960
define it

915
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,360
but pretty much it's a tool it was a

916
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,080
malware that lets an attacker

917
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,120
access a host remotely

918
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,679
and so he believed it was that

919
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,399
and posted an associated file

920
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:11,919
of the zip file

921
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,600
within

922
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,399
the

923
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:17,360
within our team chat

924
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,279
and so the third intel team actually

925
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,200
researched into it and analyzed the file

926
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,399
and said like

927
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:25,679
the file he mentioned is malicious

928
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:28,960
like it is 100 it was 100 related with

929
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,519
the rats however

930
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,200
they looked further into it and saw that

931
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,880
the case he was working on

932
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,760
was benign the zip file was not related

933
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,440
to malware at all

934
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,799
however

935
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,159
the analyst insisted that it was

936
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:43,679
malicious and that

937
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,440
the intel team was wrong and that

938
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,919
actually caused an argument within

939
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,080
the team chat in fact it got bad enough

940
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,080
to where other analysts were actually

941
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,240
starting with the third intel team and

942
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,880
he was arguing against them too so it

943
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,080
was

944
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,039
getting pretty heated

945
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,360
and so what ended up happening was the

946
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,480
analyst

947
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,359
grabbed all the instance related to it

948
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:12,639
and sent it to the customer as a p2

949
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,040
now what that means is it was a priority

950
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,079
two case so it was a high priority case

951
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:20,000
for the customer to look into and work

952
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,079
on

953
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,879
when it's a p2 for us we actually call

954
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,560
and email the customer in order to

955
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,560
inform inform them that

956
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,320
hey this is very important you guys need

957
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,839
to look into this as fast as

958
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:36,159
possible and since the customer knows

959
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,679
how severe a priority 2 is

960
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,040
they actually began

961
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,079
getting worried and began asking us for

962
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:45,520
a lot more hunts

963
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,079
looking for potential compromises

964
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:51,119
uh command line arguments related to the

965
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,239
malware

966
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,440
and

967
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,119
we weren't finding anything

968
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,239
like

969
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,680
and in the end

970
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,520
what ended up happening was the customer

971
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,920
came back i'd say about a day or two

972
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,880
later

973
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,440
after we finished the hunt and they said

974
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,240
hey

975
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,920
it's benign

976
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,960
it was a part of a java update

977
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,240
don't worry about it and they resolved

978
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,280
the ticket

979
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,240
so

980
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,160
out of curiosity i talked to the last

981
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,480
analyst that worked on the incident and

982
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,920
he told me that

983
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,839
while he was trying with the customer

984
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,440
the customer said that they blocked it

985
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,800
and quarantined the file on their test

986
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,079
environment

987
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,320
and what ended up happening was it

988
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,119
crashed multiple servers within their

989
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:32,480
test environment

990
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,480
because of how important the

991
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,000
java is to their network

992
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:41,599
and so some of the lessons you can learn

993
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:42,960
from this

994
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,800
i even i've i've even learned from this

995
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,680
is that sometimes you don't

996
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,040
you can't always trust your security

997
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,160
vendors like they're not going to be

998
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,079
always correct you may need to do

999
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,079
further research yourself

1000
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:57,040
analyze

1001
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,480
if your tools are correctly detecting

1002
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,079
malicious activity

1003
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:03,040
and

1004
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,160
pretty much

1005
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,280
just use your experience

1006
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,440
so you also want to try and trust the

1007
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,040
judgment of your threat until team when

1008
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,640
they give you like enough supporting

1009
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,079
evidence to

1010
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,000
say hey this is benign or hey this is

1011
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,119
malicious

1012
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,640
because remember

1013
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,960
that that's their job like they've

1014
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,359
they usually research into

1015
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:24,960
similar threats

1016
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,400
so they have

1017
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,079
a good amount of knowledge on that

1018
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,079
aspect

1019
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:31,119
and

1020
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,280
as a kudos to the customer

1021
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,119
i am very happy that they had a separate

1022
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,680
test environment which is why

1023
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,200
i view that's always great to have a

1024
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,440
test environment when it's possible

1025
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,040
as you don't necessarily want your

1026
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,880
production environment to be your test

1027
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,480
environment since

1028
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,320
in this case

1029
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,920
if they did push it to their production

1030
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,400
it would have perhaps their network

1031
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,200
and

1032
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,040
that would have been terrible for

1033
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,119
business

1034
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,720
and

1035
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,560
another thing to learn is actually how

1036
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,200
to backtrack statements well

1037
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,440
because as i said before some of the

1038
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,599
analysts disagree that it wasn't that it

1039
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,400
was benign it wasn't malicious

1040
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,119
and so when they were working that case

1041
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,200
they kind of tried to change it from the

1042
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,680
perspective of being malicious to being

1043
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,440
suspicious

1044
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,720
so

1045
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,720
that's where it's very important to

1046
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,640
learn this skill and

1047
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,880
the final lesson is to understand that

1048
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,400
everyone one makes mistakes

1049
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,520
and so

1050
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,960
one of the important things is to

1051
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,640
understand that

1052
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,960
mistakes happen like the biggest thing

1053
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,119
is to kind of learn from them and move

1054
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:43,760
on because we're human

1055
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,079
we're expect to be

1056
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,720
accurate almost 100 of the time but

1057
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,560
we're not going to be

1058
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,599
and so

1059
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,119
that's where it's important to kind of

1060
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,400
say hey

1061
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,640
this is what i did wrong

1062
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,359
so next time i'll try and not do that or

1063
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,680
hey i see this person did this and it

1064
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,760
got them the wrong information i'll try

1065
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,720
this

1066
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,839
and just

1067
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:09,200
try and improve from mistakes and

1068
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,680
then use them as a stepping stone to

1069
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,240
move on

1070
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,440
all right all right so to summarize our

1071
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,240
experiences uh first thing i want to say

1072
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,040
is

1073
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,520
i'm not sure if you all notice but i'm

1074
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,560
going to tell you

1075
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,800
working in a sock is a

1076
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,079
very very

1077
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:31,119
unique

1078
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,599
experience and i say this because

1079
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,720
when you're in school or you're taking

1080
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,720
uh you know classes for a certification

1081
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,560
and such reading about uh stereography

1082
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,440
or about these different uh my malware

1083
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,760
families or threat types it's something

1084
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,680
to read about it but it's actually

1085
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,280
another thing to be

1086
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,760
in an environment that you can actually

1087
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,480
have hands-on experience working with

1088
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,800
these type of uh cases with these type

1089
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,839
of uh events that may come in uh seeing

1090
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,000
it firsthand and

1091
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,920
the soccer is a 24 7 365 day

1092
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,280
uh journey i'd like to say because

1093
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,359
this is going to be

1094
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:15,359
a dull moment it's always going to be

1095
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:16,560
some type of

1096
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,000
find or

1097
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
something's going to happen uh

1098
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,160
and it's one of those things where you

1099
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,040
as an analyst or an investigator even a

1100
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,839
manager you get a chance to really have

1101
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:30,640
that experience to intuit to see

1102
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,880
how these different type of

1103
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,599
uh things work as far as things that you

1104
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:36,960
research you read about you went to

1105
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,359
school about uh in for security for

1106
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:41,040
information technology

1107
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,359
it's like i guess you can say any other

1108
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:44,800
job but

1109
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,000
i've i've really had a dull moment in

1110
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,359
the sock and

1111
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:50,960
for me starting out

1112
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,520
as a tier one when i had minimal

1113
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,560
security knowledge and and now i'm i'm

1114
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,599
in uh our uh mdr uh division

1115
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:02,720
uh i've i've been very uh uh blessed and

1116
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,079
lucky to

1117
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,160
be able to experience and see a lot of

1118
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,280
things that

1119
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,640
uh i've only read about and the the

1120
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,040
recent i said the recent ransomware

1121
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,440
attacks that uh happen uh

1122
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,079
different companies you know i work in

1123
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:21,119
the ics division a subject matter expert

1124
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:25,119
with uh one of our customers and just

1125
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,960
having that outside knowledge being able

1126
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,480
to apply it to oh yeah well actually

1127
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,520
i've actually

1128
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,160
worked in this space and i've actually

1129
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,920
actually worked with

1130
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,119
a possible driller chair infection

1131
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:39,040
or having a

1132
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,000
having a

1133
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,720
outsider send a customer

1134
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,880
a customer employee

1135
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,000
a

1136
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,040
picture when the picture had a trojan

1137
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,480
virus embedded in the file actually uh

1138
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,560
worked with that to have that experience

1139
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,079
is invaluable

1140
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:56,880
so

1141
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,640
i want to say that richard uh you have

1142
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,960
anything you want to add

1143
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,960
i mean

1144
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,480
i do agree that

1145
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,599
mspsoc is a great way to learn a great

1146
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,680
environment to learn in all honesty

1147
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,680
because all these stories that we talk

1148
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,359
about they they're from different

1149
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:14,720
customers

1150
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,560
so it gives you a good idea on

1151
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,800
different networks

1152
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,359
like different procedures

1153
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:25,200
and just

1154
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,520
different logs to work with

1155
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,599
and so it tested your ability as an

1156
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:31,680
analyst and allows you to

1157
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,560
improve just off of

1158
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,839
environments being different and what

1159
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:38,319
information they provide you

1160
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:41,040
and so i do understand like why some

1161
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,200
people would like to stay in the stock

1162
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,040
for a long period of time

1163
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,400
so

1164
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,560
personally like

1165
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,000
i i could not continue to do it but it's

1166
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,119
honestly

1167
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,839
it was critical to my experience in

1168
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:57,839
security

1169
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:00,160
that's right i understand 100

1170
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,040
so

1171
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,440
uh if you i have any questions uh feel

1172
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,079
free to reach out uh to us on twitter or

1173
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:08,000
message us in discord

1174
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,400
uh if you have if you think of anything

1175
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,319
uh after the fact and uh i'd like to say

1176
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:17,440
thank you all uh for tuning in and thank

1177
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,839
you for your time
