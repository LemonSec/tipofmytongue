1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:01,760
[Music]

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,240
oh

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:23,488
[Music]

4
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,599
on the right at least my right

5
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,959
it is

6
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,599
with this uh typewriter device

7
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,480
now one reason that's interesting to me

8
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,280
is uh so much of what we do these days

9
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,120
is uh

10
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,599
fundamentally predicated on math and a

11
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,280
lot of the math is fundamentally

12
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,319
predicated on

13
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,720
are we online we're good we got audio we

14
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,200
got video

15
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,519
well thank you everyone for uh for

16
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,440
joining this talk is between the chair

17
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,480
and the keyboard

18
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,720
i was just vamping as they got the audio

19
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,959
worked out so if you did not hear the

20
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,319
end of that story and only caught the

21
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,480
beginning of it uh catch up with me at

22
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,840
some point in time and i'll explain to

23
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,159
you why this picture specifically the

24
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,280
device in the right uh underlies our

25
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,959
understanding of chaos theory which of

26
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,920
course led to nonlinear uh math which of

27
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,920
course led to cryptocurrencies bitcoin

28
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,159
and the end of the world i'll start

29
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,519
right there

30
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,120
the other thing

31
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,920
that of course all started

32
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,720
uh

33
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,040
way back when

34
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,918
was um was this idea that the problem is

35
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:22,960
between

36
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,320
the chair and the keyboard and that's

37
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,600
what we're going to to explore today

38
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,199
my name is wolfgang gorlick i am an

39
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,759
advisory ciso

40
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,800
uh and you know i think a lot about

41
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,280
strategy i think a lot about

42
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,400
how we go ahead and do

43
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,840
the uh

44
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,080
the the communications to users the

45
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,639
designs for developers how we get

46
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:49,919
security

47
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,600
thoughts out there and it is of course

48
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,759
incredibly important because as we know

49
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,639
from the verizon data breach report uh

50
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,080
humans

51
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,960
are at issue right 85 percent according

52
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,320
to the 201 report 85 percent of breaches

53
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,759
involve the human element i saw that

54
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:06,880
number

55
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,800
and it reminded me of something

56
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,880
it reminded me

57
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,840
of uh of a book i read a book called

58
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,680
design of everyday things i've talked

59
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,160
about this before at circle city count

60
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,400
on the circle city con stage and there's

61
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,960
this lovely line in the book

62
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,880
where they say that most industrial

63
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,039
accidents are caused

64
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,919
by human error right by by the people um

65
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,160
and the estimates range from 75 to 95

66
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,800
percent and the question that poses how

67
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,160
how is it how

68
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,039
so many people can be incompetent and as

69
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,960
those are reading this i'm like yes yes

70
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,400
because these are similar numbers we see

71
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,120
in infosec all the time yes so i'm

72
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,639
flipping the page i'm like tell me down

73
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,840
norman what's the answer

74
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,840
and another page was they're not

75
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,880
it's a design problem

76
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,120
it sounds like don't tell me it's me man

77
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,120
don't tell me it's me i first shared

78
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,000
this story uh at circle city con in a

79
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
talk called wibbly wobbly which was

80
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,199
designing security systems and uh and

81
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,400
that

82
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,919
that

83
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,759
question that question had me thinking

84
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,880
does does

85
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,720
infosec have a design problem this was

86
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,759
the question i posed uh at circle city

87
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,360
counter with do we have a design problem

88
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,520
and of course i think the unanimous

89
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,720
answer was yes i need our tools are to

90
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,680
use our users are frustrated and we've

91
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,360
got a number of breaches

92
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,680
now this is problematic for me

93
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,960
personally because i like to think of

94
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,440
myself like i fight for the user right

95
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,440
uh you know way back to war games way

96
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,759
back to tron i like to think of myself

97
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,720
in that vein but am i am i really doing

98
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,800
doing a good job

99
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,039
so this talk explores some of the

100
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,800
science behind that explore some of my

101
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,319
current thinking brings us all up to

102
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,160
date with where i'm at and it really

103
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,639
fits within the pantheon of the wider

104
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,919
talks on

105
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,039
uh security awareness sort of

106
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,360
because if you go to any conferences

107
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,720
you're going to hear things like oh

108
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,199
let's fish our end users for uh for fun

109
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,680
and profit uh let's talk about how dumb

110
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,240
dave is that the comic dave not you dave

111
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,599
if you're dave or listen to this i'm not

112
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,440
talking about you dave talking about

113
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,599
that comic where it's like on this end

114
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,440
is dave all right

115
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,120
our users are the weakest link right and

116
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,639
then we got all these terrible talks and

117
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,240
they all start the same way

118
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,319
it's not if but when

119
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,880
um there's been a three billion breaches

120
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,080
and counting everything is on fire

121
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,280
i don't know about you but i'm kind of

122
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,039
sick of those right i'm sick of those

123
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,319
because if it is in fact a design

124
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,639
problem we're facing we really need a

125
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,560
better design model and we need a better

126
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,039
design model that we can hang research

127
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,879
off that we can debate that we can run

128
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,520
hypotheses or create hypotheses

129
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,520
and run experiments within our

130
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,440
environment to see if it actually makes

131
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,639
sense

132
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:00,160
so i don't know that uh that this is

133
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,240
a good approach just talk about how the

134
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,000
world's on fire

135
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,759
no when i started thinking about this i

136
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,440
realized that i needed a better model

137
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,400
and let's start with that model and then

138
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,240
let's talk a little bit about applying

139
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,879
it to the human condition

140
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,960
and i'll give you some some ideas and

141
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,479
some research on how you can use these

142
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,039
ideas and uh and then we'll go from

143
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,720
there

144
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,680
now

145
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,919
the uh the first thing we think about a

146
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,639
model is it has to

147
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,120
be a way that we can rethink hardening

148
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,200
the human attack surface

149
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,000
and in part i believe that hardening

150
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,760
begins whether you're talking about

151
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,679
patching a server whether you're talking

152
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,440
about writing a line of code whether

153
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,880
you're talking about reconfiguring how

154
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,200
you're doing oauth and odc or saml which

155
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,800
is another one of my passion spots at

156
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,000
the moment

157
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,560
hardening always begins

158
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,720
with understanding understanding the

159
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,959
systems that we're looking at

160
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,240
uh

161
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,640
so do we have a good understanding of

162
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,920
our workforce that we're trying to

163
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,360
protect

164
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,920
i don't know that we do

165
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,920
so here's the the model i've been using

166
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,880
to

167
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,760
create that understanding it begins with

168
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,480
the path that they're taking

169
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,399
as they work through their

170
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,640
their environment as they go about their

171
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,720
day job we'll give a couple examples

172
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,240
here in a minute and then it looks at

173
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,240
the choices that they're making to to

174
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,240
get work done and we start thinking

175
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,760
through those paths that we're putting

176
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,279
them through and we start thinking

177
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,959
through the choices that they're making

178
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,440
and we can explore those properties and

179
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,440
manipulate some of those things some of

180
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,880
the main properties are the the number

181
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,480
of steps that they're taking along that

182
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,360
path

183
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,080
um the familiarity of each step uh do i

184
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,399
have it done this before

185
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,920
is it recognizable or is it unfamiliar

186
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,600
is it

187
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,920
got muscle memory in it

188
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,640
what's the friction age step is it easy

189
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,240
to complete this process or is it

190
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,360
difficult

191
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,240
um

192
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,120
in terms of choices we've got a similar

193
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,480
outline the number of choices the

194
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,399
predictability of each choice

195
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,399
and the cognitive load now we can really

196
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,279
screw up security by adding unnecessary

197
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,240
friction

198
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,560
uh i'm sure you can think of examples

199
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,240
where you've done that right where we we

200
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,480
ask them to jump through too many hoops

201
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,560
this is an area of friction by the way

202
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,680
is an area where

203
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,000
uh especially in like e-commerce

204
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,240
security when i'm called to advise on

205
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,880
that is an area we focus in on a lot

206
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,480
because if there's too much friction

207
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,240
signing up if there's too much friction

208
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,320
purchasing if there's too much friction

209
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,360
uh you know getting in to add a credit

210
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,880
card or change your car there's too much

211
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,320
friction there

212
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,839
consumers are going to go away and

213
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,320
that's going to have a very real world

214
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,320
uh impact on our on our bottom line

215
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,839
right

216
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,160
so how how do you

217
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,320
adapt and change in that regard i'll

218
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,000
give you one example

219
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,720
uh in the healthcare space maybe we make

220
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,440
it really easy to sign up maybe we make

221
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,200
it really easy even support social

222
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,640
logins

223
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,680
to to

224
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,800
register and to do those things uh maybe

225
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,120
we only inject the friction

226
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,040
when they're doing something risky so

227
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,360
i've registered i've signed up i've used

228
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,440
my gmail account it's nice and easy it's

229
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,760
familiar right i know how to use gmail

230
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,720
in the back end we're doing a whole

231
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,760
bunch of oidc stuff awesome

232
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,399
and uh and now i the user go to request

233
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,040
my logs at that point in time my my

234
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,240
patient history right the stuff you'd

235
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,360
want to steal right the stuff that

236
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,800
criminals are going to be uh

237
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,120
incentivized to pretend to be me to get

238
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,360
at at that point in time maybe that's

239
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,600
where we run through id proofing

240
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,200
especially it's the first time that i've

241
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,720
requested logs

242
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,120
and really make sure that it is in fact

243
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,240
me

244
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,120
uh

245
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,200
similarly we see that on

246
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,440
e-commerce sites with like step up

247
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,760
authentication when i go to change my

248
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,120
address

249
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,959
why well because if i'm a criminal i'm

250
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:57,920
gonna buy a whole bunch of stuff with

251
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,040
your card shipped to my address so maybe

252
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,720
maybe we'll add a little friction at

253
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,240
those points

254
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,399
but do everything we can to reduce

255
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,320
elsewhere you can get that's just one

256
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,600
point right that's just friction but you

257
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,880
can get the idea of how we can layer

258
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,160
these things on

259
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,920
to make smarter design decisions

260
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,440
i've been collecting a bunch of research

261
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,800
on this so you can

262
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,630
hit the the

263
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,880
[Music]

264
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,880
qr code if you're so inclined if you

265
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,560
don't trust me you can type it in if you

266
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,480
don't care don't worry about it i think

267
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,680
collecting a number of pages

268
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,760
in scientific studies that look at each

269
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,519
one of these steps so that we can make

270
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,040
some better informed decisions

271
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,200
there's been some interesting things for

272
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,279
example too little friction

273
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,959
and uh

274
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,279
and users don't think it's secure either

275
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,920
so it's it's not zero friction again

276
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,399
just picking on friction for example

277
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,399
all right let's talk about the paths

278
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,680
they take in the choices they make i

279
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,120
want to give you an example a very

280
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,000
simple example very common example

281
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,519
and it's an important example because

282
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,000
when we say 85 of all breaches are

283
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,760
caused by the human element and we peel

284
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,839
that out a significant number of those

285
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,279
are caused by

286
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,760
falling prey to phishing emails so you

287
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,360
can imagine we're going to map this out

288
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,279
right the person's going to want to get

289
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,560
into outlook and when they do they're

290
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,399
going to get prompted to log in and do

291
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,480
username and password so right now we

292
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,399
can apply some things like is it a

293
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,320
unique username and password

294
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,800
um is uh is it something they're

295
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,560
prompted for all the time or can they

296
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,800
save that uh or only be prompted every

297
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,079
few hours

298
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,440
we're gonna then prompt them for

299
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,200
multi-factor again we can think through

300
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,040
this is it a

301
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,040
common multi-factor do we have everyone

302
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,519
using the same multi-factor

303
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,639
uh

304
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,519
you know platform or is it multiple that

305
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,519
is important because i got to tell you

306
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,519
i've gotten to build some really good

307
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,199
muscle memory uh on my mfa for push i

308
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,519
bet you i could uh do a push request

309
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,279
while talking and not even know i did it

310
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,560
right my hand just goes there at this

311
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,519
point

312
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,519
in past organizations i had like four

313
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,040
different providers and codes and

314
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,959
everything else so we can start thinking

315
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,639
through that set of things now they're

316
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,079
going to get in they can browse their

317
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,360
email

318
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,120
not much we can do about that if anyone

319
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,720
knows how to cut down the amount of

320
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,399
email love to hear it

321
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,519
and then they're going to get fish right

322
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,399
this is what we're trying to prevent

323
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,839
they're going to get fished there's

324
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,040
going to be one email in there that

325
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,800
they're going to fall for

326
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,040
and at that point in time we want to

327
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,639
have them report it so that we can go

328
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,959
ahead and do an investigation

329
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,040
all along this process there's a number

330
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,480
of steps that they're taking there's a

331
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,000
number of decisions they're taking and

332
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
we can optimize any one of these steps

333
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,600
if we're trying to actually cut down

334
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,000
phishing can we prevent the phishing

335
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,920
email from getting into the inbox can we

336
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,240
make it easier for them to report

337
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,920
can we have better authentication

338
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,000
mechanisms so if they do get phished

339
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,519
those credentials are worthless to the

340
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,800
adversary

341
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,639
we can do this by mapping out what

342
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,680
they're doing

343
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,240
using some of the ui ux processes we can

344
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,839
do a journey map we can do a behavior

345
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,560
map if we want uh if it's this is a

346
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,800
pretty simple process but if it's a

347
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,240
process where people are getting lost

348
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,240
even knowing what to do

349
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,480
we can do way finding

350
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,720
there's a really interesting

351
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,519
uh research experiment that i i was

352
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,240
looking at and i loved it they walked

353
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,000
people through performing security

354
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,320
behaviors did it again and again people

355
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,399
could figure it out everything was fine

356
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,680
and then the researcher asked the

357
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,959
question like wait a minute we're

358
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,800
starting

359
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,959
you know in a couple steps into the

360
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,800
process we're already getting them into

361
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,160
outlook we're already getting them into

362
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,600
this process to make sure they knew what

363
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,880
to do next

364
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,120
uh what happens if we don't start them

365
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,800
there what happens if we just start them

366
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,160
at the desktop and ask where do you

367
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,959
think that will go and the success rate

368
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,519
went from around 80 to 90 percent down

369
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,279
to about 10 because everyone's like i

370
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,519
don't know do i go to settings do i do i

371
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,839
go to your website do i know i knew

372
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,480
where to even start and that just that

373
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,800
little question where where do i begin

374
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,720
uh which is a wayfinding question right

375
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,519
how do i find my way on this path uh was

376
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,720
enough to illustrate and identify where

377
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,120
some of the problems were in the uh in

378
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,440
the reporting process

379
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,959
all right what else can we do with this

380
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,160
path now that we've done a journey map

381
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,759
or behavior map or did a wayfinding

382
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,920
thing uh or did something process

383
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,320
analysis which you would do as part of

384
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,800
bcp drp right your business backed

385
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,360
analysis or as part of pci dss you do

386
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,480
have data flows right if you're doing

387
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,560
pci dss please tell me you have data

388
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,240
flows and process flows if you don't

389
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,399
don't tell me you'll break my heart

390
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,560
but those types of things that we

391
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,079
already have tools we already know we

392
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,399
can use in the space

393
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,480
with that path we can start looking at

394
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,800
how we can move people along that path

395
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,880
easier to make sure that they stay on

396
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,519
the happy path as it's called that they

397
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,560
are able to in this example

398
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,440
report enough information on a fish so

399
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,560
that we can investigate and eliminate it

400
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,480
there's a few scientific concepts that

401
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,120
we can look at familiarity which

402
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,440
i talked about a lot and i'll touch on

403
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,040
just a minute

404
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,959
looking at nudges

405
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,720
which are a way to move people forward

406
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,119
on the process and looking at sludge

407
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:11,359
which is another way to codify friction

408
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,039
so in terms of familiarity you guys have

409
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,799
probably heard me say a million and one

410
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,799
times that when work looks like work

411
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,599
work gets done so important for whatever

412
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,559
the

413
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,720
uh design is we're looking at

414
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,400
back

415
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,039
to the email this is one of the reasons

416
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,880
why the phishing emails work right

417
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,160
because they look like work so it's

418
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,559
gonna get done i'm used to clicking i

419
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,520
click in my email all the time i'm used

420
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,760
to you know sending invoices this is the

421
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,160
way it works and the way that any good

422
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,440
social engineer would tell you that

423
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,600
they're successful is by

424
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,480
emulating how work it stops we can use

425
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,720
the same principle for security

426
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,840
behaviors

427
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,480
if reporting is just like emailing or if

428
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,840
it's just

429
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,919
a very simple process they're not having

430
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,760
to go to another forum and copy paste

431
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,840
and

432
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,559
download if it's right within their

433
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,200
outlook even with a report button

434
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,160
those things are going to get

435
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,799
accomplished

436
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,440
now nudges

437
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,679
are

438
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,480
positive psychological pushes to get

439
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,679
people to do the right thing there's a

440
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,960
whole book on that just called

441
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,039
appropriate enough nudge uh it's a

442
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,640
little bit dry but it's not there if you

443
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,280
want to read it the opposite of this is

444
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,120
really where i'm more concerned which is

445
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,600
sludge and sludge

446
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,840
is all the little nudges that get people

447
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,720
to not do things all the hidden friction

448
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,200
that is in place that obstructs their

449
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,520
work

450
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,200
with

451
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,760
that

452
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,600
comes the realization that we very

453
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,480
rarely measure

454
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,960
sludge it's very difficult to see it

455
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,880
oftentimes goes unnoticed

456
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,480
we do get reports when people aren't

457
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,400
doing things right we get reports when

458
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,640
people are going too long

459
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,640
there's a good paper that talks actually

460
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,360
about implementing a dashboard

461
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,000
for sludge which i think is really

462
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,400
interesting if we measure compliance

463
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,559
rates not necessarily

464
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,240
as a way to say

465
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,679
are people screwing up are they doing

466
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:14,799
the right thing

467
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,120
but if we measure compliance rates as a

468
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,320
way of saying let's identify

469
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,160
where the sludge is

470
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,760
i worked with an organization that did

471
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,840
this very well they had a an identity

472
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,240
nexus management program

473
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,640
and one of their kpis was the percentage

474
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,200
of users that went through the the

475
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,600
formal onboarding and off boarding

476
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,679
as a percentage of the total users so

477
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,600
you could catch the delta the exception

478
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,840
the people who worked around the process

479
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,520
now ordinarily in security what would

480
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,600
you do you'd write them up right yeah

481
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,039
go talk to them

482
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,880
i'm going to have a conversation with

483
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,039
that guy

484
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,720
instead they used this signal as a way

485
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,720
to prioritize

486
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,799
the security advocate champion program

487
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,360
to work on what was wrong if they worked

488
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,679
around the process why why was that how

489
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,520
can we get better

490
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,400
at

491
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,320
identifying what went wrong and work

492
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,919
with those people and that wasn't

493
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,080
something that's going to be identified

494
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,440
out of the gate right you're not going

495
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,240
to see sludge unless you're measuring it

496
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,840
the other thing you can do with the path

497
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,000
is start to think about

498
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,360
um

499
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,880
inclusivity

500
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,960
anything that is

501
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,640
um you know anything that is

502
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,440
harming people in diverse populations

503
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,200
and start thinking through it that way

504
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,559
which is another thing you're not

505
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,200
necessarily going to identify

506
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,200
unless you're looking for this so maybe

507
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,480
it's someone with a wheelchair that's

508
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,400
getting stuck in the sludge

509
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,480
this gets to one of my favorite findings

510
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,640
when i was going through this research

511
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,559
and it is an ongoing process to go

512
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,559
through this research which was the curb

513
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,120
cut effect well worth looking into but

514
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,120
so many people push back like oh well

515
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,120
diversity and inclusion blah blah blah

516
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,720
you know we're taking our eyes off the

517
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,919
ball we're not this doesn't help anyone

518
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,600
however

519
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,840
what is fascinating is this thing called

520
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,919
the curb cut effect what they have found

521
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,720
is time and time again that when you

522
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,270
optimize for

523
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,760
[Music]

524
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,880
folks that

525
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,679
are

526
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:18,880
not

527
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,039
taking the easy path that do have

528
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,559
difficulty right when you optimize for

529
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,240
people with disabilities or further

530
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,720
issues when you do that you actually

531
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,440
raise the performance the environment

532
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,600
for everybody right if you work on

533
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,600
maternity leave and paternity leave you

534
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,919
raise the performance and the quality of

535
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,159
life for everybody

536
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,760
this comes from

537
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,440
a famous

538
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,880
real world example that's where they put

539
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,039
in curb cuts for people with wheelchairs

540
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,559
and now of course everyone uses curb

541
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,120
cuts for strollers and for suitcases

542
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,039
when we travel god willing when we

543
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,200
travel

544
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,360
so this gets to

545
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,640
interesting observation with

546
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,760
the the people between the keyboard and

547
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,360
the monitor

548
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,720
or the keyboard in the chair and that is

549
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,200
that accessibility leads to broader

550
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,360
benefits and water adoption

551
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,120
and what adoption for security controls

552
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,799
water adoption of our processes

553
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,960
all right

554
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,120
this also makes it pretty easy to

555
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,799
identify that hey look the people who

556
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,320
are breaking the rules right there are

557
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,760
exceptions that we get so riled up about

558
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,600
are actually those bold enough to give

559
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,440
us feedback about where our design is

560
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,880
not working

561
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,200
it's a great feedback mechanism to look

562
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,840
for the work hackers and figure out why

563
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,880
we're getting them in the get in the way

564
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,880
in terms of choices you know it's it's

565
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,720
all about making the secure choice the

566
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,720
easy choice making the secure choice the

567
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,280
default

568
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,640
and

569
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,559
this is important because oftentimes in

570
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,240
security we think that it's going to go

571
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,240
this way right we put in place our

572
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,240
control on the path that they're taking

573
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,360
now this is going to see that and

574
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,720
they're going to be like can i work

575
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,919
around it

576
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,440
no i can't this is an effective control

577
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,280
and hopefully the users will be happy

578
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,480
but of course

579
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,039
that's never how it plays out

580
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,120
in the real world what is much more

581
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,840
likely is uh we put in place these

582
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,280
controls

583
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,440
and the users are

584
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,360
highly motivated to break through the

585
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,039
controls and in breaking through the

586
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,280
controls working around them working

587
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,480
beside them

588
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,960
we end up inadvertently opening holes

589
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,200
for for adversaries and for other bad

590
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,760
things to happen it's a very important

591
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,679
aspect of human psychology that the more

592
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,480
constraints we put on users the more

593
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,240
creative users become and the more

594
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,400
creative users become

595
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,919
the more dangerous they become because

596
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,440
they're opening up holes in the

597
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,279
environment

598
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,720
so i want to talk

599
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,360
about an example of this of smart

600
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,679
defaults of low friction of adding

601
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,640
security on the path that doesn't impact

602
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,279
usability

603
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,240
and one of my favorite examples this is

604
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,840
touch id because everyone picks up their

605
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,960
phone right you pick up your phone you

606
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,799
wake up you pick up your phone

607
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,240
um half time

608
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,080
i'm in bed half asleep picking up my

609
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,440
phone

610
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,039
and then i'm saying stupid and something

611
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,279
stupid in my sleep but my wife is

612
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,600
tweeting it out on my behalf

613
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,279
good times good times so no this is how

614
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,520
people use phones and in the in the good

615
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,080
old days when everyone moved to apple

616
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,440
one of the benefits was you didn't have

617
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,720
to lock your phone i used to run a

618
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,000
blackberry environment everything was

619
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,240
locked down a nice great secure everyone

620
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,320
moves to uh apple and uh in moving to

621
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,039
apple uh it's not on my beds it's not my

622
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,480
control they don't lock it down no one

623
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,760
liked their phones no one liked their

624
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,400
phones before touch id uh i'm sure

625
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,559
someone did but i would go out and live

626
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,360
and say no one did and touch id comes up

627
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,400
now when touch id came out in 2015

628
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,480
they they actually

629
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,320
did something very clever they looked at

630
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,679
how people using the phones again you

631
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,919
pick it up you hit the home button

632
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,200
and that's where they decide to put the

633
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,799
touch sensor it wasn't a separate

634
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,080
gesture

635
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,000
it wasn't another button it wasn't

636
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,120
another thing that people had to

637
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,200
remember to do you pick up your phone

638
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,880
and it automatically authenticates you

639
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,760
by my biometric

640
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,000
pretty clever right on the path low

641
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,840
friction now what about defaults they

642
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,840
made it a default to enroll people they

643
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,480
made it incredibly easy to do so and

644
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,799
because of that combination

645
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,120
of putting the emphasis on the machine

646
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,480
right we're going to do biometric

647
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,120
security not require a complex password

648
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,360
putting it on the path okay people pick

649
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,520
up the phone they hit the home button

650
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,720
making a smart default because of that

651
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,400
people using lock screens within the

652
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,440
first year jump to over 80 percent

653
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,760
really really great example of security

654
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,440
that was well done well designed

655
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,200
so a lot of folks will argue hey

656
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,000
it's it's security or usability how many

657
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,320
talks begin with let's talk about why

658
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,480
it's always security usability

659
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,679
if it is if it truly is security or

660
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,919
usability in an environment i would

661
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,080
argue it's because we're using the wrong

662
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,080
model to figure out where we need to put

663
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,360
security i would argue it's because

664
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,039
we're doing it wrong

665
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,120
and if i'm wrong

666
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,960
hit me up because i would love to have

667
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,880
coffee with you and see if i can solve

668
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,279
it and if i can't solve it well coffee's

669
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,960
on me either way so

670
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,039
what do you got to lose hit me up let me

671
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,039
know

672
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,440
another link i'll i'll

673
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,320
provide you guys to is

674
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,799
soups which has been doing a lot of

675
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,799
research annually

676
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,760
on usability and privacy and they look

677
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,360
very closely on the space how do you

678
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,400
make usable security i mentioned earlier

679
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,640
one of the interesting papers i read was

680
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,880
that too little friction is almost as

681
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,679
bad as too much that comes from from a

682
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,600
paper i read in soups they looked at

683
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,880
different ways people could do

684
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,400
multi-factor you push code or

685
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,720
security token or you know your code on

686
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,080
a token you're typing in all the

687
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,080
different ways and uh and then they

688
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,760
asked people what was jesus to use and

689
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,360
they asked people was the most secure

690
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,840
and there was a really interesting uh

691
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,559
overlap and people picked the most

692
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,200
secure option to them perception wise

693
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,520
the most secure option was the one that

694
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,760
added a bit of friction but was still

695
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,200
usable

696
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,039
it wasn't necessary even if the security

697
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,399
properties were way better for something

698
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:37,760
that didn't interfere with them at all

699
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,880
that wasn't the one that they thought

700
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,480
was more scarce with a little bit of

701
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,760
friction

702
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,760
and that gives me some hope because i'm

703
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,360
pretty sure in our future there's always

704
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,120
going to be a little bit of friction so

705
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,479
that gives me a little bit of hope

706
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,200
all right let's next talk about the fact

707
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,840
that we're we're playing two two games

708
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,320
right security capabilities have to do

709
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,640
two things at once we've got to

710
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,799
um get in the way of the adversary and

711
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,559
we've got to get out of the way the end

712
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:05,520
user

713
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,480
and this is another aspect

714
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,679
that i believe can be forgotten

715
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,799
in especially if you're looking at a

716
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,880
compliance standard or a check box

717
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,399
approach we're just trying to add

718
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,720
controls and especially if you're

719
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,320
building systems right when we're

720
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,240
building systems we're building

721
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,760
applications

722
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,360
uh on the product side in the cloud

723
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,960
we need to remember that the features

724
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,760
we're giving our users are effectively

725
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,919
the exploits we're giving our attackers

726
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,480
be that remote access

727
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,600
from an i.t perspective be that sign ups

728
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,159
uh there was a a lot of

729
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,000
uh telephone fraud in the mfa space uh

730
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,080
why because we allow people very easy we

731
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,000
want to make it easy low friction sign

732
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,039
up we want to give you options sure use

733
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,000
callback uh put in any number you want

734
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,760
and so what the adversaries do they

735
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,600
build bots and those bots go ahead and

736
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,200
register a bunch of fake accounts and

737
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,559
they use

738
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:09,679
uh 900 numbers or other toll numbers uh

739
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,880
as the the mfa and then they go ahead

740
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,640
and execute that and

741
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,840
the person

742
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,600
logs in spot

743
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,200
and the

744
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,480
mfa request goes out to a toll number

745
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,000
and then the total number charges the

746
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,760
mfa provider or the sms provider um

747
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,679
a fee and then that fee gets kicked back

748
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,480
to the adversary

749
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,480
i don't think anyone would have thought

750
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,720
that that was an exploit

751
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,320
that we were building

752
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,279
for attackers right when we're building

753
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,399
uh an easy to to authenticate system

754
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:45,840
so we always need to think through each

755
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,360
one of our features and figure out how

756
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,120
they can be exploited threat modeling

757
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,520
here is incredibly important

758
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,440
um as a way to do this

759
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,720
regardless of how you're doing if you're

760
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,240
doing stride or if you're doing a

761
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,559
different method um we want to make sure

762
00:29:58,559 --> 00:29:59,919
that the the people building our

763
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,360
products

764
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,960
are thinking not only on the code level

765
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,399
but also the feature level we want to

766
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:05,679
make sure the people who are putting

767
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,080
place rit systems are thinking not only

768
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,520
on the oh look i enabled tls we must be

769
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,360
secure

770
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,679
but also are thinking about

771
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,320
uh what that means

772
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,200
for

773
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,399
uh an adversary when you have your

774
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:26,158
systems suddenly exposed in the internet

775
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,240
that also means a good security course

776
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,480
is applied on the paths and choices the

777
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,480
users and the adversaries make it's the

778
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,000
intersection right we're playing two

779
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,520
games at once this exact model applies

780
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,480
not only to the workforce using maps and

781
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,399
control frameworks and trying to reduce

782
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,799
steps simplify but also to the

783
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,600
adversaries

784
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,080
what does that look like well it looks

785
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,919
like on the adversary side on the

786
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,000
criminal side using threat models or

787
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,760
attack paths

788
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,159
i'm doing a i really do like the path

789
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,240
model but everyone's going to vary but

790
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,919
watching that path the adversary is

791
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,240
going to take in our environment

792
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,480
and looking at where we can inject steps

793
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,880
and each time we go to inject the step

794
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,200
looking at it back in terms of the end

795
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,760
user and where we can go ahead and put a

796
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,880
step that is invisible to them

797
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,480
looking at the meter attack framework um

798
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,480
any way we can increase steps or

799
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,480
increase choices

800
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,799
uh any way we can complicate the process

801
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,799
instead of simplifying it and any way we

802
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,600
can confound the adversary

803
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,360
one of my favorite ways of doing this

804
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,159
very

805
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,480
very wickedly simple example

806
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,000
was uh

807
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,039
uh

808
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:42,240
a a company that had a website that was

809
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,480
frequently attacked over

810
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,600
posted over nginx and what they did was

811
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,039
they figured users aren't usually going

812
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:51,600
to see 404s they should almost never see

813
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,960
500s

814
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,559
right http 404page not found http 500

815
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,559
server error so what we'll do is we'll

816
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,080
put a threshold in place and if you get

817
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,240
a whole bunch of 404s or if you get a

818
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,320
bunch of 500s we're going to block

819
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,320
access to that ip address for about 15

820
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,679
minutes

821
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,679
from a user perspective

822
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,600
a i should never see it and if i do okay

823
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,200
now i don't see the site for a few

824
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,679
minutes i'm gonna go get a cup of coffee

825
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:18,159
watch a youtube video uh

826
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:19,919
spend some time on twitter

827
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,320
and when i come back it'll be up and

828
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,919
we'll be okay

829
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:25,840
from an adversary perspective what now

830
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,960
happens is

831
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,640
we're following our path right and we're

832
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,480
going to scan the site for

833
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,840
vulnerabilities

834
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,000
which generates a whole bunch of 404s

835
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,080
and a whole bunch of 500s

836
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,399
and then that's going to get blocked

837
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,559
and then that block time is going to

838
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,799
break the scanner and the adversary is

839
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,320
going their automated tools are not

840
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,679
going to work they're going to why why

841
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:47,679
can't i get in and they'll fuss around

842
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,039
and try and figure it out maybe change

843
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,440
the ip address or whatever relaunch the

844
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,399
scan

845
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:53,919
and uh

846
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,919
on and on and on it goes i had a pen

847
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:58,240
tester who was trying to get into this

848
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,799
environment and he basically chewed up

849
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,880
so much time just trying to do the basic

850
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,799
enumeration and again this is a control

851
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,200
completely transparent to the end user

852
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,840
and 99.9 percent of the time

853
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,679
i want to talk a little bit more about

854
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,519
increasing steps because one of the

855
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,360
questions oftentimes is well how many

856
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,279
steps do we need how many steps does it

857
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,159
take

858
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,880
on an attack path before the adversary

859
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,120
can can be caught we know we want to add

860
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,760
steps we know we want those steps to to

861
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,840
be such that they're they're loud right

862
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,880
that they

863
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,360
trigger alerts or can be seen or can be

864
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,640
responded to by our defense team

865
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,799
we know that because if we do those sort

866
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,399
of a behaviors

867
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:43,360
we can execute ir we can

868
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,960
trace them down we can get them out of

869
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,799
the system

870
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,159
we know that we need to do that but what

871
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,600
is the right number of steps and it

872
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,840
really is a difficult thing to answer i

873
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,440
think it probably varies

874
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,919
environment by environment

875
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,519
one of the closest

876
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:00,000
uh we've ever come to this is the

877
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,600
verizon data breach report where they

878
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,080
actually looked at the number of steps

879
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,600
and the success

880
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,600
of the attack and i love this because

881
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,560
it's like oh if you get uh if you get to

882
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,719
about 10 steps or more

883
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,800
you've cut the success rate of the

884
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,719
attack in half

885
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,040
10 steps or more cut the success rate in

886
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,119
half now that's a great rule of thumb

887
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,079
i'm not going to say that's going to

888
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,639
work 100 of the time and success rate is

889
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,000
still pretty fuzzy right if it's a

890
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,679
really good attacker they're probably

891
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,359
going to get you at steps 11 12 15 20.

892
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:34,320
however i think directionally if we can

893
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,239
do an attack path and add just enough

894
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,639
steps to bump it over 10

895
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,879
probably in a really good place and

896
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,239
again if i'm wrong i would love to hear

897
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,560
from you

898
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,960
so when we start adding those steps we

899
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,560
can figure out different ways to do it

900
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,480
obviously mostly it's like oh we'll just

901
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,359
get in the way of the user

902
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,839
we may slow them down again i wouldn't

903
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,880
say slowing them down is terrible

904
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,800
especially for balancing that out with

905
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,880
some sludge diagrams or get some

906
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,720
feedback on the sludge side to know when

907
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,560
we're slowing them down too much but

908
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,200
stopping or slowing creates a pressure

909
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,200
on the user side of the game which

910
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,440
creates a likelihood that they'll work

911
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,760
around us which again creative users

912
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,359
creates danger

913
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:19,599
invisible is ideal to me or even speeds

914
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,359
up which is very very rare but i've

915
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:24,079
absolutely seen instances where security

916
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:27,280
is sped up the process

917
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,760
all right let's talk about this now in

918
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,960
terms

919
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,760
of a security program how do we apply

920
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,520
this model this way of thinking when

921
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,960
you're building out your security

922
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,359
program

923
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,240
i love programming i i don't do it

924
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,160
nearly enough anymore it was really my

925
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,320
gateway drug into computers i used to

926
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,640
program all the time in basic

927
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,160
you know for those of you who are going

928
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,680
way back you may remember a screen like

929
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,000
this right and it was always it was

930
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,320
always you would type in some command

931
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,640
load security and you get some syntax

932
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,359
there again and again and again

933
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,320
security or i'm sorry programming was

934
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,480
effectively the act of doing something

935
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,040
wrong repeatedly with very low cost

936
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,160
until you finally got something that

937
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,359
sort of worked

938
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:15,680
then you held your breath

939
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,680
what was fascinating about that what was

940
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,760
fascinating about that was

941
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,560
the um

942
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,760
[Music]

943
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,200
the fact that you didn't necessarily

944
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,880
blame

945
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,119
the computer right good programmers

946
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,720
especially back then

947
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,119
uh be it hobbyists or professionals

948
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,640
we're going oh i got a syntax here the

949
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,560
stupid computer

950
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,320
that's there's a problem between the

951
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,240
motherboard and the hard drive

952
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,720
no no you what you did was you recognize

953
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,240
okay i don't have enough knowledge i

954
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,079
don't have enough understanding yet i'm

955
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,599
going to try a different path i'm going

956
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:46,800
to try different command i'm going to

957
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,240
keep working

958
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,560
i think at some point in time when we

959
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,480
moved from

960
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,760
writing programs

961
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,720
uh

962
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,280
to running security programs maybe we

963
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,800
maybe we might have forgotten that

964
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,119
all right let's talk a little bit about

965
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,480
syntax errors

966
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,320
so in

967
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,480
in infosec or

968
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,480
with behavior changes there's

969
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,000
effectively

970
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,160
um eight different ways that we can get

971
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,920
a syntax error i'm not going to cover

972
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,920
all these but it's well worth looking at

973
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,280
them be it backfiring or treatment

974
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,520
offset by later behavior

975
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,200
and so on

976
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,800
each one of these is something that we

977
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,040
can see in in our environments i'll give

978
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,480
you an example of treatment offset by

979
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,160
later behavior in a really secure

980
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,760
environment this is one of the security

981
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,839
incidents that i faced uh when i was a

982
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:43,040
security officer in the financial

983
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,800
services sector real secure environment

984
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,960
loved it loved it and one day we got a

985
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,240
whole bunch of malware in our

986
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,079
environment

987
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:52,480
this should not happen i said we've got

988
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,480
endpoint segmentation

989
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,000
or isolation we've got endpoint

990
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,480
isolation i've got malware everywhere

991
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,200
how did this happen what went wrong

992
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,839
and uh in

993
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:05,280
investigating it was one of my guys one

994
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,839
of my vips had brought in place into the

995
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:11,119
environment uh an infected laptop

996
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,400
and i'm like why why why why did you do

997
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,800
this so i knew it was infected i'm like

998
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,160
why and i guess a wolf

999
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,520
where else would i bring it this is the

1000
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,040
most secure place i could think of to

1001
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,170
work on it

1002
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:27,119
[Laughter]

1003
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,839
okay okay so treatment offset by later

1004
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,680
behavior we can think through

1005
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,400
any one of the ways that uh security

1006
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,119
behavior is not effective and map it to

1007
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,359
these syntax errors i'd encourage you to

1008
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,280
look at this paper some great advice on

1009
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,160
what to do next also that gives you an a

1010
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,760
chance to figure out where we can go

1011
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,880
from there

1012
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,560
from a troubleshooting perspective one

1013
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,599
of the things i really like from a

1014
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,280
troubleshooting perspective is the four

1015
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,240
eyes framework so um

1016
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,680
ignorance is what we almost always

1017
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,720
assume they just don't know what they're

1018
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,839
doing uh irrationality right ah they're

1019
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:05,040
they're they're uh they're not rational

1020
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,520
uh fun fact no human is rational so i

1021
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,359
think that would just kind of be

1022
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:13,119
kind of be taken as as a as a given also

1023
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,599
if it is an irrationality issue is that

1024
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:19,200
not a problem of the program we've built

1025
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,800
that is leading them to not understand

1026
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,079
what to do

1027
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,079
i would i would think so

1028
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,079
most security awareness programs most

1029
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,240
talks tackle these two and don't get any

1030
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,440
further

1031
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,599
there are two more to consider one is

1032
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:34,000
incentives and some of the best security

1033
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,680
programs i've seen especially in the

1034
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,760
devops space

1035
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,960
are

1036
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,079
working to align incentives between the

1037
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,839
security team the ops team and the dev

1038
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,280
team

1039
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,839
and finally investments uh some of the

1040
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:49,520
greatest programs i've seen

1041
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,280
from a cso perspective is where the cso

1042
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,040
sits down with the business unit the

1043
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,200
developers or whatever and says hey we

1044
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,800
want to help you with the business case

1045
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,680
for better tooling uh why because it'll

1046
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,680
make your lives better and why because

1047
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,200
it'll make

1048
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,800
our lives as security professionals

1049
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,640
better if you've got

1050
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,280
better tooling that can surface issues

1051
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,440
you got better tooling that can do good

1052
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,359
backups she's working with a small

1053
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:15,119
product company recently

1054
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:17,760
and uh and they're going through this in

1055
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,839
terms of an investment

1056
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:22,000
in in backup software

1057
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,480
due to concerns around ransomware

1058
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,640
also to make sure that uh the backup

1059
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,640
software is encrypting the backups which

1060
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,920
apparently in some cases is not feasible

1061
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,560
with open source tools and not too happy

1062
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,480
about that last part i don't know why

1063
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,160
you would do a backup and not encrypt it

1064
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,119
but anyways so you can start to see how

1065
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:42,560
security team can partner with these

1066
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,000
other teams to put in place good uh

1067
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,920
programs

1068
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,800
again i got uh i've got a lot on the

1069
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,480
science page and collecting research on

1070
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,319
this if you've seen any good studies

1071
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:57,759
please do send them my way

1072
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,760
all right let's talk a little bit about

1073
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,720
these

1074
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,439
at a high level

1075
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,640
the ignorance side

1076
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,040
always cracks me up we'll just do

1077
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,960
security awareness

1078
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,359
security awareness would work

1079
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,200
we would have probably made some

1080
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,560
progress by now but it never works it

1081
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,359
never seems to work there was a study by

1082
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:25,920
the isf in 2020 that found after good

1083
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,280
security awareness i'm going to caveat

1084
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,040
that good security awareness we're not

1085
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,520
talking about those terrible videos or

1086
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,599
those websites you click through in two

1087
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,920
minutes to answer good

1088
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,000
security awareness after good security

1089
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,240
awareness how much behavior change did

1090
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,480
we see and the answer was

1091
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,520
less than fifteen percent

1092
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,280
with security we oftentimes think that

1093
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,800
it's the user's problem another

1094
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,960
oftentimes fallacy we have is that

1095
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,119
security is completely unique

1096
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:56,560
and therefore there's no other fields we

1097
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,800
can look at i was looking at another

1098
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,920
area where we saw less than 15 percent

1099
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,720
behavior change after awareness and that

1100
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,880
uh that was voting voting had this exact

1101
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,720
same problem if you just call someone to

1102
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,720
make them aware that there's a vote

1103
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,240
coming up they're not going to change

1104
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,760
their behavior

1105
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,000
so what they did was experiment with

1106
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,359
several different factors and they came

1107
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:19,200
up with this idea of having a plan

1108
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,839
having positive peer pressure

1109
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,720
having a wrapped around your identity

1110
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,960
and when they included all these factors

1111
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,880
the ability to get people out to the

1112
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,599
polls went through the roof

1113
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,599
so how do you how do you have a plan

1114
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,040
well you know this is where we're

1115
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,720
talking about security champion someone

1116
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,880
within the business that's embedded

1117
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,240
that's taking action on these things

1118
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,160
how do you make sure it's part of their

1119
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,520
identity well um one of my favorite ways

1120
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,040
back in the day from a devops

1121
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,640
perspective was using something like

1122
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,920
rugged where

1123
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,760
your developers your devops people were

1124
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,599
like yeah we're rugged this is part of

1125
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:57,280
our identity we write good code and good

1126
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,800
code means secure code and clean code

1127
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,520
so you wrap those in and you can get a

1128
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,400
lot further with your behavior changes

1129
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,760
than just saying oh

1130
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,920
don't don't click that

1131
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,880
from an irrationality perspective

1132
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,720
uh we need to think about how we're

1133
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:18,319
delivering these messages

1134
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,240
um

1135
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:24,240
i'm going to skip ahead a few slides

1136
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,880
from an incentives perspective

1137
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,040
there's a lot more from incentives and

1138
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,440
investments that we can do

1139
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,000
uh than just trying to align incentives

1140
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,720
part of it is is looking at any barriers

1141
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,319
for the behavior right what's what's the

1142
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:40,160
barrier of completing that path and

1143
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,000
removing that barrier that in and of

1144
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,560
itself can be an incentive sometimes

1145
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,119
um it's also looking at any benefits is

1146
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:49,440
there anything we can do to to amplify

1147
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,240
the benefit of completing this process

1148
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,920
so back to my fishing example and

1149
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,000
reporting maybe we we run a lotto on

1150
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:56,800
that

1151
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,720
and and provide some some financial

1152
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,000
compensation

1153
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,760
uh or maybe we don't i was reading a

1154
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,280
book on incentives it said if you tie

1155
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,200
things to financial compensation that

1156
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,280
can actually have a backfire effect we

1157
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,960
need to explore these things and try

1158
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,079
them out

1159
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,800
uh and get some real world data on on

1160
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,119
what works and what doesn't it's really

1161
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:18,800
difficult to know where the barriers are

1162
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,960
and where the benefits are especially

1163
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,960
we're sitting in security

1164
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,359
and many people think and talk in terms

1165
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:28,240
of security champions but really view

1166
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,839
those security champions is just a

1167
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:31,920
one-way communication path right i told

1168
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,599
the champion they'll tell the team

1169
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:35,359
things will get done

1170
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:37,920
we also i believe need to look at

1171
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,880
security advocates uh security advocate

1172
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,880
is someone within the security program

1173
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,880
itself their role is to advocate to the

1174
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,040
champions into the business units their

1175
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,200
roles to share the business knowledge

1176
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,640
back with us

1177
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,040
help fight sludge help fight security

1178
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,079
fatigue and keep those champions enabled

1179
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:57,359
so as we think about how we get

1180
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:59,280
information points from point a to point

1181
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,720
b from the security speed to the

1182
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,000
business me

1183
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,280
it really is having the conversation

1184
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,599
with the advocate to the champion to the

1185
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:09,200
businessman

1186
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,359
but it cannot be one way it also has to

1187
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:14,319
be back from the business me

1188
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:16,880
to the champion to the advocate to us

1189
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,040
why so that we can better design our

1190
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,760
security programs to reduce friction to

1191
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,040
reduce

1192
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,440
issues

1193
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,920
so we all know that phishing is one of

1194
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,480
the biggest issues i want to talk on

1195
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,960
next how we apply these concepts to

1196
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,079
phishing

1197
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:37,920
and uh and that will wrap up this talk

1198
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:38,640
so

1199
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,200
with with passwords what can we do there

1200
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,520
well maybe we can remove the password

1201
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,520
altogether so there isn't uh so there's

1202
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,000
a passwordless authentication mechanism

1203
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,920
uh maybe we cannot require so much

1204
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,359
rotation we can use other trust factors

1205
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:55,280
is it really you are you on a device we

1206
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,520
know are you coming in at a time that we

1207
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,160
know there's a lot in the authentication

1208
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,839
space that we can do

1209
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:03,920
to put more on the machine and add

1210
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,079
telemetry around device integrity device

1211
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,920
health uh and require less of the user

1212
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,240
around the mfa it is using simpler

1213
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,359
factors

1214
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:14,640
um

1215
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,119
stronger factors so push

1216
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:18,720
security tokens

1217
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,040
uh i mentioned muscle memory and when

1218
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,640
work looks like work making sure we

1219
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,640
don't have a million and one different

1220
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,640
mfa providers you have to memorize and

1221
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,560
know

1222
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:32,079
in terms of that phishing email itself

1223
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:33,520
it's

1224
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,000
uh doing things upstream to have better

1225
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,160
phishing detection it's doing remote

1226
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,720
detonation of any payloads following the

1227
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,119
links those types of activities that can

1228
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:44,800
happen before the email even gets the

1229
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,839
user's inbox it's also using the the

1230
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:50,079
concept of heard immunity where when one

1231
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:52,480
email gets into the inbox uh and gets

1232
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,839
reported we can remove it from

1233
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:56,000
everyone's email in the case of a blast

1234
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,200
spam

1235
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,960
and then the reporting itself making it

1236
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,400
very easy

1237
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,280
to report with a very familiar tool

1238
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,319
uh

1239
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:06,720
making their some benefit to that

1240
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,200
reporting reducing any barriers such as

1241
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,319
i'm going to get blamed we're going to

1242
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:12,160
get you know penalized you've got to

1243
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,160
remember that people

1244
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,440
oftentimes

1245
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,319
really view us as an act of

1246
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:20,800
of negative

1247
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,559
you know consequences the security team

1248
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:24,400
i'm talking about there's been cases

1249
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,880
where from a push perspective

1250
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,800
people will get a

1251
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,880
a bad push

1252
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,240
and there's a you know a button on your

1253
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,839
phone that says hey report this and they

1254
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:35,200
won't report it why because they don't

1255
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,559
want to get in trouble because

1256
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:38,480
oftentimes accepted

1257
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,839
just so they don't get in trouble and

1258
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:40,960
then they'll figure out what's going on

1259
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,240
the back end

1260
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,440
maybe figure out what's going on the

1261
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,680
back end so we need to make sure that

1262
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,480
culturally where we're reducing any

1263
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,800
barriers to reporting and amplifying any

1264
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,359
benefits using some of the psychological

1265
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:55,920
methods i mentioned earlier

1266
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,920
now we would follow all that through and

1267
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,680
do the attack path of what an adversary

1268
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,160
is doing who's doing fishing and look at

1269
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,920
that attack patch and add things along

1270
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,160
the way from their perspective again

1271
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,079
it's more on the users this talk is more

1272
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:10,400
on the users than an adversaries but

1273
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,920
just keep in mind we are playing two

1274
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,440
games here

1275
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,680
notice what i did say was phishing

1276
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:19,040
emails i'm very anti-phishing emails uh

1277
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,960
uh this phishing simulation i'm talking

1278
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,119
about

1279
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,119
we already have a hard time engaging

1280
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:28,640
users why are we telling uh frontline

1281
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,359
workers they're gonna get a bonus

1282
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:32,800
and and then

1283
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,240
criticizing them uh and writing them up

1284
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,000
when they

1285
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,839
don't right

1286
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:41,119
why are we

1287
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:44,000
or when they fall for a fish why are we

1288
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,160
why are we offering nurses vaccines this

1289
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,839
happened when the vaccine started

1290
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:48,960
rolling out

1291
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,359
and using that as a way to to fish them

1292
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:53,040
why are we going after some of these

1293
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,839
underlying physiological and safety

1294
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:58,319
needs and using that and then wondering

1295
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:00,079
why they won't report to us or talk with

1296
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:00,720
us

1297
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,880
very anti-fishing simulation i'm

1298
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,079
collecting

1299
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:06,319
a number of stories and working on what

1300
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:07,920
probably a paper

1301
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,200
or or the very minimum a presentation on

1302
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,760
how to do fishing awareness with zero

1303
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,720
fish no simulation no messing with users

1304
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,440
i just think it's too dangerous

1305
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,680
but along this entire path

1306
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,559
we want to increase usability and we

1307
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:27,280
want to uh increase defensibility and

1308
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,680
you do that by lowering the friction and

1309
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:33,200
the choices and the steps on the one and

1310
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,240
increasing on the other

1311
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,760
now this was only uh usability and

1312
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,160
defensive usability talk right this is

1313
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,040
where we focus in on today

1314
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,599
there's an entire way of applying this

1315
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:49,119
to defensibility which i somewhat

1316
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:50,400
touched on

1317
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,839
there's also the concept of

1318
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:53,839
manageability how do we use the same

1319
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:55,839
model to make our systems easier to

1320
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:57,280
manage and support from security

1321
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,599
operations center perspective

1322
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:01,520
and auditability how do we make sure

1323
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,160
that we're adding telemetry

1324
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,880
and capturing evidence along the entire

1325
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:07,839
path

1326
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:10,079
to make sure that this is

1327
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:11,040
doable

1328
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,920
uh is this this approach which started

1329
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,200
out just a couple years ago with a

1330
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,760
simple question on the circle city stage

1331
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,839
is rapidly tending towards being a

1332
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:22,400
multi-day workshop if i'm honest

1333
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,559
uh but because i think there's a lot

1334
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:26,480
here in terms of thinking about the

1335
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,839
human factors from audit to manage to

1336
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:32,240
the defense capabilities to the

1337
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,598
usability capabilities

1338
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,000
all right i'm coming up on time i want

1339
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,440
to get back

1340
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,119
to

1341
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:43,920
the chair and the keyboard i would argue

1342
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,480
the the solution exists in the chair on

1343
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,480
the keyboard um so you guys might have

1344
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,000
noticed that i was talking the beginning

1345
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,839
with the sounding come out and i was

1346
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:54,319
narrating what was in this photo i'm

1347
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:55,599
sorry you guys missed it it was very

1348
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:57,839
good it was very funny i apologize maybe

1349
00:50:57,839 --> 00:50:59,440
you'll have to hit me up afterwards that

1350
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,440
i can fill you in on some of the easter

1351
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,040
eggs in this photo because it will not

1352
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,800
be now

1353
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,880
however one of the interesting things

1354
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,960
that happened when computers came out

1355
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,200
was that people started having issues

1356
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,200
right they started having a lot

1357
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,760
of complaints using computers physical

1358
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:16,720
issues

1359
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,119
issues about the chair issues about the

1360
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:20,800
keyboard

1361
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,040
and no one knew why computers are new

1362
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,640
what's going on we worked over here now

1363
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,000
working over there you're sitting down

1364
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,760
every day why how can you possibly be

1365
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,200
complaining about pain

1366
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:32,559
so they did a very exhaustive study as

1367
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:34,800
to why this was occurring and you're

1368
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,319
probably not going to be surprised right

1369
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:38,880
it was eye strain it was wrist strain it

1370
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,400
was back straight

1371
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,119
um the problem literally was the chair

1372
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:44,559
and the keyboard

1373
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,160
and the screen

1374
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,880
and what happened over the coming

1375
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,760
decades was we we've had a revolution

1376
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,480
in human factors and ergonomics we don't

1377
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,040
blame the person for eye strain we don't

1378
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,359
criticize people for for having back

1379
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:01,040
pain we understand that there needs to

1380
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,800
be a certain setup

1381
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,880
with the chair and the keyboard to

1382
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,280
comfortably work as a matter of fact uh

1383
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,240
when when my company shifted to

1384
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,720
uh work from home we had an ergonomics

1385
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,480
coach so i brought my camera around and

1386
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,400
i showed how i was setting up and they

1387
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,319
just like well no you really you agree

1388
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:20,319
you can't you can't live like this

1389
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:22,319
and i'm like what do i need to do like

1390
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:23,440
here's how you set everything up

1391
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,880
yourself put your chair just put your

1392
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,800
keyboard they didn't say you know wolf

1393
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,800
you're an idiot they didn't say well

1394
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,160
maybe they might have applied that but

1395
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,680
they didn't say that you know well if

1396
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,760
it's all on you you're you're a lesser

1397
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,520
human being because your body cannot

1398
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,559
adapt

1399
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:38,880
to the machine

1400
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,160
we adapt

1401
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,079
the machine

1402
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:44,160
and yet and yet

1403
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,400
four decades after that study i shared

1404
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,040
was published four decades after we

1405
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,800
still look at

1406
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,480
what we tell people

1407
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,240
don't put your bike here and we see them

1408
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,079
put the bike there

1409
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:58,079
and we still blame them

1410
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:00,400
for the incidents right

1411
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,960
security must catch up on these human

1412
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,040
factors we must we absolutely must catch

1413
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:05,760
up

1414
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,920
on the human factors side

1415
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,480
of using computers

1416
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,520
not only the physiological side

1417
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,960
we made some progress i think we made

1418
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,800
some progress at many conferences

1419
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,720
including circle city we're heading in

1420
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,520
the right direction

1421
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,680
in some ways we we've come so far in

1422
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,359
terms of how we think about security and

1423
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:27,119
how we imply it

1424
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:30,079
but we still have a significant way

1425
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:32,800
to go so i would encourage you guys all

1426
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,880
to apply these ideas in your environment

1427
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,880
to hit the button to hit the reset to

1428
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,680
stop blaming the user to consider human

1429
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:42,480
factors when we design to do so using a

1430
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,760
path model

1431
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,839
and uh and to give me feedback what what

1432
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:47,520
works what doesn't what am i not

1433
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,839
thinking about i would love to have

1434
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:52,800
conversations about this when ford had a

1435
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:53,920
ton

1436
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:57,040
of great conversations uh initially when

1437
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,119
i introduced this idea a couple years

1438
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:02,160
ago at circle city so thank you for that

1439
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,160
thank you for your time today and i hope

1440
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,799
you have a great conference
