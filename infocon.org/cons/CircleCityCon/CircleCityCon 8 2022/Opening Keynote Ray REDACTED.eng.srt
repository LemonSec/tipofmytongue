00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,760
foreign

4
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,760
if we were to do something that's never

5
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,079
been done before

6
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,800
such as starting a keynote early

7
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,079
now i have been told that the best

8
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,840
crackers in the world can do this in 60

9
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,360
minutes i need someone who can do it in

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,200
60 seconds you kidding

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,960
go

12
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,879
i need you to access the system give you

13
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,800
full access to their system you have to

14
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,559
access the system it's not the least

15
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,399
accessible system what's the hold up

16
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,399
just accessing the system angel i've

17
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,559
accessed a system she was murdered and

18
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:03,920
we believe it might have to do with

19
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,280
whatever it was she was trying to access

20
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,280
from your system i just got access to

21
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,520
the system how the hell did you access

22
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,920
this system a recent unknown intruder

23
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,560
penetrated using a super user account

24
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,240
giving him access to our whole system

25
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,159
marshall do whatever it takes to break

26
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,000
that encryption this may just be we need

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,520
to break the encryption they did manage

28
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,119
to break the uplink downlink encryption

29
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,400
they're paying hackers to break the

30
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,080
encryption once we break the encryption

31
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,280
how long before they break your

32
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,920
encryption and encryption like a code

33
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,759
yes ma'am two different systems of

34
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,680
encryption encryption i've never seen

35
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,280
somebody ask for my encryption key

36
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,360
that's not uncommon is it no but then

37
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,640
they ask for a higher level of

38
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,159
encryption to get rude access to a

39
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,000
python web server expose its ssl

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,280
encryption and then intercept all

41
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,280
traffic over its superior port i don't

42
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,720
think morse code is going to break the

43
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,560
encryption your efforts to break the

44
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,720
encryption codes will not be successful

45
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,720
we haven't had any luck breaking the

46
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,479
encryption sir we've made progress

47
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,000
breaking the encryption within seconds

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,840
of breaking charles encryption but as

49
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,280
soon as you break the encryption you

50
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,320
find me

51
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,798
yes sir

52
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,200
there's someone trying to download a

53
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,119
file right now who carry yeah i know

54
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,879
karaoke no no the other carries zips

55
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,200
downloading the file slowest speed

56
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,720
possible downloading the file right now

57
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,319
download the files can we just download

58
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,840
this file then i'll download the files

59
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,000
we are downloading all files i cannot

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,400
allow you to download my files

61
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,480
downloaded a file illegally here who

62
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,280
downloaded the files before it got shot

63
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,360
he downloaded a file he downloaded a

64
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,360
file and then he downloaded a file you

65
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,040
got 30 seconds to download that file you

66
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,640
copy download your file

67
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,879
downloading secure files

68
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,120
yes

69
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,000
listen that thing has just uploaded a

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,319
virus uploaded a virus i've uploaded the

71
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,160
virus so i'll blow the virus now and

72
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,000
upload the virus i uploaded the same

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,440
virus and i'll upload a virus

74
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,720
unfortunately i'm gonna need the

75
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,560
mainframe security code which is

76
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,200
tattooed on the king's lower back sir

77
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,959
he's uploading the virus everything but

78
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,599
the virus i gave it a virus

79
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,640
computer

80
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,879
virus it works like a computer virus

81
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,200
it's a computer virus a hacker

82
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,238
planted the virus

83
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,480
okay okay this is what we want if you

84
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,680
guys are getting paranoid and logging

85
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,760
off the network

86
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,920
just logging off please all right let's

87
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,879
teach a lesson about dmca violations

88
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,159
first and foremost everybody uh welcome

89
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,599
circle citycon track one i am ray

90
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,159
redacted this is the complete history of

91
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,319
hacking and freaking and what we're

92
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,319
going to be talking about today

93
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,400
is really five or six generations of

94
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,440
hacking and we're going to try to do

95
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,760
this very very quickly in under 3000

96
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,920
seconds actually so in the interest of

97
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,560
that time who am i if you recognize my

98
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,319
voice it's probably from the tribe of

99
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,280
hackers podcast uh recently i became a

100
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,280
producer for the show dartmouth diaries

101
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,200
which is a podcast as well

102
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,439
i'm also involved in some non-profits

103
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,120
for infosec like mental health hackers

104
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,040
and diana initiative and hacking is not

105
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,560
a crime and some other things like that

106
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,159
but nobody cares about that we're here

107
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,120
to talk

108
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,480
about the history of hacking now

109
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,799
this talk kind of evolved as a joke

110
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,400
making fun of a twitter thread where

111
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,079
people were talking about fifth

112
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,720
generation cyber defenses six generation

113
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,560
exploits uh a lot around marketing fud

114
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,120
okay a fear uncertainty and doubt but

115
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,800
actually it kind of came together and

116
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,360
became an actual story and that is

117
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,960
around the fifth generation so let's

118
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,880
start at the very very beginning

119
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,680
in the very very beginning uh before any

120
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,840
of this actually began and began real we

121
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,520
have kind of what we call in the star

122
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,960
wars

123
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,120
thought process kind of like think of it

124
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,440
as the proto-jedi before the jedi ever

125
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,880
existed at all

126
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,120
it was a group of people and believe it

127
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,000
or not

128
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,120
uh some of them that you don't

129
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,160
necessarily hear about in the history

130
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,759
books but you should

131
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,080
uh are ada lovelace who was the first

132
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,639
person that ever realized that computers

133
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,240
could do analytics instead of just

134
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,759
calculations

135
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,520
and also uh alan turing so alan turing

136
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,039
of course is a cryptographer inventing

137
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,440
the logic engine we would never have ai

138
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,280
we probably wouldn't even have computing

139
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,600
as we know it today uh without alan

140
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,000
turing and lived a very

141
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,080
uh difficult life because of persecution

142
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,160
but that's another day in another talk

143
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,800
but the term hacking actually originated

144
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,280
and it all started at mit at the

145
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,360
massachusetts institute of technology

146
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,440
and specifically it was building 26.

147
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,039
so on this college campus they had a

148
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,039
building slated to be torn down and

149
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,720
whenever college kids know that there's

150
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,400
a building about to be torn down

151
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,800
they invaded it basically took it over

152
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,280
and they did what all college kids do

153
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,520
they built railroads they built model

154
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,919
railroads which was really an excuse for

155
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,080
a drinking club between graduate

156
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,080
students and undergraduates eventually

157
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,400
professors and they started hanging out

158
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,000
there now one of the things that's

159
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,360
interesting about building model

160
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,520
railroads is the switching the switching

161
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,600
of those those trains can be a little

162
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,440
bit complex and so

163
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,280
those students started going out after

164
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,759
midnight and grabbing equipment to help

165
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,680
and the most logical place to get

166
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,919
equipment to help was the telephone

167
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,520
central office where they had these big

168
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,160
computers that could do calculations uh

169
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,160
and do kind of things that were looked

170
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,840
forward ahead on the routing just like

171
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,400
ipp packets but this is trains right

172
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,400
uh and ultimately this is where a lot of

173
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,319
the the founding fathers of people

174
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,560
really started some of the ideas that we

175
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,440
have the the birth of a.i uh the kind of

176
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,160
the first real video games and lisp all

177
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,240
of this was happening at mit but

178
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,080
interestingly enough there was a memo

179
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,840
that talked about anyone working or

180
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,960
hacking

181
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,880
on the electrical system please turn it

182
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,919
off to avoid electro shock and we still

183
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,080
recommend that today but the other thing

184
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,840
that came out of this in the term of

185
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,319
hacking was something called code

186
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,400
bumming and what code bumming was

187
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,759
was if you had a 22 punch card program

188
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,360
that you needed to run but there's a big

189
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,960
huge backlog of people that wanted to

190
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,960
run them you could sneak yours in if you

191
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,880
could optimize another professor's code

192
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,280
so if you had 300 codes cards and you

193
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,759
got them down to 378 you could sneak

194
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,160
your 22 in and that was the concept of

195
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,440
code bumming

196
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,039
and that really is kind of hacking right

197
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,199
optimizing things and taking shortcuts

198
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,280
coming up with new ways uh to think of

199
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,160
things

200
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,919
they also said that it should be totally

201
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,919
unlimited and the attackers should be

202
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,199
judged by their hacking also promoted

203
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,360
to mistrust authority as well

204
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,120
then on october 4th 1957 i wonder if

205
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,400
anybody in the discord could take a

206
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,840
guess what happened that specific day

207
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,960
maybe we'll give away a coin or

208
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,160
something for the first person that

209
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,000
answers that october 4th 1957 at 7 28

210
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,759
p.m

211
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,800
the russians launched sputnik and the

212
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,879
collective reaction of the american

213
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,319
public and the american scientific

214
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,800
community was to freak out because

215
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,800
sputnik was very scary because if they

216
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,039
could put a satellite in the air over

217
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,560
the united states they could probably

218
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,639
put a weapon there as well and so the

219
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,759
response uh which was somewhat of a very

220
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,800
very swift and severe response

221
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,360
was to um

222
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,199
uh basically launched what became known

223
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,479
as defense department of defense

224
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:13,800
directive

225
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,560
5105 and that is

226
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,599
the creation of something called darpa

227
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,919
the defense agency research projects

228
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,800
agency and darpa was a couple different

229
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,039
things around pure research and around

230
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,160
development

231
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,599
but one of the most important things

232
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,080
they did was project mac

233
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,839
and project mac depending on who you

234
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,039
asked

235
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,120
maybe stood for multiple access

236
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,440
computing or it may have stood for

237
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,599
machine aided cognition

238
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,399
now most importantly what mac did was it

239
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,000
connected mit

240
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,519
with the other coast

241
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,399
so that actually built out what we later

242
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,080
started calling the darpanet and

243
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,720
eventually became the internet darpanet

244
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,680
was pre-internet and at this time this

245
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,600
first generation it was all about

246
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,320
curiosity and innovation this was about

247
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,839
pranks right it was really about

248
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,519
optimization there was no profit motive

249
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,640
whatsoever in the first generation so

250
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,560
that brings us to the second generation

251
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,240
and the second generation

252
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,480
is best epitomized

253
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,080
uh if you think about what happened in

254
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,000
the second generation it was really

255
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,320
about taking that sense of exploration

256
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,640
from the college campus into the world's

257
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,480
biggest computing network at the time

258
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,600
and this is sort of what summarizes that

259
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,519
switchboards were replaced by mechanical

260
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,480
systems

261
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,000
different noises were used to trigger

262
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,080
the switches

263
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,200
if you had perfect pitch like blind

264
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,360
phone freak joe and gracia you could

265
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,800
whistle calls through the network

266
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,839
let's see if i make it this time

267
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,839
this is really hard to do it sounded

268
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,519
like all the tones were present so it

269
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,200
phone should be ringing about

270
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,880
now

271
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,800
okay it hit the phone it just takes a

272
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,240
little while he even showed off his

273
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,720
skills for the local media from his one

274
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,120
phone to a town in illinois and back to

275
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,279
his other phone a thousand mile phone

276
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,200
call by whistling

277
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,360
joe ingressia says he used to do these

278
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,360
things because he is fascinated by the

279
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,360
technology

280
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,120
and of course uh you know this was

281
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,640
actually the age of freaking this became

282
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,640
known as freaking and the person that we

283
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,680
just saw just there was known as uh john

284
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,000
gracia he actually legally changed his

285
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,959
name

286
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,800
to joy bubbles

287
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,519
and uh he actually was uh featured in

288
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,040
the movie sneakers if you've ever seen

289
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,480
that movie before

290
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,399
he was a ham radio enthusiast

291
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,480
and had perfect pitch and it was a group

292
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,480
of folks called the blind

293
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,720
the blind freakers because they would go

294
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,600
to summer camps uh from and meet kids

295
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,760
from all over the united states and they

296
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,600
wanted to call each other

297
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,519
and this is how they taught each other

298
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,959
to do it it was basically to take over

299
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,880
uh the phone system and then thus form

300
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,720
the age of freaky and of course it was

301
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,360
all about exploring a monopolistic uh

302
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,519
culture in the united states called bell

303
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,640
and it had a tie-in to the

304
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,480
counterculture as well the the yippies

305
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,920
or the yipples

306
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,000
had a group of people that included

307
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,320
someone named al bell and another person

308
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,360
named abby hoffman now al bell and abby

309
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,600
hoffman felt like not only was it okay

310
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,360
to rip off the phone company not only

311
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,680
was it okay it was your moral duty to

312
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,240
rip off the phone company because the

313
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,200
phone company was the primary financer

314
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,720
of the vietnam war

315
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,079
1.5 billion dollars in 71 dollars

316
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,480
went to vietnam taxes so they started

317
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,720
publishing what we now know as a zine

318
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,880
okay called hacking mob bell and in the

319
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,040
very very first one they described how

320
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,680
to bill any phone calls whatsoever to

321
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,360
someone else's number basically is the

322
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,440
first ever freaking using a calling card

323
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,440
number and they very helpfully said

324
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,040
please don't bill it to the fbi whose

325
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,240
number is this and they actually

326
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,160
published that in the uh in the first

327
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,920
one but when p most people think about

328
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,600
freaking they don't really think about

329
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,839
carding they think about

330
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,399
uh the boxes right the boxes all the

331
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,040
colored boxes so um you know one of the

332
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,519
most famous ones was the red box which

333
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,920
was not the dvd rental redbox but the

334
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,079
kind that you could get a radio shack uh

335
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,440
tone generator

336
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,079
and you could uh basically build out a

337
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,279
very specific tone at 1700 hertz not

338
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,680
2600hz we'll get there in a second uh

339
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,959
and then based on that most of the

340
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,399
payphones i should back up because

341
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,079
there's a lot of young people there used

342
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,079
to be this thing called a payphone and

343
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,399
it was a telephone that was for public

344
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,959
use that people could put coins in okay

345
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,399
and when those coins dropped it

346
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,639
generated a tone to the operator of the

347
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,480
phone company and you could mimic those

348
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,399
tones and make them think that you would

349
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,920
actually put in a bunch of coins so with

350
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,040
a red box depending on how it was

351
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,639
configured you might play a whole bunch

352
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,399
of these tones and then you could make

353
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,000
it sound like coins were dropping in

354
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,160
some cases you could get you know a

355
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,079
refund for coins you never put in but

356
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,360
more importantly you could make phone

357
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,880
calls and this is actually what would

358
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,880
happen and how it would sound so for the

359
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,480
one that everyone cared about the most

360
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,320
was the five burst tones of 33 on 33 off

361
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,680
because those were quarters right nobody

362
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,880
wanted nickels

363
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,839
and this is what it would sound like

364
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,320
when you did it

365
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,639
so now i don't recommend playing that

366
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,480
into play phones these days at least not

367
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,600
anywhere that you don't want to be

368
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,200
arrested but

369
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,560
certainly this is the way that that

370
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,760
actually happened

371
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,600
so but the red box isn't the most famous

372
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,079
one the black box isn't either the most

373
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,160
famous one of all was the blue box now

374
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,760
the blue box was

375
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,680
based on the idea that telephones used

376
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,839
to have something called in band

377
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,200
signaling okay meaning that the

378
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,320
signaling was in the same medium as the

379
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,560
actual uh carrier the the voices were as

380
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,360
well

381
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,760
and bell had figured out that humans

382
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,079
would never make a tone at 2600 hertz

383
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,000
because it's a really unnatural tone in

384
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,360
in human language

385
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,120
and so what they decided to do was use

386
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,959
2600 hertz to basically be the in-band

387
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,760
signaling for operators etc and people

388
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,760
very quickly figured this out and

389
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,880
realized that if you did a tone

390
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,680
generation at 2 600 hertz you could do

391
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,680
all kinds of funny things you could you

392
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,360
could uh you could become an operator

393
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,120
you could grab trunks you could knock

394
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,040
people off phone lines um you could

395
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,320
definitely make long distance phone

396
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,880
calls etc so all of that kind of built

397
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,279
up until october

398
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,880
of 1971 when esquire magazine published

399
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,880
an article called secrets of the little

400
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,160
blue box

401
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,160
now the author of secrets of the little

402
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,199
blue box actually somewhat obscured some

403
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,880
of the details so that they wouldn't be

404
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,040
sued by the phone company but smart

405
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,480
people read between the lines and

406
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,440
realized

407
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,199
he's talking about something real so

408
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,240
even though

409
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,480
the plans and schematics describe

410
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,920
something somewhat fictional it was all

411
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,519
kind of tongue-in-cheek

412
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,480
this was a mass market

413
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,000
spreading of information that taught

414
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,399
people how to blue box

415
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,639
and one person in particular saw it and

416
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,639
had a reaction like this

417
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,240
well as i was talking to steve jobs on

418
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,120
the phone

419
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,600
i said it occurred to me that wait a

420
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,959
minute they're given too much

421
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,959
information about certain frequencies

422
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,720
and certain codes there's too much

423
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,639
information here this doesn't sound

424
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,160
right for a fiction

425
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,079
and so we decided to go check some of it

426
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,639
out so on a sunday we went to where's

427
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,160
the technical library you could sneak

428
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,079
into on a sunday well we picked the

429
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,720
stanford linear accelerator center

430
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,240
no question you go to any of these

431
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,639
places you know in the the high research

432
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,639
the very pure theoretical research type

433
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,320
places and boy i'll tell you there's no

434
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,839
such thing as a closed door or locked

435
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,680
door so we always found our way in and

436
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,120
we'd go up to the library and read all

437
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,120
the computer magazines every week and

438
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,519
when we found a book on the telephone

439
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,360
system and it had the same frequencies

440
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,120
that were mentioned in this article that

441
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,639
was called fiction

442
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,240
and we looked at each other and realized

443
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,839
that we had stumbled onto something that

444
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,279
was not fiction

445
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,199
so that of course is steve wozniak he

446
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,160
was the engineers engineer behind apple

447
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,120
but he's also paired with a non-engineer

448
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,040
sales type person who has a different

449
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,600
take on what happened

450
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,199
one of the things that waz and i did was

451
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,759
we built blue boxes uh

452
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,519
they were devices that you could build

453
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:04,720
you know when you make a long distance

454
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,120
phone call in the background

455
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,959
those are the telephone computers

456
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,480
actually signaling each other sending

457
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,920
information to each other to set up your

458
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,360
call there used to be a way to fool

459
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,040
the entire telephone system into

460
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,120
thinking you were a telephone computer

461
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,199
and to open up itself and let you call

462
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,720
anywhere in the world for free and these

463
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,680
were illegal i i have to add uh but in

464
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,079
spite of that we were so fascinated by

465
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,839
them that waz and i actually figured out

466
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,360
how to build one we built the best one

467
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,880
in the world it was the first digital

468
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,880
blue box in the world but it was the it

469
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,120
was the magic of

470
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,279
the fact that two teenagers could build

471
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,120
this box for a hundred dollars worth of

472
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,079
parts

473
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,160
and control

474
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,240
hundreds of billions of dollars of

475
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,600
infrastructure

476
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,120
in the entire telephone network in the

477
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,519
whole world that was magical

478
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,360
and

479
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,720
experiences like that taught us

480
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,959
the power of

481
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,079
ideas the power of understanding that if

482
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,079
you could build this box you can control

483
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,439
hundreds of millions of dollars worth of

484
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:06,559
telephone infrastructure around the

485
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,520
world that's a powerful thing

486
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,280
and

487
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,439
and that if we hadn't have made blue

488
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,199
boxes we there would have been no app

489
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,039
could have been no apple i mean think

490
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,480
about that for a second

491
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,559
they wanted a little tiny device that

492
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,640
could control billions of dollars worth

493
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,319
of infrastructure

494
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,079
and that's the way they founded apple

495
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,919
was using some of that money from

496
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,000
selling those so

497
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,919
and by the way wozniak's original blue

498
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,400
box had a warranty so if you opened it

499
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,600
up there was a little slip of paper

500
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,760
inside if it was authentic that said and

501
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,760
it's a secret message actually let's ask

502
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,280
the discord what the secret message was

503
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,720
whoever gets that one we'll give a coin

504
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,880
too uh there's a secret message inside

505
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,320
the blue box and if you had that you've

506
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,160
got a warranty so he had a digital and

507
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,320
it was a warranty so bell had a problem

508
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,840
and the problem was was people were

509
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,919
spending four or 500 bucks

510
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,360
to steal from the phone company and it

511
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,440
was becoming very popular with the mafia

512
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,280
but it's still a nuisance okay it's not

513
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,760
like not like a hundred thousand kids

514
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,200
are going to try this because kids don't

515
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,360
have access to making that tone uh you

516
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,720
know they can't do that if they wanted

517
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,160
to right surely we wouldn't have to

518
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,080
worry about teenagers

519
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,840
but then

520
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,799
general mills decided to ship a whistle

521
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,039
uh in their cereals that it turned out

522
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,520
generated could generate that 2 600

523
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,000
hertz stone so suddenly all over the us

524
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,200
kids were playing with this and one of

525
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,799
the easiest ways to play with it was

526
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,640
just to walk by a bank of pay phones and

527
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,000
blow in this whistle because it would

528
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,520
knock everyone off the pay phone if you

529
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,039
blew it loud enough you would knock all

530
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,280
these businessmen off their phones so it

531
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,600
became very very popular and it took off

532
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,679
quite a bit now the early pioneers in

533
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,400
this area were people like ian murphy

534
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,200
kevin paulson and brad carter uh ian

535
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,200
murphy decided he didn't like people

536
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,559
paying for long distance so he

537
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,320
reprogrammed all the phone switches in

538
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,080
north america so that they always

539
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,080
thought it was 2 am ok basically giving

540
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,080
everybody free phone calls he loves to

541
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,360
brag about being the first ever

542
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,200
convicted cyber felon

543
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,160
uh

544
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,760
et cetera so this became the age of

545
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,160
freaking and it was all about exploring

546
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,240
the telephone system to learn more and

547
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,559
more about it now when you were trying

548
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,240
to do this you were looking for certain

549
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,480
things you were looking for

550
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,919
a lot of different tricks around being

551
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,000
able to do simultaneous seizures

552
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,760
always busy numbers always ringing

553
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,840
numbers but with the grand prize were

554
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,600
loops and bridges so what loops and

555
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,679
bridges were were these were special

556
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,000
phone numbers where the testing phone

557
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
numbers where you could actually bridge

558
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,840
two different numbers together or even

559
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,240
allow multiple loops would be looping

560
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,679
two different numbers together and

561
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,600
bridges would be multiple parties that

562
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,679
are out there and if you look at the

563
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,080
deviant behavior psychology book they

564
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,720
talk about the fact that freakers were

565
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,960
desperately looking for these that are

566
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,760
basically for all practical purposes

567
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,360
conference calls right they were looking

568
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,799
for conference calls where multiple

569
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,559
people could dial in especially

570
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,520
toll-free and we spent so much of our

571
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,760
lives chasing these things down only to

572
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,080
grow up and then grow up to hate every

573
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,760
single conference call that we're on so

574
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,000
that's kind of the irony of that side so

575
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,400
that was the second age and then that

576
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,320
brings us to the third generation now

577
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,320
the third generation is loosely defined

578
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,760
as starting in the 80s probably 1984

579
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,720
okay

580
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,880
and most people know that's when 2600

581
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,159
started being published that's when a

582
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,480
lot of groups were formed you know 1984

583
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,320
was a special number anyway but what

584
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,039
most people don't realize is the huge

585
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,080
impact on our entire hacking culture

586
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,639
by this

587
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,799
what are you doing dying into the

588
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,480
school's computer

589
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:44,289
[Music]

590
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,240
they changed the password every couple

591
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,679
of weeks but i know where they write it

592
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:52,480
down

593
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,720
and a promising student

594
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,590
an old game

595
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,280
[Music]

596
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,679
with an electronic twist

597
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,640
those your grades yeah i don't think

598
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,260
that i deserved it if do you

599
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,600
[Music]

600
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,760
you can go to jail for that

601
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,919
only if you're over 18. this computer

602
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,360
company is coming out with these amazing

603
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,880
new games in a couple of months you

604
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,039
might want to play those games

605
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,559
wow

606
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,960
we got something he found the right code

607
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,760
word to play the game we're in

608
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,670
but it was the wrong computer

609
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:25,600
[Music]

610
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,960
of course that's war games i can't

611
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,799
really necessarily make that a challenge

612
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,600
but what war games uh taught

613
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,840
a lot of very interesting lessons first

614
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,120
and foremost it taught uh kids that by

615
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,120
mass dialing a bunch of numbers you will

616
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,880
find carrier tones that became known as

617
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,400
war dialing actually named after this

618
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,919
movie so what you would do is you would

619
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,039
blast an entire npa and xx usually at

620
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:47,919
night

621
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,080
looking for modem sounds like the the

622
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,000
ringing of a carrier tone and you might

623
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,400
go to bed and dial a thousand preferably

624
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,240
not in order and when you woke up in the

625
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,760
morning you might have three or four

626
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,600
carrier tones to explore now never mind

627
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,080
the fact that you probably woke up 997

628
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,919
people there wasn't really caller id

629
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,679
back then so it wasn't quite nearly the

630
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,320
problem that it would be later um but it

631
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,400
also showed pay phone freaking

632
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,320
where'sing he was looking for a game a

633
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,440
software that's why he was kind of

634
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,520
exploring that side but i don't know if

635
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,880
everybody caught this but one of the

636
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,080
biggest messages there was hey kids you

637
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,120
won't go to jail you're under 18 right

638
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,840
and that had a big lesson for a lot of

639
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,200
teenagers but for teenage boys in

640
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,880
particular the biggest lesson of all was

641
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,440
that hacking could get you laid

642
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,159
so

643
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,159
what that magically meant was we had an

644
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:37,600
explosion

645
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,480
of interest in bulletin board systems

646
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,840
there's a whole group of people that

647
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,520
entire subculture that kind of rose up

648
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,799
around that and a lot of different

649
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,039
things and by the way ronald reagan

650
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,280
watched that movie and freaked out

651
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,960
and called everyone together and said

652
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,360
hey i need you to tell me how real this

653
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,720
is could they really take over our

654
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,280
nuclear weapons and says this is what

655
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,600
happened has anybody seen this movie war

656
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,840
games nobody's seen it it just came out

657
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,200
it goes into this enormous

658
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,880
plot description people are looking

659
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,960
around wondering where this is going

660
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,440
then he turns to his the chairman of the

661
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,600
joint chiefs of staff general john

662
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,320
vessey and says general could could

663
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,080
something like this really happen could

664
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,559
someone just break into our most secure

665
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:21,679
computers

666
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,360
and the general says i'll look into that

667
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,080
mr president he comes back a week later

668
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,640
and says mr president the problem is

669
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,840
much worse than you think this leads to

670
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,480
the government's first presidential

671
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,240
directive on computer security

672
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,640
so of course that was the the some of

673
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,880
the earlier laws that were particularly

674
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,000
uh not necessarily so good uh but also

675
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,240
this was when the magazine 2600 started

676
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,520
being published

677
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,880
that's the hacker quarterly that's still

678
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,120
published to this day uh that of course

679
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,760
number is named after the uh the hertz

680
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,960
tone that we've just heard on the blue

681
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,200
box side uh in addition so what would

682
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,400
happen on these bulletin boards is you

683
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,400
would dial up and there'd be a hidden

684
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,559
secret area that no one knew about

685
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,279
called the hpp section and that would be

686
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,600
the hacking freaking and piracy

687
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,840
section and in this area this is where

688
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,520
you could get the goods okay the goods

689
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,960
were text files or t files or g files

690
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,760
about how to do shenanigans now not just

691
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,279
anybody got to get into those areas

692
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,720
because hey we don't want any cops in

693
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,000
here right

694
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,320
so what you would do to prove yourself

695
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,120
from an opsec standpoint is there was an

696
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,200
actual way of kind of showing off to

697
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,799
people that you were in the know and

698
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,240
that was to use something called

699
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,559
beatspeak believe it or not this is when

700
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,120
people started using that term

701
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,559
and the idea was was that you could

702
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,320
recognize another guy that was kind of

703
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,159
into this particular scene because they

704
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,760
would use these numbers instead of

705
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,919
letters or you know they're basically

706
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,080
glyphs and reflections et cetera now the

707
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,600
other thing that's kind of interesting

708
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,679
about this era is this is the first time

709
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,080
we ever heard the term zero day but zero

710
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,080
day did not refer at that time to an

711
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,559
unpatched exploit it actually referred

712
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,039
to software that had never been released

713
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,880
before so if you had three day wares and

714
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,520
i had two daywears oddjob had oday wares

715
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,880
that was unreleased it wasn't even in

716
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,880
the store yet and of course that later

717
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,520
went on to to mean unpatched exploits as

718
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,000
well which are also uh considered odas

719
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,520
but also

720
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,200
this was a great place for people to

721
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,760
learn in an 8-bit learning sandbox about

722
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,919
how to remove copy protection so groups

723
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,679
started forming about teaching that

724
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,760
about trading wares with the z

725
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,080
again part elite speak uh and and

726
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,200
basically they would have these

727
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,640
advertisements where you would actually

728
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,480
list these are people's home phone

729
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,720
numbers and in some cases

730
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,159
their phone numbers only worked after 10

731
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,840
p.m because they didn't want their mom

732
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,200
to know what they were doing so some

733
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,480
cases that would be it so i think it's

734
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,840
fascinating when you go through some of

735
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,320
these crack screens to see these numbers

736
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,559
and uh you know they're actually still

737
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,159
around in some cases and if you call a

738
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:51,520
pizza place and say hey did you know you

739
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,039
guys used to be a major where's board

740
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,120
for the cdc no they never know they

741
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,039
never remembered but anyway so these

742
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,480
groups started kind of forming loose

743
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,400
affiliations they became known as

744
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,039
cracking groups like for fahrenheit 451

745
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,880
and frozen crew and that eventually

746
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,720
became hacking groups

747
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,720
like uh with another thing about hacking

748
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,880
groups was you wanted a really scary

749
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,240
name so things like

750
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,200
legion of doom okay or

751
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,679
cult of the dead cow which

752
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,520
uh by the way if your mom found files

753
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,960
from the cult of the dead cow she was

754
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,919
really worried about you because she

755
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,440
thought you were occult

756
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,200
but that's not but i digress

757
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,080
and of course these guys were pranksters

758
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,240
they were fun they were they were a bit

759
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,000
anarchistic but but they kind of had

760
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,400
good hearts etc we always think in terms

761
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,600
of the distribution of black orifice and

762
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,120
you know uh

763
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,720
actually defcon okay that's a speaking

764
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,240
spell by the way for you young kids

765
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,600
that's a very interesting computing

766
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,480
device

767
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,200
um and basically this is really kind of

768
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,240
the height of the growth and expansion

769
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,159
of freaking into bbs's and that

770
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:53,520
knowledge expansion and we we think

771
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,919
about things like like blue beep

772
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,120
a lot of programs that are out there

773
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,799
that were like perfect for doing these

774
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,559
then you could get all kinds of programs

775
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,799
both on the commodore the apple ii and

776
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,640
for the wealthy kids maybe the ibm that

777
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,200
would actually generate tones and do a

778
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,279
lot of this exploration but it wasn't

779
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,360
the internet so it was still calling

780
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,240
bbs's one line at a time and waiting for

781
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,200
them to eventually uh link up so that

782
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,480
brings us now to basically the fourth

783
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,679
generation

784
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,320
now uh there's a lot of contention about

785
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,640
when the fourth generation started uh

786
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,399
many people think it started on

787
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,120
september 5th

788
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,159
1995 not just something they do sure the

789
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,000
sweet machine's not going to waste are

790
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,559
you challenging me

791
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,200
it's who they are i win you wear a dress

792
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,559
on our date and if i win so do you

793
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,960
they can

794
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,880
but this time come here look at this

795
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,799
it's some kind of virus unless five

796
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,399
million dollars is transferred to the

797
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,720
following account i will capsize five

798
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,480
oil tankers

799
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,960
they just hacked the wrong guy game's

800
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,799
over whoever wrote this needs somebody

801
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,720
to take the fall he's about to commit

802
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,640
the perfect computer crime you've

803
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,279
created a virus that's going to cause a

804
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,919
worldwide disaster and they're about to

805
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,159
take the blame a hacker planted the

806
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:27,120
virus

807
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,540
but it's the perfect cover

808
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,619
[Music]

809
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,039
okay let's nail it

810
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,880

811
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,039
yeah maybe i'm not but we are they're

812
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,640
the only ones who can prevent a

813
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,640
catastrophe i know how to stop this guy

814

seen never send a boy to do a woman's

817
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,960
job hackers of the world unite cops i

818
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,679
need more time this is the end my friend

819
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,919
united artists welcomes you to the new

[Music]

823
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:25,600
makes you want to watch that movie

824
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,679
tonight doesn't matter i bet uh so yeah

825
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:28,960
so just like

826
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,760
matthew broderick as david lightman had

827
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,159
inspired a whole bunch of teenagers to

828
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,720
join bbs's uh when it came to september

829
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,919
15 1995 you know that also inspired an

830
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:41,520
entire generation of hackers as a matter

831
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,679
of fact there are a lot of hackers that

832
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,360
only remember that as kind of being the

833
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,919
start as cheesy as that movie was uh it

834
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,760
actually did become somewhat of a

835
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,200
recruiting tool for people that were

836
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,360
curious about computers

837
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,679
as it became much more accessible but i

838
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,520
actually think that this generation

839
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,440
really started a different day i think

840
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,559
it actually probably started on may 19th

841
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,080
1998.

842
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:08,159
now on may 19th 1998 what happened was

843
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,480
congress had hearings

844
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,320
where they were wanting to talk about

845
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,679
infrastructure

846
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,919
and about

847
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:19,919
cybercrime and about hackers and about

848
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,480
whether they knew it or not bgp

849
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,559
and so they called together a group of

850
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,200
experts uh from loft heavy industries

851
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,919
which was a group of uh folks that were

852
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:31,279
in boston there was a collective for

853
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,919
hardware hacking and software hacking

854
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,840
and they'd had a bbs and they had

855
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,000
websites and they had text files

856
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,919
and so they called this group of people

857
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,919
together to actually ask them some

858
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:43,120
questions now

859
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,399
loft heavy industries was a brain trust

860
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,480
i mean we were talking about the iq

861
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,559
points per capita being just off the

862
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:51,679
charts

863
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,200
and they did a lot of different

864
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,600
exploration but they had recently said

865
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,120
that they could take the entire internet

866
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,360
down so whether we like it or not this

867
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,480
hearing wouldn't have happened if

868
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,760
someone hadn't made the statement i can

869
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,279
take we can any one of us could take the

870
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,360
entire internet down in under 30 minutes

871
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,799
now

872
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,519
that got a lot of people's attention and

873
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,200
i can't recommend enough if you've never

874
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,720
watched the whole thing

875
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,000
that you've got to watch this entire

876
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,840
testimony it's on youtube and we'll link

877
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,159
it in the in the discord etc but here's

878
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,320
just a quick synopsis and just very very

879
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,240
briefly uh some of the highlights from

880
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,399
that testimony

881
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,399
well i thought i did have that but it's

882
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:39,360
not playing okay well anyway um this is

883
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,200
a group of folks that actually talked to

884
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,360
fred thompson the guy from law and order

885
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,640
uh believe it or not i'm not quite sure

886
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,399
where that video is not playing but uh

887
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:47,679
and they were basically that you heard

888
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,279
all these crazy terms that we would know

889
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,120
today was the first time somebody called

890
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,120
hackers rock stars okay they used that

891
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,200
actual term um

892
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,519
it was also the uh the first time that

893
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:58,880
people had actually referred to he was

894
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,440
talking about bgp exploits and

895
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,440
taking down the entire internet uh they

896
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,600
were talking about odays and microsoft's

897
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,519
responsibilities and of course all these

898
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,399
guys grew up and went on to become uh

899
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,240
thought influencers in infosec they're

900
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,320
all on the the uh they're all on twitter

901
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,080
today etc that's out there and i will

902
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,679
link to the shorter video as well i'm

903
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,440
not quite sure what happened there but i

904
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,960
think it's because of kodak issue but

905
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,159
anyway well hopefully that won't happen

906
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,399
again

907
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:28,640
they'll be using their hacker names

908
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,480
of mudge

909
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,840
weld

910
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,080
brian oblivion

911
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,919
kingpin

912
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:37,919
space rogue

913
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,039
tan

914
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:41,360
and stefan i hope my grandkids don't ask

915
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,919
me who my witnesses were today and

916
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,120
especially in light of the fact that the

917
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,640
washington post described you as rock

918
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,720
stars of the computer hacking elite the

919
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,880
person who breaks into the systems

920
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,279
uh and undermines the network security

921
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:56,430
and that's what i do in my day job

922
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:57,760
[Music]

923
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,840
unfortunately many times

924
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,039
they would not improve the software

925
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,320
until we actually went public with the

926
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,720
findings

927
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,000
within 30 minutes the seven of you could

928
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,679
make the internet unusable for the

929
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,120
entire nation

930
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,799
is that correct that's correct actually

931
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:15,360
one of us with just a few packets many

932
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,200
of the problems that are out there that

933
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,320
that contribute to this lack of security

934
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,440
are

935
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,679
are extremely simple

936
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:25,840
buffer overflows are spottable in source

937
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,158
code

938
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,919
in your testimony that

939
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:34,880
given 30 minutes you might be able to

940
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,679
render the internet unusable so what can

941
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:40,559
we do we'll try to protect against that

942
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,279
the um the one the one uh method of

943
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:45,679
doing that that we were referencing uh

944
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,760
there there are several there are dozens

945
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,039
of them actually

946
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,960
this is definitely a double-edged sword

947
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,480
because when you give the information

948
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,919
out right

949
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,600
other people can figure out how to

950
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,880
exploit it

951
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,919
however if you don't give the

952
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,760
information out the people out there

953
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,399
can't protect themselves

954
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:07,519
the first time

955
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,679
some big company

956
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,960
uh has been compromised because of this

957
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,560
that that it may fix itself

958
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,239
indeed the uh

959
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,560
the problem did not fix itself ever as

960
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,159
we just saw recently in colonial

961
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,800
pipeline etc uh this time frame also

962
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,119
started to see a little bit of malicious

963
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,040
behaviors as well the emergence of

964
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,399
something called doxing which was

965
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,399
basically that if you wanted to destroy

966
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,480
someone's online persona

967
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,079
you would publish details about like

968
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,280
what middle school or high school they

969
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,719
went to and who their parents were and

970
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,000
their teachers were

971
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,159
basically dropping pii before we even

972
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,079
knew that term was meant as a punishment

973
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:45,760
for folks and unfortunately doxing is

974
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,960
still around

975
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,280
we saw the emergence of carding

976
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,199
because of text files that basically

977
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,800
taught people how to generate their own

978
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,320
credit cards using a very simple

979
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,440
algorithm

980
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,800
it was also the emergence of the first

981
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,040
denial of service attacks but the

982
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,880
biggest thing ever in this era that

983
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,800
really affects our lives every single

984
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,079
day today

985
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:06,400
was the emergence of the combination of

986
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,320
social engineering and technical

987
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,320
abilities called phishing and it really

988
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,520
started

989
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,920
on america online so again

990
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,520
america online was an online service so

991
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,520
you used to have to pay by the hour for

992
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,320
okay

993
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,760
and people generated programs to spoof

994
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,680
being administrators and just asking

995
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,200
people for their credit cards so you

996
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,280
could use a little script that would

997
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,720
simply ask people your logins and

998
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,440
passwords and it was extremely effective

999
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,960
okay you would get about a ten percent

1000
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,599
return uh using aohel to fish for

1001
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,280
credentials which is pretty close to

1002
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,520
what it is today is if you simply ask

1003
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,119
people for logins and passwords it's a

1004
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:42,960
lot easier than burning o days and

1005
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,480
phishing continues to be

1006
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,760
you know the number one way that

1007
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,440
networks are penetrated across the board

1008
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,680
is almost 90 percent uh every single

1009
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,160
year so we also started to see you know

1010
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,960
the arrival of hacktivism uh

1011
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,880
intellectual property theft it was kind

1012
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,119
of the death of the privacy concept as

1013
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,119
well as the age of the breach but all

1014
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,040
this was driven by the profit motive so

1015
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,640
these criminal gangs started realizing

1016
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,480
that they could actually make money

1017
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,240
and that really drove and underdrove the

1018
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,480
entire fourth generation now the fifth

1019
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,079
generation emerged and it kind of

1020
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:13,599
overlaps with the fourth you could argue

1021
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:14,720
that we're still in that fourth

1022
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,119
generation because of the profit motive

1023
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,800
but the fifth generation is summarized

1024
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,520
best by saying you know that the the the

1025
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,079
cold war ended but the cyber war began

1026
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:25,280
and actually the cyber ward kind of

1027
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,520
begun before the cold war ended but

1028
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,320
really when you think about key dates

1029
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,240
2011 is probably the one that people

1030
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,640
believe this is when this really started

1031
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,800
and what happened in 2011 was that the

1032
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,320
united states and israel launched the

1033
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,560
world's most advanced cyber weapon

1034
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,839
pointed at iran designed to knock off

1035
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:44,720
three

1036
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,880
nuclear power facilities

1037
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,839
using a very advanced

1038
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:51,280
polymorphic

1039
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,680
worm that was meant with one intent and

1040
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,280
that was to destroy someone else's

1041
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,880
facilities this was the first time a

1042
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,320
peaceful nation had ever attacked

1043
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,560
another peaceful nation without ever

1044
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,000
actually saying you know this is an

1045
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,920
attack because it was stealthy and it

1046
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,320
had a lot of massive innovations in it

1047
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,920
the code could change itself if it was

1048
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,400
detected it was multi-platform it could

1049
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,079
hop what we called the air gap at the

1050
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,680
time everyone thought you couldn't have

1051
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,040
code that could jump air gaps but it

1052
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,599
used usb sticks to do that and it was

1053
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,000
very very specifically targeted at one

1054
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,560
particular area now the problem with

1055
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,280
this and this became known as stuxnet

1056
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,880
primarily because of the first five or

1057
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,880
six bytes of it uh was an anagram at the

1058
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,119
beginning uh it became known as stuxnet

1059
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:33,520
and it got out and it spread

1060
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,960
and it didn't destroy things all over

1061
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,440
the world but it taught people a lot of

1062
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,359
things about how to build these there's

1063
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:40,880
lots and lots and lots of secrets around

1064
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,119
this it contains several odays and this

1065
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:45,280
is how it was covered at the time

1066
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,200
last year a computer virus called

1067
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,280
stuxnet was discovered lurking in the

1068
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,440
data banks of power plants traffic

1069
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,839
control systems and factories around the

1070
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,480
world 20 times more complex than any

1071
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,800
previous virus code it had an array of

1072
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,280
capabilities among them the ability to

1073
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,040
turn up the pressure inside nuclear

1074
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,400
reactors or switch off oil pipelines and

1075
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,640
stuxnet could tell the system operators

1076
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,760
everything was normal

1077
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,160
unlike most viruses stuxnet doesn't

1078
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,079
carry the usual forged security

1079
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,000
clearance that helps viruses burrow into

1080
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,280
systems

1081
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,920
it actually had a real clearance stolen

1082
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,680
from one of the most reputable computer

1083
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,880
technology companies in the world

1084
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,119
it exploited security gaps that system

1085
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,839
creators are unaware of

1086
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:34,480
these holes are known as zero days and

1087
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,440
the most successful viruses exploit them

1088
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,520
the details of a zero day can be sold on

1089
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,359
the black market for a hundred thousand

1090
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:44,800
dollars stuxnet took advantage of twenty

1091
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,119
zero days looking to shut down

1092
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,119
the centrifuges that spin nuclear

1093
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:53,440
material at iran's enrichment facilities

1094
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,240
stuxnet was a weapon the first to be

1095
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,760
made entirely out of code

1096
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,760
the most important question may not be

1097
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,119
who designed it but who will redesign it

1098
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,520
the evolution has been so fast that nine

1099
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,839
months after its detection the first

1100
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,760
virus that could crash power grids or

1101
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,079
destroy oil pipelines is available

1102
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:16,480
online for anyone to download and tinker

1103
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,440
with it's an open source weapon

1104
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,040
and there's no way of knowing who will

1105
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,800
use it or what they will use it for

1106
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,960
of course do we now know exactly what

1107
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,440
those uh oh days were that were actually

1108
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,440
deployed uh and well you know what the

1109
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,960
effect of this but this was of course

1110
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,720
nation state actors this was the first

1111
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,720
time we really saw the emergence of

1112
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,800
nation state actors on the global stage

1113
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,880
and by the way with this term nation

1114
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,400
state actors just a tip

1115
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,160
you never use an acronym for this

1116
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,520
because if you use that acronym it means

1117
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,839
something else completely

1118
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:49,200
but that's that's actually government

1119
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,960
groups or government finance groups that

1120
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,040
are actually you know causing harm and

1121
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,200
really this built up to november 24th

1122
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,000
2014

1123
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,240
when all of the employees at sony

1124
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,920
pictures entertainment came into work

1125
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,920
one day and saw that their computers had

1126
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,280
been wiped

1127
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,000
and replaced with a somewhat badly

1128
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,400
written threatening message

1129
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,560
basically causing mass destruction at

1130
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,480
sony pictures entertainment now there

1131
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,839
are some lessons that should be learned

1132
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:18,800
here the biggest one is the asymmetrical

1133
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,119
nature of cyber warfare which is

1134
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,200
basically a military term that says one

1135
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,520
side is unevenly matched but can cause

1136
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,280
equal amount of damage so if you can

1137
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,640
cause me a million dollars with the

1138
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,040
damage for 100 bucks of your expenditure

1139
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,480
that's going to be asymmetrical because

1140
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,000
it's going to cost me so much more to

1141
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,440
defend

1142
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,520
so not only was it asymmetrical but

1143
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,680
sony's chief of security had actually

1144
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,119
made the mistake

1145
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:44,079
of telling people that hey listen uh i'm

1146
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:46,160
not gonna invest 10 million bucks to try

1147
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,000
to prevent every breach because what's

1148
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,119
the worst thing that could happen it

1149
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,800
could be a million dollar loss

1150
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,800
and of course we know it was closer to

1151
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,119
800 million dollars when it was all said

1152
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,040
and done and that actually speaks to the

1153
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,599
fact that uh risk assessment is hard to

1154
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:01,440
do right just like attribution it can be

1155
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,200
very difficult to do

1156
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,119
but sony also had a lesson to be learned

1157
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:07,839
about alarms because they had fire eye

1158
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,720
they had a cisco they had david palo

1159
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,960
alto they had a ton of alarms going off

1160
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,240
right some people say it was over ten

1161
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,920
thousand alarms

1162
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,520
but they were ignoring them because when

1163
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,680
you get that many alarms you get alarm

1164
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,440
fatigue or you just basically filter

1165
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,440
them out and they didn't even catch the

1166
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,200
x-fil either that's when the data was

1167
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,480
being moved we're talking about almost a

1168
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,440
terabyte of very very personal data

1169
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,000
scripts movie files just basically the

1170
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,240
most nightmare scenario ever for an

1171
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,680
entertainment company

1172
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,000
but the nightmare continued because they

1173
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,240
also suffered reputational damage it

1174
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,240
turned out that all the sony employees

1175
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,880
kept all of their email in unencrypted

1176
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,440
pst files that was their method of uh

1177
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,599
keeping records and so the emails

1178
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:51,520
started being leaked and these were

1179
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,000
extremely destructive to people's

1180
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,599
personalities it really highlighted the

1181
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:57,520
pay gap between uh men and women in

1182
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,000
hollywood there was a lot of

1183
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,599
a lot of intolerance that was expressed

1184
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,880
in there this is one of the ones that's

1185
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,319
like a two in the morning email that

1186
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:05,920
maybe you wouldn't necessarily want the

1187
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,480
world to see actually costing

1188
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,960
their ceo uh her job ultimately at the

1189
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,920
end of the day because of that

1190
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,599
reputational damage

1191
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:16,720
in addition sony also taught us that the

1192
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,240
the hackers left behind a file called

1193
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,920
bonus.rar

1194
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,400
that listed all of the passwords

1195
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,480
on the network and their passwords were

1196
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,680
horrible

1197
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,319
17 people had used sony 123.

1198
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:29,440
there was a lot of people that had

1199
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,000
password sony and sony password uh and

1200
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,440
ultimately at the end of the day even

1201
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,960
though they were audited even though

1202
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,119
past the audit process uh they were

1203
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,760
using very very easy to guess passwords

1204
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,599
now the whole world was watching this

1205
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:43,359
president obama talked about it it was

1206
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:45,280
all over the news everyone knew that we

1207
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,640
needed to strengthen up our cyber

1208
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,040
security so the question is is did

1209
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,200
anyone learn well we don't have to

1210
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,800
wonder because this guy did a little bit

1211
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,319
of research and this is what he found

1212
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:56,560
two weeks after the sony breach

1213
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,160
today we sent a camera out on hollywood

1214
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,960
blvd to help people by asking them to

1215
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,640
tell us their password and

1216
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,720
this is how that went we're talking

1217
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,520
about cyber security today and how safe

1218
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,440
people's passwords are what is one of

1219
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,000
your online passwords currently it is my

1220

1228
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,280
it's like my cat's name and then just

1229
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,760
like a random number okay have you had

1230
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,520
this cat for a while yeah she's my

1231
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,000
childhood pet oh and what's her name her

1232
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,160
name is jolie jolie

1233
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,760
so like a password of yours would be

1234
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,760
jolie and then a number yeah like number

1235
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,720

6

1239
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,200
12. 95.

1240
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,359
so i think you you kind of get the uh

1241
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:03,040
the gist of that and that is that people

1242
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,720
even then were using very very easy

1243
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,480
passwords and it was easy to social

1244
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,359
engineer them um out but there was this

1245
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:11,119
explosion of apt groups that's what

1246
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:12,480
they're called advanced persistent

1247
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,800
threat groups uh with lots of lots of

1248
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,800
interesting names and numbers uh the

1249
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,480
north korean group that did sony was

1250
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,640
actually came to be known as lazarus but

1251
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,720
there's also a huge group of these that

1252
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,240
you could actually find if you go to

1253
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:28,319
apt.threattracking.com there's a there's

1254
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,160
a very very extensive spreadsheet and

1255
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,800
list at

1256
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,680
apt.threattracking.com that actually

1257
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,760
gives you very up-to-date collaborative

1258
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,599
information and the one that most people

1259
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:40,480
think about a lot is apt-1

1260
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,119
which is uh in the people's liberation

1261
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:46,319
army 61-398 which is housed in this

1262
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:48,079
specific building that they call an

1263
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:50,960
apartment complex but when you approach

1264
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,800
that apartment complex

1265
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,400
you rapidly see

1266
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,400
that it is not exactly like any other

1267
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,400
apartment complex you've seen before

1268
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,480
because the security forces are armed

1269
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,480
and will chase you down the street

1270
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,200
if you get if you get too close and so

1271
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:09,040
that ultimately that group the apt-1 was

1272
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,839
tied to some major breaches like anthem

1273
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:15,040
healthcare probably equifax and of

1274
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,040
course the opm which is the office of

1275
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,040
personnel management office of personnel

1276
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,599
management budget opm was the government

1277
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:24,720
source that kept track of uh

1278
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,240
both clearance people that were applying

1279
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,319
for clearance and their references so

1280
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:30,720
there was a lot of very very deep pii in

1281
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,800
the opm data breach for anyone that had

1282
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,200
sought security clearances and also

1283
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,720
their neighbors and relatives that they

1284
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,920
put down you know basically as a list

1285
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,240
this built up that type of particular

1286
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,079
breach built up to something called

1287
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,240
equifax which was one of the biggest and

1288
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,000
worst ones in the united states because

1289
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,160
it probably contained your data most

1290
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,920
likely it did contain your data

1291
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,640
fortunately or unfortunately equifax

1292
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,240
wasn't dumped to the world it was

1293
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,560
weaponized for other purposes right so

1294
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,880
that we know for a fact that this was

1295
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,640
most likely china because the fact that

1296
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,920
none of it has really gotten out they

1297
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,319
want to just hoard that data and use it

1298
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:08,960
uh basically for uh recruitment or

1299
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,200
extortion or to know whether somebody's

1300
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,839
uh hidden or not then of course

1301
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:16,079
everything escalated very much when we

1302
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:18,240
talked about as the election approached

1303
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,280
the dnc breach which was

1304
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,640
probably something that you were sick

1305
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:23,920
and tired of ever hearing about but

1306
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,839
ultimately was a group of russian

1307
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:26,800
hackers

1308
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,599
that began just like most of them begin

1309
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:31,760
with fishing now most people think that

1310
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,079
this really the origin of a lot of this

1311
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:36,079
was the podesta fish

1312
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:37,920
not quite there's a little bit more to

1313
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,119
it than that

1314
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:41,280
but the podesta fish was actually

1315
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,920
um relatively sophisticated i know it's

1316
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,599
very popular to make fun of the users or

1317
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:47,839
the user shame on phishing but if you

1318
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:50,160
look at what he actually clicked it

1319
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,000
actually looked like it came from google

1320
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:52,960
okay

1321
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,200
and it actually had his photo and his

1322
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,119
profile embedded in there

1323
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,440
right and it looked like it came from it

1324
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,680
was a security alert and so of course he

1325
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:02,880
called his security guy and said this

1326
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,720
seems weird and the security guy said

1327
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,640
yeah click click and reset your password

1328
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,640
right now but what he didn't tell him

1329
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,280
was don't click the link they gave you

1330
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,599
go to go to the main google page and

1331
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:16,079
reset it from there and so we mostly

1332
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:17,839
know the rest of the story around the

1333
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:22,759
dnc side because of the

1334
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,440
foreign

1335
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,920
okay i think we're back there that was a

1336
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,200
little bit of the russians not wanting

1337
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,720
to have us have this discussion i

1338
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,040
suppose um that was the uh

1339
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,839
that was the concern that's there um i'm

1340
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:55,920
not quite sure where it cut off so i'm

1341
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,359
just gonna back up for just a second and

1342
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:58,960
say the shadow brokers were trying to

1343
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,160
embarrass

1344
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,319
the uh

1345
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:03,599
the usa

1346
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:05,920
uh and ultimately the release of the

1347
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:09,119
tools that led to some very advanced

1348
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:12,000
weapons uh using things like eternal

1349
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,599
blue uh and uh you know a lot a lot of

1350
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:17,280
the tools that were leaked by the shadow

1351
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,319
brokers became part of ransomware in the

1352
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:21,599
future

1353
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,599
uh let me just verify real quick that my

1354
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:27,119
sound is coming through at one second

1355
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,359
all right so ultimately these are

1356
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:34,000
advanced hacking tools and uh you know

1357
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,960
this became kind of a war of escalation

1358
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,720
uh between kind of trying to embarrass

1359
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,119
the united states uh trying to wreak

1360
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:43,200
havoc et cetera and we know who shadow

1361
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,720
brokers were i mean it wasn't exactly

1362
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,720
it's not exactly nuclear science to try

1363
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,800
to speculate who that was um and

1364
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,720
ultimately that led to

1365
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,599
uh not petya to wannacry to a lot of the

1366
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:55,280
really bad attacks that most of you

1367
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,720
probably remember because it really

1368
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,800
wasn't that long ago

1369
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:59,760
at all

1370
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,400
ultimately leading up to wannacry

1371
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,319
and that actually being killed by a

1372
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:07,040
sinkhole so when we think about the

1373
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,520
fifth generation defenses what those

1374
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,920
fifth generation defenses were was you

1375
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,240
know ultimately at the end of the day we

1376
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,880
have to as cyber security professionals

1377
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,359
defend from an incredibly diverse uh

1378
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,839
threat landscape it includes uh script

1379
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:23,760
kitties uh there's a there's a

1380
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,680
significant labor shortage that are out

1381
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,079
there it has nation states uh

1382
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:30,880
sophisticated cyber gangs uh you know

1383
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,319
all of these types of things and it's

1384
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:36,000
very difficult to defend from that range

1385
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,359
of of of opponents right and so what

1386
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:40,640
we're doing is we're always looking for

1387
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,640
magic bullets now i'm not going to say

1388
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,160
blockchain because i have to pay a fine

1389
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,079
if i use that word on a slide but

1390
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:47,520
certainly a lot of people are thinking

1391
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,040
about machine learning

1392
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,880
and artificial intelligence

1393
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,440
the problem with those types of defenses

1394
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,000
is that the biggest challenge we have

1395
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,760
out in the marketplace is not

1396
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,079
necessarily artificial intelligence

1397
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:03,359
i mean you can have an absolutely uh

1398
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:06,079
huge budget uh that could have all kinds

1399
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:07,920
of components to it that has you know

1400
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,680
all kinds of uh you know

1401
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,680
nist conformance everything else at the

1402
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,440
end of the day that's not going to do

1403
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,359
you any good at all if people are still

1404
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:17,920
reusing their passwords which is the

1405
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,000
number one or number two problem from

1406
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,839
data breaches is that people are still

1407
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:23,680
using the yahoo passwords in the

1408
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,319
linkedin database to penetrate systems

1409
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:28,720
that are in production today and we know

1410
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,880
that most that a very large percentage

1411
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,520
of people continue to reuse their same

1412
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,440
passwords and the reason we know that is

1413
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,960
because you can do surveys but you can

1414
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,040
also just check for yourself in many

1415
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,800
cases if you have

1416
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,040
uh the the password databases that the

1417
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,880
same ones the criminals are

1418
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,040
so we know what the answer is the answer

1419
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:50,160
around this is really to bring about

1420
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,240
strong passwords uh to bring about

1421
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,240
multi-factor authentication and make

1422
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,720
people more situationally aware on

1423
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,800
fishing but there's a bigger problem

1424
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,319
that we're facing today and it's not

1425
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:02,640
necessarily a covet problem but it is a

1426
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,720
covet era problem

1427
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,000
and that is

1428
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,319
a lot of the folks that would like to

1429
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:10,480
see us fail when i say us i mean the

1430
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,480
cyber security community

1431
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,480
and anybody that believes in freedom and

1432
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:15,680
information

1433
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,400
uh are also facing influence operations

1434
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,200
so

1435
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,720
the 2016 election uh meddling was

1436
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,640
destructive it was definitely had a big

1437
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:25,680
impact

1438
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,440
on a lot of different things but the

1439
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:30,960
2020 was actually worse because in 2020

1440
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,839
those uh the the same types of forces

1441
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:35,760
that were trying to sow discord we're

1442
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,319
using a lot more legitimate channels

1443
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:40,960
to do so so one of the biggest ideas is

1444
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,559
to find places where people are

1445
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:45,280
fractured and basically provoke people

1446
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,960
to fight amongst themselves the classic

1447
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,440
example in 16 was the black lives matter

1448
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,760
movement the russians would stage

1449
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,960
basically

1450
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,880
protests and counter protests on

1451
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,800
facebook to get people to show up and

1452
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,200
argue about an issue that is you know

1453
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,280
particularly contentious this is

1454
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,599
fighting a lot of disinformation a lot

1455
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:05,680
of fake news in the real sense of fake

1456
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:06,480
news

1457
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,319
that's out there to cause americans to

1458
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,240
fight each other basically

1459
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,559
and this also happens all over the world

1460
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:15,040
as well we see that with brexit we see

1461
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,440
that with covenanted vaccinations etc

1462
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,240
and so this is the way that active

1463
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,720
measures are done first and foremost

1464
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,640
create a big lie right once you have a

1465
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,800
big huge lie everything can revolve

1466
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,800
around that big huge lie and it has to

1467
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,520
be bold and it has to be repeated often

1468
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,359
so if you hear a big lie that is

1469
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:34,640
repeated often

1470
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,079
then you know that that may be part of

1471
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:37,920
an influence operation

1472
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,400
deny absolutely everything and play the

1473
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,559
long game of course you want influential

1474
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:44,400
useful idiots that are there this can

1475
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,880
cause discord in a community like an

1476
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,680
infosec community or the ic or nato it

1477
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:50,800
doesn't matter what the size of the

1478
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,800
organization is this is how you can

1479
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,800
actually sew dissent and there's a great

1480
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,119
movie by thomas ridge on active measures

1481
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:00,240
about this that really talks about it

1482
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,599
at the end of the day

1483
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:03,359
causing groups to basically destroy

1484
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:05,760
themselves from within by spreading

1485
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,760
rumors and disinformation is an

1486
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,200
extremely effective way to do that now

1487
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,480
i'm not saying that the russians have

1488
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,680
penetrated the infosec twitters and are

1489
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,079
putting up stock puppets to try to cause

1490
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:20,000
people to have fights

1491
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,440
i'm not saying they aren't either by the

1492
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,760
way i mean the u.s certainly did that we

1493
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,079
certainly had influence operations on

1494
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:28,400
other countries uh web forums you know

1495
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,760
basically to try to drive things all

1496
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,000
right but i am saying that there is a

1497
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,319
lot of discord and a lot of

1498
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:36,800
splintering and polarization that is not

1499
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,960
necessarily helpful to the cause so when

1500
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,960
we think in terms of you know when i go

1501
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,200
back and i think in terms of uh the

1502
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,359
entire architecture around this this

1503
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:47,200
this talk and this description

1504
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,559
is you know was there five generations

1505
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,000
of hacking

1506
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:50,880
well

1507
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,000
i would actually say there's five

1508
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,240
generations of hackers right this is

1509
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,400
those are time frames about basically

1510
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,400
when you discovered hacking when you

1511
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,880
discovered uh the exploration side of

1512
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,280
that but at the end of the day right now

1513
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,920
us together here we're the sixth

1514
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,920
generation okay

1515
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,480
we are being called upon now or i'm

1516
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,800
calling upon you to hack the infosec

1517
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:13,920
community

1518
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,920
let me show you something

1519
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,040
this is seven years ago

1520
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,800
by the way does anyone know left to

1521
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,200
right who's in that photo pop it in the

1522
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,559
discord if you can name the people left

1523
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:26,640
to right

1524
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:30,000
and this is uh two year two years ago

1525
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,280
again left to right if you can name the

1526
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,359
photos right

1527
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:35,200
and so you can see that there's been a

1528
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,280
lot of growth and fun and development in

1529
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:38,880
this circle city con crew that's out

1530
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,880
there and this is where we are today

1531
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,319
right when i look out across the

1532
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:44,799
landscape of infosec i see people that

1533
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:47,119
are fatigued they're covered fatigued

1534
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:48,640
they're alarm fatigue they're outraged

1535
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:49,839
fatigued because there's always a new

1536
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:51,599
outrage of the day there's a little bit

1537
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:52,960
of burnout actually there's a lot of

1538
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,760
burnout and being fractured

1539
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,440
and that is not when we're at our

1540
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,079
strongest okay that is not when we as a

1541
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:03,359
group can face this unique adversary

1542
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:05,760
landscape that is challenging all of us

1543
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,920
and so to hack the infosec community i

1544
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,400
would suggest we got to address burnout

1545
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,119
we're going to have real good mentorship

1546
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:14,880
encouraging cooperation

1547
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,480
and then the most important part of all

1548
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,839
is we have to pursue diversity and

1549
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:21,119
inclusiveness now i won't get into it a

1550
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:22,640
lot because i ran out of time on the

1551
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,640
technical issue side but just some of

1552
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:25,760
the things i would recommend you look

1553
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,200
into if you're not familiar with any of

1554
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:30,000
this is tonya jenka has an incredible

1555
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,160
amount of material around

1556
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,760
mentorship and she started cyber

1557
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,280
mentoring mondays

1558
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,240
um uh she is uh she hacks purple and we

1559
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:40,240
hack purple on on twitter

1560
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,480
uh infosec sherpa has a great talk

1561
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,040
called uh empathy is the service which

1562
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,720
is really about how to learn and grow

1563
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,799
empathy and then there's just a huge a

1564
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:50,640
lot things around the fact that

1565
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,640
diversities are strength if you have two

1566
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,720
teams together and one has diversity of

1567
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,480
backgrounds and thoughts and one is

1568
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,079
completely you know from the same exact

1569
00:55:58,079 --> 00:55:59,760
backgrounds that first team is going to

1570
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,400
win every single time diversity makes us

1571
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,040
stronger we need more diverse voices we

1572
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,960
need more newbies we need more people

1573
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,440
from all different types of backgrounds

1574
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,960
all across the place because it'll make

1575
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,640
us better not just because it's the

1576
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,640
right thing to do which it is but also

1577
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:17,119
because it will make us stronger and

1578
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:18,799
better that's out there so what i would

1579
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:20,880
say to do in the sixth generation is

1580
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,119
let's smash those gates okay let's lower

1581
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:24,640
the ladders

1582
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,480
let's support those newbies let's reach

1583
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,319
out and really try to bring in more

1584
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:30,559
people to help fight the good fight so

1585
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:32,880
to speak and let's destroy bigotry out

1586
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,640
there just don't put up with it at all

1587
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,319
that ultimately will be increasing

1588
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:38,480
diversity and inclusion and this is how

1589
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,160
we're going to be able to address

1590
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,240
those issues that we go forward in the

1591
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:45,760
post covered era of the sixth generation

1592
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,240
now are you up for it

1593
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,558
are you

1594

1598
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:01,200
me for this time frame i apologize for

1599
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:02,640
the technical issues

1600
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,240
i will actually be joining circle

1601
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,640
