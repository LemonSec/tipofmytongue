[Music]

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,840
wow

3
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:22,039
[Music]

4
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,480
hello and thank you for joining me my

5
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,960
name is kathy ullman i'm also known as

6
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,719
investigator chick and we're going to

7
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,880
talk about communicating

8
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,160
during an incident so many of us i think

9
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,480
are familiar with incidents

10
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,079
whether they're small or something

11
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,360
really big

12
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,239
pretty sure if you haven't been paying

13
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,160
attention uh

14
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,160
you know you might not have seen stuff

15
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,280
about maybe

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,440
solar winds because that's not a thing

17
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,239
right

18
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:57,680
so we're going to talk a little bit

19
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,920
about communicating when you do have an

20
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,399
incident because we do talk a lot about

21
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,879
incidents uh in terms of recovering from

22
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,280
them and preventing them but not so much

23
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,400
about communicating during them

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,799
so here's our agenda we're going to meet

25
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,080
the sloth

26
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,560
we'll talk about why this particular

27
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,240
subject matters

28
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,080
we'll talk a little about our strengths

29
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,080
and weaknesses in infosec there are some

30
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,560
things we are incredibly good at doing

31
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,159
and there are some things that we could

32
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,640
use some help with and how those

33
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,520
particular things help or detract us

34
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,200
from this goal

35
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,280
then we'll talk about communication at

36
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,280
multiple levels so

37
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,439
you will need to communicate in an

38
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,600
organization up the chain down the chain

39
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,799
sideways

40
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,159
so we're going to talk about how that

41
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,759
communication differs

42
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,159
we'll talk a little about non-verbal

43
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,240
communications because that's just as

44
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,880
important as our verbal communication

45
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,399
and then i'll give you some final

46
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,719
thoughts

47
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,560
so here we go

48
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,560
meeting the sloth

49
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,159
so this is a slot from the buffalo zoo

50
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,598
where i adopted him uh

51
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,599
it's been almost two years now his name

52
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,879
is flash

53
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,560
he's very sweet and i'm very fond of

54
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,640
sloths so i i almost always bring a

55
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,440
sloth to the party uh figuratively of

56
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,959
course

57
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,360
this is a little about me i won't dwell

58
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,239
on this i have some degrees i have some

59
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,319
certifications i help out with a whole

60
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,840
bunch of stuff

61
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,480
and uh you know so if you want to know

62
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,920
more about me

63
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,080
you are welcome to google and read more

64
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,680
about this

65
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,200
i want to bring

66
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,280
hacking is not a crime to your attention

67
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,879
very briefly

68
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,560
i think this is a very important

69
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,440
organization the idea being that you

70
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,519
know those of us who are hackers

71
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,920
what we do inherently is not a crime

72
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,720
however the intent can change that right

73
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,760
so if you're interested i recommend you

74
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,440
check us out at hacking is not a

75
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,080
crime.org

76
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,440
moving on

77
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,480
so let's get into the meat potatoes of

78
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,400
this conversation

79
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,200
so motivation why should we care about

80
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,360
this subject

81
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,080
well this cat is very interested clearly

82
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,760
but what are the odds

83
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,280
and this isn't this is not meant

84
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,400
to be the the scary slide it's really

85
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,640
just meant to point out the fact that

86
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,879
you know we can see patterns right

87
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,120
there have been a number of breaches and

88
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,280
in 2018 to 19 we see breaches going up

89
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,560
and then from 2019 to 2020

90
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,200
gee the total number of breaches go down

91
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,440
so is that good does that mean things

92
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,959
are getting better

93
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,640
maybe

94
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,959
but i would say

95
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,280
oh i don't know maybe it's just the kind

96
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,760
of breaches that we're having and

97
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,959
the way in which attackers are coming

98
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,879
after our information

99
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,640
is now focused more on something like

100
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,159
ransomware

101
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,879
so the point of this slide is just to

102
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,000
point out

103
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,239
that there is an increased frequency of

104
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,640
ransomware as i mentioned earlier the

105
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,959
whole business with solarwinds

106
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,798
and all the things that have made the

107
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,279
news lately have typically been some

108
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,959
form of ransomware

109
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,520
so maybe we're not losing a gazillion

110
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,520
records at a time

111
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,120
maybe instead

112
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,400
we're being forced to deal with

113
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,000
ransomware and that's certainly a

114
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,600
pattern that's going up

115
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,400
so the reality is that

116
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,840
everybody's going to be dealing with

117
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,400
incidents

118
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,160
so this is a quote

119
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,639
from the former fbi director

120
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,000
and

121
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,320
he argues that there's really only two

122
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,639
kinds of companies those who've been

123
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,280
hacked and those who will be and

124
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,800
ultimately

125
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,560
those who will be hacked

126
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,479
and those who will be hacked again right

127
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,639
and so the reality is

128
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,240
this is everywhere

129
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,080
we're going to have an incident at some

130
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,039
point

131
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:03,919
and

132
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,560
really if we take some time and we think

133
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,320
through how we're going to communicate

134
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,039
during that incident we will be better

135
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,280
prepared to deal with whatever comes

136
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,840
down the pike instead of being in a

137
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,919
fearful tizzy running around like

138
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,039
chickens with their heads cut off

139
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,160
all right so this leads into our

140
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,280
strengths and weaknesses in infosec

141
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,160
so as i mentioned earlier

142
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,560
folks who do this job

143
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,960
tend to be really good at certain things

144
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,120
right what are we good at

145
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,680
first of all i want to point out

146
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,320
that the reality is

147
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,479
while technology can play a role in

148
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,360
solving some of the problems we see

149
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,000
like you know ransomware any other sort

150
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,880
of

151
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,479
attack

152
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,120
really we're dealing with people

153
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,919
and

154
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,199
i.t folks infosec folks not always so

155
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,039
good at dealing with people

156
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,120
so if you really want to understand the

157
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,960
security problem you have to realize

158
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,520
it's a people problem

159
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,080
so how does that tie back into this

160
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,919
notion of what we're good at and what

161
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,639
we're not good at

162
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,479
well here's what we're really good at

163
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:17,919
doing

164
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:18,840
we

165
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,240
are exceptional at fixing problems right

166
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,000
just like this little kitten we can

167
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,440
solve all the problems you've got to

168
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,919
break we fix it

169
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,840
especially in the defense universe i

170
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,400
mean you know the offense folks they

171
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,479
like to break things defense folks have

172
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,720
to figure out how to fix them although i

173
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,280
have to give kudos we are starting to

174
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,080
see some folks in the offensive space

175
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,319
providing you know just as much

176
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,720
usable information and intel about how

177
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,400
they broke something to be able to help

178
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,400
fix it which is fantastic

179
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,800
so this is an area in which we really

180
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,680
excel in general in the i.t space and in

181
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,319
infosec

182
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,120
this is unfortunately what we're not so

183
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,560
good at

184
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,280
we do not excel at communicating with

185
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,840
each other or with other people

186
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,560
and some of you may recognize this this

187
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,520
image

188
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,080
i would play a clip for you but the the

189
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,639
clips some of them are a little grainy

190
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,360
but this clip is from an old saturday

191
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,120
night live skit

192
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,240
with

193
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,000
uh

194
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,720
this particular gentleman on the right

195
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,160
plays nick burns the computer guy and

196
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,720
what he does when he shows up at your

197
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,880
desk as the worker person who's trying

198
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,400
to get help

199
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,720
is he belittles them he talks down to

200
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,960
them and he says move

201
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,319
right

202
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,360
if you're the person whose job it is

203
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,280
to do the thing

204
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,720
you are there

205
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,759
to

206
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,879
write a word document that describes a

207
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,879
project that your organization is

208
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,080
involved in

209
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,080
you're not there to do technical support

210
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,599
you rely

211
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,599
on those of us in i.t

212
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,160
and in security to support you in some

213
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,199
way well nick is terrible at that and

214
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,160
unfortunately he represents a large

215
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,560
chunk of us right

216
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,160
i would like to think i'm not in that

217
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,599
chunk i've made a career out of going

218
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,759
out of my way to try to explain things

219
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,080
in terms that folks who are not

220
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,840
technical understand

221
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,240
i came out of a support role before i

222
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,879
moved into security i was in support for

223
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,640
a very long time i started on the phones

224
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,679
in a call center like many folks have i

225
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,599
did word perfect support

226
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,000
and you know these people they rely on

227
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,240
you for help in the same way that we

228
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,360
rely on other folks in other industries

229
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,320
plumbers electricians any sort of

230
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,720
industry you can think of

231
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,399
where we don't necessarily have that

232
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,080
expertise

233
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,560
so when we do a poor job of

234
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,360
communicating with folks

235
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,600
we set ourselves up for failure and

236
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,440
that's a problem and it's especially a

237
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,959
problem during an incident

238
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,200
so patience

239
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,839
they say

240
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,240
is not something that we often have a

241
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,440
whole lot of

242
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,000
it's something that is hard to come by

243
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,720
and you know i i have felt this very

244
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,640
angry way on occasion

245
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,040
and that's really hard because when you

246
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,360
have to explain something for the

247
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,160
20th 30th time

248
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,920
you don't really want to have to explain

249
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,440
it again and yet

250
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,000
that is part of our job right is that we

251
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,839
have to explain things we often have to

252
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,480
explain them more than once

253
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,800
so what are the repercussions of us not

254
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,720
communicating well

255
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,399
with these folks

256
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,200
well

257
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,440
there can be a loss of trust and in

258
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,720
reality

259
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,360
the security office in an organization

260
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,279
or even if you just have you know some

261
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,240
folks who are in a role if there's no

262
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,839
big organization

263
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,640
because this talk is meant to cover you

264
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,040
whether you're in a tiny organization

265
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,959
maybe you're it right you're the only

266
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,279
person in the job doing i.t and security

267
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,079
and you you wear all the hats right

268
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,360
or maybe

269
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,360
you're in a large organization where

270
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,120
there is a full security office and a

271
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,880
whole bunch of people doing all kinds of

272
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,720
other types of support

273
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,240
it doesn't matter

274
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,000
what matters is that when you don't

275
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,399
communicate well with people

276
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,040
you can lose their trust and if they

277
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,279
don't trust you they won't tell you when

278
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,800
something's wrong

279
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,720
and think about what happens if you

280
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,959
don't know something's wrong right

281
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,720
the folks who are out there are eyes and

282
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,360
ears we can look at logs all day long

283
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,120
but in many cases

284
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,320
the log tells us the bigger picture or

285
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,800
can tip us off to some other piece but

286
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,440
maybe just maybe it's that individual

287
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,240
who says i see something weird and that

288
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,399
individual could either be

289
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,480
somebody in the

290
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,000
i.t space the infosec space or none of

291
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,279
the above

292
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,399
so it's important to keep their trust

293
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,160
future communications will also be

294
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,720
problematic if i'm uncomfortable talking

295
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,600
to you

296
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,279
because you've belittled me or you've

297
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,600
talked down to me in some way

298
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,120
i'm not going to want to pick up that

299
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,800
phone and call you right i'm going to

300
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,279
call somebody else for help and maybe

301
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,120
that person wasn't the best choice to

302
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,720
call because maybe they don't have all

303
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,920
the insight

304
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,480
so this is really important um you can

305
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,800
be the cause of an additional conflict

306
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,519
because again you know now you maybe

307
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,760
they had a different phone call they

308
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,279
called somebody else and that person

309
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,680
gave them inaccurate information now you

310
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,600
have another conflict

311
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,720
there can be

312
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,079
in general

313
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,920
bad reputation

314
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,200
vibes

315
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,720
uh on a company if that communication

316
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,639
about an incident in particular is poor

317
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,560
we've seen a lot of that right the

318
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,600
intern did it that caused all kinds of

319
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,000
fantastic thumbs up i don't know about

320
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,120
you but i

321
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,360
really wasn't particularly happy to see

322
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,639
that

323
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,480
there's going to be an overall increase

324
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,000
decrease in morale because when people

325
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,839
don't feel good about who they're

326
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,279
working with and they don't feel like

327
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,360
they can communicate with you especially

328
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,839
during an incident

329
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,440
they're not going to feel good about

330
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,600
where they are what they're doing and of

331
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,680
course it's going to lead to additional

332
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,839
stress

333
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,800
so i'm going to use an example here

334
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,360
that is pretty basic

335
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,800
as you might guess it's going to be a

336
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,120
ransomware type example i'm not going to

337
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,000
go into the specifics of the particulars

338
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,680
of the ransomware

339
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,839
i'm just going to show you

340
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:42,639
some

341
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,399
common examples right everything from

342
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,639
wannacry to the solar winds

343
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,680
uh you know the point is that all of

344
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,040
these kinds of things now can lead to

345
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,200
some form of ransomware where either our

346
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,680
data becomes encrypted or it becomes a

347
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,279
situation where

348
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,279
the attacker first

349
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,360
steals a bunch of data and then offers

350
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,680
it back to you for a ransom so it really

351
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,519
becomes more of extortion

352
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,519
so the details aren't important what is

353
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,639
important here is i'm setting up a basic

354
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:13,920
incident

355
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,760
so we've had an incident happen one of

356
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,279
these things has popped up on on a

357
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,120
machine somebody notices something

358
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,279
really strange has happened

359
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,920
so you know the question at that point

360
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,079
becomes what do we do now

361
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,959
what do we do

362
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,880
well we could do this we could just walk

363
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,839
away right that's usually not an option

364
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,680
i don't know about you but i don't

365
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,440
really want to just walk away and lose

366
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,680
my job

367
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,639
we could panic and freak out

368
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,519
that's also not an ideal situation right

369
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,880
we want to

370
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,920
take a step back and think about this i

371
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,000
have a whole other talk

372
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,240
one of my hobbies is

373
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,519
i've been a firefighter since 1997 and i

374
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,639
have another talk that talks all about

375
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:03,600
the

376
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,959
similarities and differences of

377
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,959
firefighting and information

378
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,440
security incident response

379
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,519
i would say this is not the time to

380
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,279
panic and freak out and i talk a lot

381
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,440
more about that in that particular talk

382
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,800
so instead we're going to have to

383
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,480
communicate something

384
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,199
something bad has happened again even if

385
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:24,320
your role

386
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,800
is you're you're it and now you have to

387
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,120
communicate to multiple levels within

388
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,040
your org or

389
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,680
maybe your role is smaller and you're

390
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,839
part of a larger group and there's

391
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,360
multiple groups

392
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,000
you still may have to communicate to

393
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,880
multiple levels within your organization

394
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,680
so let's talk about what it's like to

395
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,000
have those communications

396
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,959
what kinds of things to focus on and

397
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,240
ultimately

398
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,120
um

399
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,639
how we're going to get that message

400
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,560
across

401
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,560
so these are the audiences

402
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,040
we're going to focus on the end user

403
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,920
mid-level management and our executives

404
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,240
and the goal is going to be what we call

405
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,560
framing the conversation

406
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,600
which is a really simple concept

407
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,000
framing the conversation is just about

408
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,800
what is important to them that's how

409
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,000
we're going to preface that conversation

410
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,160
so that they're not sitting there

411
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,600
wondering when are they going to get to

412
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,360
something i care about you're going to

413
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,639
jump right into that right away in a way

414
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,279
that they understand

415
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,079
so

416
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,079
in thinking about that you want to

417
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:39,279
anticipate you know what questions might

418
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,839
any one of these folks folks at any of

419
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,360
these levels ask you

420
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,240
you also need to consider how and where

421
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,560
you're going to communicate

422
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,040
that's called a communication channel

423
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,000
so does it make sense with certain in

424
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,800
individuals or groups to communicate on

425
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,480
an internal website

426
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,320
i mean depending on how bad the

427
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,399
situation is that might not be

428
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:05,839
appropriate

429
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,920
do you have to do some sort of a

430
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,079
one-on-one presentation with somebody in

431
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,560
upper management it really is going to

432
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,440
depend greatly on the situation

433
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,000
is email appropriate

434
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,320
maybe part of what is happening with

435
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,959
this particular ransomware is the email

436
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,720
system is impacted

437
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,440
so

438
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,399
maybe that's not the best meet

439
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,160
maybe you have to get everybody in a

440
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,560
room and have in-person conversations

441
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,600
again you have to consider that channel

442
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,079
and because i never want to leave this

443
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:38,959
out

444
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,199
you can always try lawyer approved

445
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,359
carrier pigeons if nothing else

446
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,079
so let's talk next about the end user

447
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,639
so what does the end user focus on

448
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,120
they normally want to figure out how

449
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,199
this is going to impact their work

450
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,560
completion

451
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,639
what is it they do

452
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,720
and how are they getting it done

453
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,319
well this incident impact their

454
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,520
day-to-day

455
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,280
activities

456
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,760
your goal with these folks is to

457
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,359
communicate to them

458
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,919
what happened and why when you can now

459
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,160
that doesn't mean you tell them all the

460
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,559
little technical details

461
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,480
trying to explain solar winds to an end

462
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,160
user for example

463
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,359
uh no

464
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,760
you're probably not gonna do that

465
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,480
but

466
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,480
from the context remember we're talking

467
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,000
about framing that conversation for them

468
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,400
so within that context what happened and

469
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,600
why

470
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,600
for them

471
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,600
you want to use this as an opportunity

472
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,000
for awareness training where you can if

473
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,640
what kicked off this incident is you

474
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,360
know a phishing message or

475
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,039
some form of

476
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,799
um

477
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,240
uh whether it's a phone call or somebody

478
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,600
coming in

479
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,280
and you know they're doing social

480
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,840
engineering in some

481
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,400
capacity that's okay use this as a as an

482
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,720
opportunity to teach right you're not

483
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,480
going to call out

484
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,400
the person or people that were

485
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,559
specifically involved here you're just

486
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,679
going to say

487
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,840
this is what happened this is why it

488
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,440
happened and give them those basics

489
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,160
you want to give them this information

490
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,240
in a way that will be helpful for them

491
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,400
both at work and at home

492
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,080
one of the things i do

493
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,600
within my job at the university of

494
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,880
buffalo is i teach awareness stuff

495
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,520
and when i do that i make a point of

496
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,039
what i am teaching

497
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,400
to not be just solely focused on work i

498
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,880
certainly talk about our different data

499
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,120
classifications and how

500
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,480
they need to

501
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,360
uh

502
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,600
you know avoid sending certain kinds of

503
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,840
data in email for example

504
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,880
however

505
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,640
that's really no different from what

506
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,559
they should be doing at home and the

507
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,200
reality is if you can encourage the

508
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,760
right kind of behavior it doesn't matter

509
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,080
where it is if they start doing the

510
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,880
right thing on their own personal data

511
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,200
because they care about that data

512
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,760
chances are with a little muscle memory

513
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,120
they're going to do the same thing in

514
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,320
the office

515
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,720
so show it as a benefit to them hey if

516
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,440
you

517
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,039
you know if you understand this and you

518
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,760
do it the right way this can protect you

519
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,520
and the people you care about and your

520
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,000
own information not just that of your

521
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,640
organization

522
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,720
you want to be effective and efficient

523
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,559
whenever possible

524
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:31,280
so

525
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,600
and in continuous as well you don't want

526
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,520
to send one message and then stop

527
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,600
because then people get antsy and they

528
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,919
don't know what's going on so continuous

529
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,400
messaging is very important

530
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,240
so what do we mean by

531
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,880
well be concise right less is more again

532
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,880
like i was saying a moment ago

533
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,280
we want to tell them what happened and

534
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,440
why but they don't need all the

535
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,000
technical details they need to know

536
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,240
what's relevant to them

537
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,320
again be judicious

538
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,919
we don't want to blame folks whether

539
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,679
it's management or other other

540
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:08,960
individuals

541
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,039
we don't want to provide irrelevant

542
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,799
information to them

543
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,400
sometimes this can be awkward because

544
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,720
you will get asked questions and you

545
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,640
know your organization has to kind of

546
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,760
dictate

547
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,600
what you're allowed to say but be

548
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,919
thinking about this before it happens

549
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,559
not in the middle of it happening

550
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,679
and we've talked about patients right be

551
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,120
patient

552
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,080
even if you have to explain it for the

553
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,960
300th time and you have to go in a

554
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,840
closet and scream and tear your hair out

555
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,039
and you know beat the walls or whatever

556
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:47,120
it's really important to be patient

557
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,799
at the end of the day

558
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,679
you want to provide communication

559
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,080
at a level that these folks can both

560
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,880
understand and relate to

561
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,480
on their level

562
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,720
and that can be a real challenge as i

563
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,880
mentioned before for those of us in the

564
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,120
tech field because that's not what we're

565
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,280
used to thinking about and it's very

566
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,720
easy to assume that other folks know

567
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,600
what we know and guess what

568
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,720
they don't

569
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,280
and in some cases it's amazing

570
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,559
what other folks know about other

571
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,960
subjects that we don't right so keep

572
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,280
that in mind

573
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,200
this is how we're not

574
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,200
going to communicate with those folks

575
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,720
right we're not going to scream at them

576
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,480
we're not going to talk down to them

577
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,000
we're not going to try to freak them out

578
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,320
or frighten them that doesn't

579
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,918
help our cause in any way

580
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,360
so be upfront and honest this whole idea

581
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,440
of lies to children that will come back

582
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,600
to bite you so don't lie about what's

583
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,000
happening you may have to omit certain

584
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,799
things that's not uncommon

585
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,120
you want to make sure right off the bat

586
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,360
you are addressing any kind of fear

587
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,200
uncertainty and doubt

588
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,360
because this population in particular is

589
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,840
going to be very susceptible to how does

590
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,400
this impact my job what does this mean

591
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,320
you know could i could i lose my job

592
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,880
will i well the projects i'm working on

593
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,880
will something happen to them

594
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,960
as much as you can you want to address

595
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,600
that and that may require a conversation

596
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,320
with

597
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,600
other people

598
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,400
to be able to do that right

599
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,600
remember

600
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,559
that perception is reality for your

601
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,440
average end user what they think they

602
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,960
see whether or not it's true

603
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,600
is their reality

604
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,080
and what that means is if somebody

605
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,159
reaches out to you and says something

606
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,400
weird is happening on my system

607
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,240
and you know from what they're telling

608
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,320
you it's probably nothing

609
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,400
you know they they probably just uh hit

610
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,799
the wrong keys right they hit a funny

611
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:54,159
key combination and it caused a window

612
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,400
to pop up or it changed a venue a a menu

613
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,799
view or something along those lines you

614
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,760
may recognize that as no big deal

615
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,280
but you never know

616
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,120
what you might miss

617
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,200
so take the time and investigate even if

618
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,880
you know it's not a problem

619
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,440
remember what i said earlier about trust

620
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,600
and how important trust is

621
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,640
and any kind of security awareness

622
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,520
is based on trust it's really really

623
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,840
important folks need to feel like they

624
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,000
can reach out to you and say

625
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,240
houston i think we have a problem and

626
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,559
the sooner somebody tells you that the

627
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,799
better off that your organization will

628
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,960
be

629
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,960
all right so moving on to middle

630
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,640
management right

631
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,720
calm down it's all good we're fine

632
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,880
so middle management is typically

633
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,400
focused on whatever their business

634
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,840
processes

635
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,679
so are they out of some operational

636
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:55,120
entity do they run hr is this i.t

637
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,720
it's going to impact their department

638
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,400
and that's going to be their focus right

639
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,400
they're not going to look at necessarily

640
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,919
their day-to-day

641
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:02,720
uh

642
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,400
specific tasks they're going to be

643
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,679
thinking about

644
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,080
what their overall business process

645
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,400
involves and how this is going to impact

646
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,760
that

647
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,520
again you want to speak to them at a

648
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,679
level they can understand and relate to

649
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,840
so what does that mean well again we've

650
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,440
already talked about that very

651
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,799
specifically

652
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,960
but it probably means you're going to

653
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,679
avoid things like geek speak which we'll

654
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,279
come back to

655
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,919
so no technical conversation with

656
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,880
management unless you happen to know

657
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,840
they are

658
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,400
tech savvy and that means they

659
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,919
understand the kind of thing you're

660
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,120
talking about

661
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,919
so there are folks who are in

662
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,880
development um who do programming and

663
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,440
they may be amazing coders and they may

664
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,440
not understand anything about

665
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,080
operational security directly

666
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,919
maybe they do maybe they came out of

667
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,919
some kind of role where you know they

668
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,200
spent time

669
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,600
researching security things the point is

670
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,600
don't take it for granted don't assume

671
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,760
this is how we're not going to

672
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,679
communicate with middle management right

673
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,200
we're not going to do the chicken with

674
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,799
the head cut off

675
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,000
because

676
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,080
that's not helpful we're not gonna run

677
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,000
around and scream oh my god the sky is

678
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,760
falling because that'll just cause them

679
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,600
to say this guy is falling and that

680
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,120
doesn't help anybody

681
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,640
so with ideal middle managers

682
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,159
the ideal middle manager is phenomenal

683
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,400
at delegating they have amazing

684
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,240
interpersonal skills

685
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,840
they're very effective with

686
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,320
communication they can negotiate like

687
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,799
the best of them they have outstanding

688
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,679
emotional intelligence intelligence and

689
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:44,880
they are

690
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,520
fantastic influencers now i don't know

691
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,000
about you

692
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,520
but i'd say this is a pr

693
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,919
space now i can tell you right now the

694
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,919
manager i have is spectacular

695
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,440
and he's probably as close to this as

696
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,679
i've seen in a very long time but the

697
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,880
reality is it's not very common

698
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,799
so we're going to talk about engaging

699
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,720
with your regular middle manager right

700
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,799
not not not the perfect one who's really

701
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,400
good at all of the things but maybe who

702
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,039
is good at some of those things because

703
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,120
ideally that's why they're in middle

704
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,880
management though we all know that

705
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,440
that's not always the case

706
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,600
you want to be supportive of these

707
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,520
mid-level managers

708
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,600
you want to work with them to come up

709
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,919
with some kind of action plan if you're

710
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,679
talking about i.t this could be an

711
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,159
action plan to deal with exactly what's

712
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,559
happening whatever this incident is

713
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,960
it could be giving them the information

714
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,799
they need to make an action plan for

715
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,720
their own unit

716
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,400
but it's got to include communication

717
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,240
that goes up and down the chain

718
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,000
don't leave those users in the dark

719
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,480
remember how important we talked about

720
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,039
that communication being continuous

721
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,440
that's where this kind of comes together

722
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,240
right

723
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,039
so

724
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,880
both telling the folks above these

725
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,880
mid-level managers what's going on and

726
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,159
the folks below them is critical

727
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:05,200
and

728
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,919
more critical is empathy middle

729
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:12,159
management is a really really hard job

730
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:13,600
the folks who are above middle

731
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,440
management they want to stay there and

732
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,200
they want to push mid management down

733
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,440
that's at least typically the the

734
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,279
thought process of course not every

735
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,120
manager is like that but

736
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,960
you know your your typical folks in

737
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,799
executive positions don't necessarily

738
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,480
want to be kicked out by somebody

739
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,679
beneath them

740
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,120
and the folks who are below mid

741
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,279
management are in many cases trying to

742
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,120
get into middle management

743
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,520
so they are often caught between a rock

744
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,600
and a hard place and it can be a really

745
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,039
big challenge

746
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,360
so empathy is important you want to make

747
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,840
whatever you discuss with them whatever

748
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,919
plan you come up with it should make

749
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:50,320
them look good because guess what

750
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,320
that will ultimately make you look good

751
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,720
so what is that plan going to include

752
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,000
well

753
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,760
at a minimum it's going to be a

754
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,679
description of the incident again in

755
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,200
that context of what they care about

756
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,440
ultimately you want to

757
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,960
think about all the stakeholders that

758
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,360
are involved are there internal and

759
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,200
external stakeholders you could very

760
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,440
well have a situation where

761
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,360
you're calling in law enforcement so how

762
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,760
is that going to play a role do you are

763
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,200
there um

764
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,960
you know other board members you have to

765
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,919
think about uh are there other entities

766
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,200
that are

767
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,039
tangential to your organization this

768
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,399
could impact

769
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,320
so you need to be thinking about all of

770
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,080
those stakeholders and if you're in a

771
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,240
main security role or you're all by

772
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,080
yourself this becomes even more critical

773
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,600
and it's tough to think about in the

774
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,880
moment right

775
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,279
so if you can be thinking

776
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,520
in an incident who you need to gather

777
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,559
together so that that communication plan

778
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,399
includes those folks and you think about

779
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,559
this in advance that will only help your

780
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:53,760
cause

781
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,360
now with regard to this specific

782
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,480
incident

783
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,720
consider the recovery options and time

784
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,840
frames and that doesn't mean

785
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,840
the best possible option

786
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,399
or the worst possible option it's all of

787
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,399
the options

788
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:11,200
and how can we keep this from recurring

789
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,480
was this

790
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,080
you know was this a single action

791
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,559
that showed some sort of

792
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,559
gap in a process

793
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,600
was this something where there was a gap

794
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,159
in technology you know what's the

795
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,480
likelihood of this happening again so

796
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,640
you want to reduce that and you want to

797
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,279
talk about how that's going to be done

798
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,760
and the end goal what is the end goal is

799
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,039
the end goal

800
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,799
to get to a certain point in the

801
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,120
incident with these folks or is the end

802
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,000
goal

803
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,919
getting all the way through the incident

804
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,159
this is going to differ depending on

805
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,840
what's happening in your organization in

806
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,880
general

807
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,840
if it's the case of ransomware and it's

808
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,480
say a department-specific ransomware

809
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,360
where

810
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,360
maybe you have you know

811
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,720
20 or 30 people impacted a department

812
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,880
share but it hasn't become entity wide

813
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,279
so the end goal may be to get those

814
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,240
systems off the network cleaned up

815
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,440
in the sense that you know they're

816
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,039
completely rebuilt from scratch you

817
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,440
recover data from backups and and you're

818
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,720
good to go

819
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,799
maybe it's a global

820
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,480
outage and the end goal is to get just

821
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,480
some basics up and running again it's

822
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,000
going to vary but you're going to need

823
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,080
to work with these mid-level managers to

824
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,799
discuss that

825
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,480
managers do need to be accountable for

826
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,279
user and that does not mean we point

827
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:40,480
fingers it means they need to be aware

828
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,480
of the strengths and weaknesses of those

829
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,480
folks right and if you have folks that

830
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,559
are challenging and i think we all know

831
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,480
at least one person who falls in that

832
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,000
role

833
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,480
you need to figure out how they're going

834
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,559
to manage them

835
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:57,679
and the mid manager may look to you for

836
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,600
assistance with us but management needs

837
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,039
to take that responsibility

838
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,760
so these are some questions that you

839
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,440
want to be thinking about and asking

840
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,320
right

841
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,880
how are potential ransom payments going

842
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,159
to be handled

843
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,000
don't ask this question when it's on the

844
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,559
table i mean ultimately of course you

845
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,120
will but but think about this in advance

846
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,120
what are the situations in which you

847
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,039
absolutely wouldn't have a choice and

848
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,480
maybe you'll see a situation you've

849
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,240
never even thought of but but think

850
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,159
about that is there a case where that

851
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:29,120
would be

852
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,120
a thing and if so

853
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,960
how are you going to handle that

854
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,480
are you are you working with an

855
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,919
insurance company where they bring in

856
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,240
another organization that handles that

857
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,080
is is the answer just straight up nope

858
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,480
we're never paying a ransom and now

859
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,559
of course there are legal liabilities if

860
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,600
you pay a ransom or at least there is

861
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,760
legislation that suggests as much right

862
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,760
so some other things you want to ask you

863
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,600
know is this something where we can

864
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,679
collaborate with another unit

865
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:00,399
so is mid management going to manage all

866
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,640
of whatever they're working on or are

867
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,279
they going to delegate some of this out

868
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,720
are they going to delegate or they may

869
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,480
be going to negotiate with another

870
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,480
entity whether it's internal or external

871
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,720
to help and these are all decisions that

872
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,240
mid-level managers are going to need to

873
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,399
think about and make decisions about

874
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:19,279
during an incident

875
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,240
all right top of the tree here let's

876
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,840
talk about those executives

877
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,480
executives require a little more finesse

878
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,320
because they're looking at that big

879
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,679
picture

880
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:37,039
the overall company's goals reputation

881
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,880
performance their vision

882
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,039
and they have very little time

883
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,279
now obviously in certain situations they

884
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,360
may make more time for you

885
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,559
than usual

886
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:47,600
however

887
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,399
you still want to think you've got 30

888
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,559
seconds in an elevator

889
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,399
so let's imagine

890
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,000
you're going to hang out with fido here

891
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,559
in the elevator and you know the exact

892
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,039
some executive in your organization

893
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,559
how are you going to tell them what they

894
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:05,440
need to know in approximately 30 seconds

895
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,279
now that's not to say that at the end of

896
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,600
that they might not ask you for more but

897
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,879
imagine that's all you have

898
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,200
so you need to do your homework you need

899
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,120
to understand as much as you can about

900
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,799
these individuals

901
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,399
you don't want to wait until you're in

902
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:21,600
the middle of this

903
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,080
understand how your executives like

904
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,519
communication

905
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,679
because you might have communication

906
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:29,760
options depending on

907
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,360
what is going on

908
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,960
for the channel right maybe this

909
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,519
individual really really really hates

910
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,360
one-on-ones or really really likes

911
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,600
one-on-ones so remember when we were

912
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,159
talking about the communication channel

913
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,080
well you're going to consider both the

914
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,480
situation itself and the people you're

915
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,559
talking to in terms of what might the

916
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,559
best option be

917
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,880
you want to enter and exit gracefully

918
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,960
regardless of what they say to you the

919
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,120
tone of voice they use

920
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,120
be professional it can be very

921
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,640
frustrating if you're not taken

922
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,360
seriously or if somebody's panicking you

923
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,519
don't want to respond in kind

924
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,600
so think about that

925
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,440
you're going to present and discuss

926
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,520
strategically if they ask you to talk

927
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,199
further

928
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:16,159
write about that particular

929
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,599
information

930
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,760
that you started with the 30 seconds

931
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,399
right so if they do want to talk further

932
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:24,399
and whatever you say it needs to to

933
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,879
involve some sort of strategy and at the

934
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,480
end of the day

935
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,239
remember these people they're just

936
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,719
people too many of them have families

937
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:35,679
and home lives and it can be really easy

938
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,440
to lose sight of that because they're

939
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,839
the big boss so and so

940
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:40,560
but

941
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,280
they are people

942
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,079
this is the kind of thing your executive

943
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,560
will probably want to know

944
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,159
they're going to want a non-technical

945
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,159
description of what happened and when

946
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,199
non-technical even at the say cio level

947
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,839
they may want non-technical because

948
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,839
their strength may be in business not so

949
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:03,520
much the actual technology itself

950
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,280
remember when we talked about the

951
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,240
possible options at mid-level management

952
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,440
well

953
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,640
this is where you're going to

954
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,839
potentially

955
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:13,520
provide this additional information

956
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,920
maybe you're in that at that level

957
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,280
you're going to give them the best case

958
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,400
in the worst case and what's most likely

959
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,040
and ideally the consequences of what

960
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,839
happened and underlying causes if you

961
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:27,359
know them and again you're going to

962
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,720
leave out technical jargon um we're not

963
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,200
going to dive too deeply into this

964
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,720
you're going to do it from that big

965
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,720
picture

966
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,720
so when speaking to executives we're

967
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,040
going to avoid the techno babble we're

968
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,680
going to avoid the geek speak the lingo

969
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,920
our buzzwords right all of this kind of

970
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,680
stuff gets in the way of us

971
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,800
communicating that message

972
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,400
so which executive should you get that

973
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,760
message to

974
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,000
well you want to make sure that

975
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,560
ultimately if it's a large

976
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,040
company-wide incident you want to get it

977
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,720
to all of these groups

978
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,599
because finance may be impacted

979
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,680
what we saw recently with the pipeline

980
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,240
right the issue there the initial issue

981
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,079
there was quite frankly their billing

982
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:13,760
system went down well that's that's

983
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,720
finance right but operations is impacted

984
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,560
because it's it's going to impact

985
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,400
whether it's some portion of the org or

986
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,720
a larger portion of the org probably is

987
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,920
going to impact

988
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,720
their

989
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,040
operation from some perspective

990
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,359
you may need to let hr know this is

991
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:30,960
going to depend on the size of the

992
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,440
incident and how many folks are involved

993
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,520
you certainly want your heads of

994
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,520
marketing or communications or pr

995
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,440
whatever you have and maybe you have all

996
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,560
three

997
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,560
and this will depend again on their

998
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,480
function in your organization

999
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,400
but those executives should understand

1000
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,400
that there's something happening

1001
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,800
legal certainly and in fact i would

1002
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,119
probably bump legal up the food chain to

1003
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,359
one of the highest parts because

1004
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:56,960
especially if you're going to be dealing

1005
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,400
with any kind of legal ramifications

1006
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,560
from something like ransomware you're

1007
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,839
going to need legal and you're going to

1008
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:05,440
need them to understand what's going on

1009
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,000
so they can advise you properly and of

1010
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,800
course if you haven't already told it

1011
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,480
they should know too right

1012
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,200
so the question is we've gone to each of

1013
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,320
these groups

1014
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,920
we've discussed

1015
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,079
or maybe you know you went to one group

1016
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,400
and a co-worker of yours went to another

1017
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,720
and you've told them all of these things

1018
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,960
you've given them the right information

1019
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,760
you've tried to relay the best you can

1020
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,599
what you understand about this you've

1021
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,079
tried to frame it in the best possible

1022
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:38,640
way for them to understand it

1023
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,240
the question is

1024
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,400
just because you said it

1025
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,240
doesn't mean that they understood it

1026
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,200
so

1027
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,040
whether or not

1028
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,040
they got the message

1029
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,760
you may not know

1030
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,359
one of the ways

1031
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,119
we can know whether a message is

1032
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,760
received is non-verbal communications

1033
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,520
now obviously we talked about these

1034
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,280
different channels right these different

1035
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,119
communication channels

1036
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,880
you're not going to have a sense of

1037
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,280
nonverbal communication if it's just an

1038
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,240
email

1039
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,400
you're not going to have this if it's in

1040
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,280
some other messaging you know teams app

1041
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,960
perhaps where it's just some sort of

1042
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,640
text it can be very difficult to read

1043
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,480
any kind of non-verbals and we can

1044
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,720
misread that very easily

1045
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,599
but if there's any kind of one-on-one

1046
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:30,320
whether it's in person or over zoom for

1047
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,520
example

1048
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,160
or some other mechanism

1049
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,160
there's usually some non-verbals and

1050
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,440
that's what we're going to talk about

1051
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,680
next

1052
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,599
we want to pay very

1053
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:45,359
close attention to body language right i

1054
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,119
mean look at these faces

1055
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,280
you know what's going on with these kids

1056
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,760
right you know who's really angry who's

1057
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,440
who's quizzical

1058
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,760
who's surprised

1059
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,440
we can see that in their body language

1060
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,359
so it includes all of these kinds of

1061
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,280
things whether it's facial expressions

1062
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,640
or posture the kind of gestures we make

1063
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,000
it can come across in something as

1064
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,320
simple as a handshake or how someone is

1065
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,720
breathing so that's the kind of thing

1066
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,839
that we're talking about

1067
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,640
so how do we interpret these nonverbal

1068
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,240
cues that we see because people give

1069
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,400
nonverbal cues all the time

1070
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,640
so what happens if somebody has raised

1071
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,920
eyebrows right how do we interpret that

1072
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,079
well the problem is there's multiple

1073
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:32,000
ways that many of these things can be

1074
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,680
interpreted

1075
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,560
raised eyebrows can be you know surprise

1076
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,320
they can be doubt

1077
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,720
they could be some form of discomfort

1078
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,440
if i'm staring right into your eyes

1079
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,280
and i don't blink and there's excessive

1080
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,720
eye contact

1081
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,359
is it because i'm like super interested

1082
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,040
in what you're saying

1083
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,880
or is it because

1084
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,839
i'm really trying very hard not to let

1085
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:58,160
you know that i'm lying to you

1086
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,079
because if i stare right at you maybe

1087
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,160
maybe you'll think you know i'm i'm

1088
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,079
giving it my all and it doesn't matter

1089
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:04,800
and

1090
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,680
um

1091
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,480
you know that that can be misleading

1092
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,480
what about crossed arms and legs

1093
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,480
i think we've all gone into meetings

1094
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,720
where people cross their arms and legs

1095
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,839
so

1096
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:17,920
does that mean they necessarily are

1097
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,960
close to an idea which is a cue we can

1098
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,400
get from that

1099
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,280
or

1100
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,680
did someone turn the heat off in a room

1101
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,240
and it's cold or you know just maybe

1102
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,640
somebody's not feeling well maybe their

1103
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,720
mind's a million miles away

1104
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,960
same thing with exaggerated knotting if

1105
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,319
i'm doing this

1106
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:39,599
all the time am i just really nervous

1107
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,280
about whether or not you're accepting my

1108
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,319
idea

1109
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:44,560
or am i super excited about what you're

1110
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,760
saying

1111
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,520
the point is that any one of these cues

1112
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,760
can be misleading

1113
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,440
so we need to think about what we call

1114
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,839
the nonverbal cues

1115
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:00,000
and that's this idea where we read the

1116
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,760
person and the situation and we sort of

1117
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,920
blend it together right so if we have a

1118
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,440
situation where somebody has their

1119
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,599
eyebrows raised their eyes are looking

1120
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,760
all over the place and they're maybe

1121
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,720
gripping something really hard

1122
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,400
odds are

1123
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,040
if all of those things come together

1124
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,040
there's a sense of discomfort

1125
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,880
so we need to take each one of those

1126
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,119
cues and pull them together as opposed

1127
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,640
to just looking at them individually

1128
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:30,160
all right so i'm going to wrap up here

1129
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,839
one of the things i want to make sure to

1130
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:34,960
get across is that our job i believe

1131
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,000
very strongly that our job in security

1132
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,440
is to educate

1133
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,599
that's my number one job all the

1134
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:44,160
technology stuff i do throughout my day

1135
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,079
and i do a whole bunch i wear tons of

1136
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,000
hats in our office because we have very

1137
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,200
few people i do incident response i do

1138
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,000
forensics i do awareness i do all kinds

1139
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,200
of things

1140
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,800
but regardless of which of those

1141
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,319
technical things i'm doing or

1142
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:00,319
non-technical things i'm doing

1143
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,640
i believe my job is to educate

1144
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,720
if i'm writing a forensics report it's

1145
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,040
to educate through my words if i'm

1146
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,240
giving us a talk i'm trying to educate

1147
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,119
through

1148
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:13,200
the uh the verbal word as opposed to the

1149
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,319
written word

1150
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:16,480
we are not there to adjudicate

1151
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,720
incidents are hard

1152
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,359
nobody i think really enjoys walking

1153
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:22,880
into an incident

1154
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,119
and having to be you know kind of in the

1155
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,200
middle of that and the stress of the

1156
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,640
incident i mean certainly those of us

1157
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,480
who are incident responders

1158
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,599
um

1159
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,200
you know there is a certain excitement

1160
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,560
and and i can't deny that there are

1161
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,079
people who really enjoy that rush and

1162
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:37,440
that's awesome

1163
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,839
but everybody else is probably really

1164
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:42,880
uncomfortable and so remember that we

1165
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,079
don't want to be the folks who are

1166
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:46,000
making judgment

1167
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,160
we want to learn what other people know

1168
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,240
one of the jobs that i had early on when

1169
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,640
i was doing support i worked for an

1170
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,680
entity

1171
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,480
that

1172
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,960
was a government contractor

1173
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,680
and you know the the jokes people like

1174
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,359
to make about

1175
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:03,359
it's not rocket science

1176
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:04,560
guess what

1177
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,560
these folks are rocket scientists and

1178
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,599
they were super duper smart

1179
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,119
guess what i don't know a whole lot

1180
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:14,000
about rocket science guess what they

1181
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
didn't know a whole lot about

1182
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,440
computing day-to-day desktop computing

1183
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,040
boy did they know their rocket science

1184
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,400
in that level

1185
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,440
but you know using microsoft word that

1186
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,000
was a little more challenging

1187
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:28,800
so

1188
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,160
i taught them

1189
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,119
about

1190
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:33,040
how to do what they needed to and the

1191
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,119
tools that they were given for that

1192
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:36,240
purpose

1193
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,400
and they taught me some cool things you

1194
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,400
know about rocket science now i'll be

1195
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,920
honest i don't remember a whole lot

1196
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,280
about it right now

1197
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,599
um but the reality is we need to share

1198
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,400
our knowledge as i mentioned before

1199
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,640
we really don't know what they don't

1200
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,480
know and they don't know what we don't

1201
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,119
know and so communicating and sharing

1202
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:57,440
communication is absolutely a two-way

1203
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,319
goal

1204
00:43:58,319 --> 00:43:59,680
you want to share

1205
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,000
information you want that person to give

1206
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,079
you some feedback so that you know in

1207
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:06,240
some capacity that they understood you

1208
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,200
and vice versa

1209
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,000
i'm a big proponent of be that change

1210
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,800
you see folks out there who you know

1211
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,160
treat folks not well

1212
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,079
don't be that person

1213
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:21,920
and i'm gonna i'm gonna skip the

1214
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,200
question slide because we're gonna we're

1215
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,760
gonna go do that online uh but i wanna

1216
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,000
end with this thought

1217
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,040
um this douglas adams quote because as i

1218
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,680
mentioned i started my journey in

1219
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,960
security really with end user and server

1220
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,760
support that's where i started and i had

1221
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,400
no idea i was even going to go there

1222
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,280
i have an in my initial degree is

1223
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,599
actually in music industry i have

1224
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:49,280
several other degrees that have nothing

1225
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,280
directly to do with security

1226
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,280
but i think ultimately regardless of

1227
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,680
that i ended up where i needed to be

1228
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,599
which is why i love this quote

1229
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:59,680
and with that i will thank you very much

1230
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:03,640
for coming to hear me today
