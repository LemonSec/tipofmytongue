thank you so much for joining this talk

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,880
this talk is on

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,439
the business resiliency case how to make

7
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,439
that business case i'm gonna give you a

8
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,920
couple case studies and how that works

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,079
and uh and then we'll go from there i am

10
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,280
going to attempt to attempt

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,200
to also be monitoring the chat channel

12
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,719
so if you guys have any questions on

13
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,120
around resiliency let me know if you

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,879
have any questions around potatoes or

15
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,480
bread check the channel i've already

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,760
answered those and we will uh i will be

17
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,920
taking a break every couple moments on

18
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,039
the section breaks to uh to catch up and

19
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,559
see what's in there

20
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,320
hi my name is wolfgang gorlick if you do

21
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,840
not know me uh i am an advisory cso with

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,080
dual security i focus predominantly

23
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,280
these days

24
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,119
on the front end of identity and access

25
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,760
management sso passwordless

26
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,240
multi-factor strong authentication easy

27
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,000
to use authentication

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,400
before this before this i did a lot of

29
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,960
work in business continuity i've given a

30
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,360
lot of talks on topic i've written a lot

31
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,880
about it i really

32
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,240
feel that it's uh it's an underlooked

33
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,159
avenue for building security programs

34
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,280
and that's what i'm going to hopefully

35
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,960
convince you of today

36
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,479
however when

37
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,880
when the pandemic set in when the

38
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,640
pandemic set in

39
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,720
the beginning of last year when all this

40
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,880
went down

41
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,759
i

42
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:44,799
went

43
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,560
and uh and i went and i talked to folks

44
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,799
who i had helped i talked to folks who i

45
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,320
had worked with uh their business

46
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,640
continuity plans i called our friends

47
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,000
like this would be great this would be a

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,479
great case study and how preparing can

49
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,719
help get you ready for this so i know

50
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,960
that uh we have done

51
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,159
work with uh with the cdc's zombie

52
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,479
preparedness kit i know we've done

53
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,959
uh work with uh table topping with your

54
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,080
executives tell me tell me my friend how

55
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,160
successful were you at shifting to

56
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,879
remote work how successful were you at

57
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,400
handling

58
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,440
what happened when the world shut down

59
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,840
and uh and the answer wasn't good

60
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,239
to to a person everyone's like oh yeah

61
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,560
we did we did do that didn't we

62
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,040
even organizations that we had followed

63
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,760
the cdc zombie preparedness uh plan

64
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,840
which if you are looking for a tabletop

65
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,720
or a good uh good way to mock out a

66
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,640
pandemic i recommend

67
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,760
um even those that we had done this with

68
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,560
said

69
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,560
you know i remember we did the plan but

70
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,319
when it happened we were too busy we

71
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,200
were we went into to response mode we

72
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,879
reacted we put places and things uh

73
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,040
where they needed to go and we did not

74
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,840
necessarily follow those plans we

75
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,159
made which was disappointing

76
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,400
but not necessarily surprising there's

77
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,959
stats out of gartner from 2020 that

78
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,800
showed that less than 14 percent or

79
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,319
about 1 in 10

80
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,840
organizations are really able to do good

81
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,560
bcdr

82
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,519
not a good thing to to be looking at

83
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,519
so in today's session i'm going to look

84
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,360
at three different business cases of how

85
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,599
organizations uh firmed up strengthened

86
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,280
their resiliency programs i'm going to

87
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,440
define resiliency in just a moment

88
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,440
and then i'm going to look at where

89
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,319
people go wrong

90
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,080
specifically after assessing nearly 200

91
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,840
organizations

92
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,840
what are some of the common themes that

93
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,239
people keep doing wrong again and again

94
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,239
other than the normal one which is oh

95
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,640
yeah we did have a plan that was cute i

96
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,720
remember that tabletop it was fun you

97
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,920
brought in donuts um other than that

98
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,480
where do people go wrong

99
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,560
so when i'm talking about resiliency for

100
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,239
the sake of today's conversation i'm

101
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,319
talking about technical resiliency

102
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,319
uh i'm not talking about

103
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,319
uh self-resiliency i'm not talking about

104
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,920
supply chain resiliency i'm not talking

105
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,360
about organization i'm talking about

106
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,120
technical resiliency which is a

107
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,600
combination of recovery and continuity

108
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,918
disaster recovery business continuity

109
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,600
a combination of that with instant

110
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,320
response when things go wrong we act and

111
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,120
a combination of that with traditional

112
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,240
uh it problem management so if it's if

113
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,000
it's a natural disaster it's an

114
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,600
adversary who's doing something against

115
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,080
us or if it's simply because our tech

116
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,639
doesn't work right that's not a denial

117
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,560
of service we paid for that if it's one

118
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,400
of those scenarios

119
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,600
it can be tackled and handled with uh

120
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,240
good strong cyber resiliency i hate the

121
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,400
term cyber resiliency but uh there you

122
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,919
go

123
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,080
i'm about to tell you stories

124
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,160
and the stories you are about to hear

125
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,600
are based

126
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,919
on real life events

127
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,440
uh just note that they're not

128
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,120
necessarily representative of any

129
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,919
particular organization environment uh

130
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,680
friend client someone who might be on

131
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,520
the stream someone might be underscored

132
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,280
someone who might know me on twitter if

133
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,280
you think this is about you i promise

134
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,039
it's not that we are not avoiding any

135
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,400
customer confidentiality uh but this is

136
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,120
summations of stories that are very

137
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,600
representative of uh the real world

138
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,039
today

139
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,680
so with that let's look at

140
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,880
the uh the first business case which is

141
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,360
financial services

142
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,560
let me take a quick sip of coffee

143
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,039
all right

144
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,800
in the beginning in the beginning of

145
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,280
this financial services company

146
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,520
um they had some things going on their

147
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,680
their business continuity plan

148
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,479
uh wasn't so much a plan as it was a

149
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:51,759
country culture

150
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,479
it was a nice culture to be to be sure

151
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,800
it was a very pretty tree uh and

152
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,479
everyone knew who to call

153
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,639
except for it was a little bit outdated

154
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,639
maybe a year and some people who are on

155
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,319
the call tree had already left but it

156
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,319
was a very pretty tree and it was very

157
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,680
well formatted

158
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,800
the

159
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,000
continuity program itself was run by an

160
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,319
operations project manager

161
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,639
um who was designated as the bcdr

162
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,680
manager we'll get back to why this

163
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,960
is a common theme the the delegation

164
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,600
problem and why i suspect

165
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,000
a lot of ransomware is actually

166
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,800
exploiting technical debt that accrues

167
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,039
by delegating to the wrong level that's

168
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,039
the story for another time of this talk

169
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,600
uh there were exercises they were

170
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,319
definitely doing security exercises

171
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,880
uh they would be fire drills

172
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,680
they were documented as tests now that

173
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,479
uh doesn't necessarily cover your tech

174
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,680
stack

175
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,560
um

176
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,440
but at least exercise the call tree

177
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,400
and uh and that was the state they're in

178
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,000
so a audit finding comes out as you guys

179
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,240
may know in financial services there's

180
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,919
been a lot

181
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,880
more interest as of late

182
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,280
in uh in business continuing disaster

183
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,599
recovery not only in

184
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,599
the organization that you're in but also

185
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,360
in the supply chain so do you have a

186
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,599
good handle on your

187
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,360
critical applications are they tiered do

188
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,720
you have a recovery strategy that goes

189
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,000
along with those tiers and and

190
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,759
for the apps that are outside of your

191
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,599
purview which is of course a growing

192
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:28,560
number

193
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,400
compared to where we're all at as we

194
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,319
move everything to sas for the apps

195
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,400
outside your purview have you also

196
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,400
ensured that their

197
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,160
business continuity disaster recovery

198
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,319
plan is up to date and meets your

199
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,639
requirements a lot of pressure there so

200
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,280
audit finding happens

201
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,560
and uh and the organization has to go

202
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,720
and address that

203
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,080
now from a business continuity plan the

204
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,479
audit

205
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,199
finding sorry from a business case

206
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,080
perspective the audit finding is

207
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,800
one of our our most powerful and yet

208
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,360
dullest weapons because if you can't

209
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,440
ignore an audit finding you have to

210
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,039
resolve an audit finding right if

211
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,520
internal audit says you're wrong um now

212
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,680
you've got a a voice that goes up to the

213
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,400
board and you've got uh you know the

214
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,639
ability to really push things forward

215
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,720
and get things done

216
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,919
awesome

217
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,960
the downside of that is compliance being

218
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,759
what it is uh organizations are heavily

219
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,919
incentivized to spend the least amount

220
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,599
of time and effort

221
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,440
to address that audit finding why

222
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,200
wouldn't you why would you right oh just

223
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,519
do anything extra there's

224
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,880
there's not necessarily any upside and

225
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,720
anyone who wants to tell me security has

226
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,080
an roi

227
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,200
uh

228
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,560
i will say let's have a great

229
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,320
conversation over some drinks because i

230
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,640
always wonder about that what is the roi

231
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,720
of an audit finding

232
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,000
in this case it wasn't necessarily high

233
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,880
so the strategic contents was trying to

234
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,519
address that audit finding and provide

235
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,080
some basic high level recovery tiering

236
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,600
here's what we're going to do to keep

237
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,120
systems up

238
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,200
from a financial perspective

239
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,080
there were certainly uh you know

240
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,240
penalties associated with not resolving

241
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,880
that as it moved to the external letters

242
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,399
however most of it was based on downtime

243
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,399
uh versus recovery investment so how

244
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,000
much are we going to lose if something

245
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,600
is is down that question

246
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,360
i think is really paramount for an

247
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,760
overall risk manager's program what do

248
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,600
we lose what do we care if this piece of

249
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,240
technology doesn't work ah

250
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,240
you ask someone that ask an application

251
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,600
owner that what does it matter to you

252
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,000
and they'll go uh it's it's important

253
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,720
okay put a dollar figure on that

254
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,440
all the dollars

255
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,680
it can be very difficult in traditional

256
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,600
risk management to really quantify

257
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,760
downtime uh it was easier in this

258
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,040
organization because they could look at

259
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,320
past outages factor in

260
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,800
what happens with penalties with market

261
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,399
moves and that so on and really do a

262
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,000
good model

263
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,560
so we need to nail down the financials

264
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,560
the stakeholders audit already mentioned

265
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,399
how the cfo uh cio and cso both reported

266
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,440
up through the cfo and this organization

267
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,839
so there's a lot of focus on getting it

268
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:22,720
done

269
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,560
and really the the management approach

270
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,519
was how we're going to build this how

271
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,560
we're going to manage the management

272
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,079
approach was

273
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,000
well we'll build a new continuity

274
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,079
recovery program and we'll move that up

275
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,240
out of project management put it under

276
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,079
the cso

277
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,560
and we'll use this as a way to drive

278
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,079
insights into our program

279
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,839
so when they execute it that was the

280
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,360
business case right

281
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,120
fix the auto findings justified based on

282
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,360
uh potential cost avoidance here's our

283
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,279
key stakeholders and what we're going to

284
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,480
do we're going to do some tiering and

285
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,560
we're going to rely on some i.t

286
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,320
infrastructure to do the recovery

287
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,240
when they went ahead and built that one

288
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,000
of the interesting things i liked about

289
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,320
this is they developed a flexible

290
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,720
strategy for multiple scenarios the cfo

291
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,959
was well known as saying oh plan for an

292
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,880
asteroid crashing into the data center

293
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,760
and totalling everything out what do we

294
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,480
do if the asteroid hits

295
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,240
great question

296
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,200
very unlikely also

297
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,040
what's surprising

298
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,920
is

299
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,600
if an asteroid hits and everything goes

300
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,200
out at once

301
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,920
you may actually be in a better spot

302
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,560
right if if the asteroid takes out uh

303
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,079
amazon east you may be in a better spot

304
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,320
than if it's a rolling outage

305
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,760
why because you don't have to worry

306
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,920
about data corruption you don't have to

307
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,519
worry about the integrity you have a

308
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,600
point in time that asteroid hit

309
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,959
and is done

310
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,720
and it's a much easier recovery

311
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,680
surprisingly so than if you've got

312
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,600
multiple outages that you're trying to

313
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,399
tackle or worse if you get adversaries

314
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,160
working through your environment so i'd

315
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,720
almost rather face an asteroid but

316
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,639
it gave in all those

317
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,519
potential impacts asteroids fire flame

318
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,560
pandemic um

319
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,440
you know

320
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,920
disconnected from the network loss of

321
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,839
sight loss application

322
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,639
build out a grid and grouped all those

323
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,519
into

324
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,000
a few simple scenarios that allow them

325
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,399
to go ahead and execute uh recovery

326
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,160
either people or key applications or

327
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,519
systems

328
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,440
prioritize the processes and tiered the

329
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,920
assets again based on money value

330
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,360
incredibly important we'll get back to

331
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,800
that when it comes to risk management

332
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,079
and other things

333
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,639
and then use this process to see so use

334
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,560
this process to have an ongoing

335
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,680
conversation with the organization

336
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,480
i want to dovetail into

337
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,519
uh

338
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,440
a study we recently did at cisco for

339
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,079
just a minute uh it's you can download

340
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,360
if you want i'm going to give you the

341
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,680
highlights as they apply to resiliency

342
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,160
uh but science institute worked with uh

343
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,880
with us talked to 48 000 people and

344
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,560
basically said they have all the things

345
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,320
you're doing and all the outcomes you

346
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,480
have what outcomes are getting and what

347
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,839
are you doing well

348
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,760
then did the math behind the scenes and

349
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,880
surfaced

350
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,760
um

351
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,440
areas where

352
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,880
people were doing these and seeing a

353
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,079
whole bunch of outcomes that they

354
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,480
reported right so the whole question of

355
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,560
does anything i'm doing in security

356
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,160
matter

357
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,560
this is a very hard thing to answer uh

358
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,560
we got a little bit closer on by doing

359
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,160
this exercise

360
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,519
so i'm gonna pull out some of the things

361
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,040
throughout this conversation that we

362
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,480
found we found that resilient

363
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,560
organizations are much more likely to

364
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,959
have the confidence of executive

365
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,279
leadership i think

366
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,240
in terms of implementing that resiliency

367
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,920
program i mentioned in terms of

368
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,320
implementing that program

369
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,000
i think that's because

370
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,920
the conversation from the cso

371
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,399
perspective elevated from i'm talking

372
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,160
about this piece of technology too i'm

373
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,760
talking about what marist organization

374
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,440
i'm talking about trading talking about

375
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,959
account reconciliation talking about

376
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,000
those things and when you frame security

377
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,760
uh in the lens of the business

378
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,000
security gets done good security is

379
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,399
within context of the organization

380
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,320
but that's very hard to do if we don't

381
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,760
know what all this stuff that we have

382
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,199
means so i suspect what's going on here

383
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,360
with the finding that resilient

384
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,000
organizations are better confidence

385
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,440
of the leadership is because they're

386
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,600
speaking their languages

387
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,760
they're also more likely to keep up with

388
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,880
the business

389
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,560
i also suspect that's because if you

390
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,720
understand the business process level

391
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,120
what you need to do for good uh business

392
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,639
impact analysis have you understand at

393
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,680
that level

394
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,120
it's much easier to get in and delve in

395
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,519
and help change processes or change

396
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,519
technologies because you've got that

397
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,160
understanding

398
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,839
there's a light bulb moment in this

399
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,320
particular case

400
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,120
where after we built the business case

401
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,360
built the program we started feeding

402
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,680
that program into different

403
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,920
um security capabilities

404
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,360
so for example we're using that bia to

405
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,399
feed into the scene we're using that bia

406
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,760
to feed into the vulnerability

407
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,519
management program so if i'm talking

408
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,279
about patching a server

409
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,800
to the cfo

410
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,880
i'm not necessarily talking about

411
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,959
we need to patch server we're talking at

412
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,639
the level of we're going to execute a

413
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,040
change to protect the trading system

414
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,399
at the same time if we're doing an

415
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,120
investigation in the scene we're not

416
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,399
necessarily looking at a million

417
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,839
different assets and trying to figure

418
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,000
out what matters we're prioritizing them

419
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,600
based on what they married to the

420
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,240
organization therefore have a much

421
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,880
clearer view into what investigations

422
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,079
and alerts actually matter

423
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,519
and that gets to another finding

424
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,240
when we did the correlation with 4 800

425
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,480
uh you know security professionals is

426
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,160
that organizations are more resilient

427
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,720
are also better at identifying and

428
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,880
managing top risks i suspect it's

429
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,199
because those risks are put in context

430
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,160
if you think about uh seem and you think

431
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,000
about investigating i remember just

432
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,920
chewing up so much time

433
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,079
uh in the early days we're just throwing

434
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,480
the logs at it trying to get out

435
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,480
an insight trying to figure out what i

436
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,440
need to act on when we get the context

437
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,839
of here's all this stuff here's why it

438
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,199
matters here's what we're going to do

439
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,240
about it significantly easier

440
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,720
so that's the first case study right the

441
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,199
outcomes of this were

442
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,800
implementing recovery implementing

443
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,720
continuity and using that to drive

444
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,839
downstream efforts

445
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,079
and pop over to discord real quick don't

446
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:46,800
see any questions so i am moving forward

447
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,240
all right the next next case study is a

448
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,320
sas company so they're building sas

449
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,839
applications

450
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,320
and uh and they're using

451
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,199
uh you know traditional sas services to

452
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,279
meet their customer needs

453
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,679
so continuity plan

454
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,919
what continuity plan

455
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,039
uh there really wasn't one that wasn't

456
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,679
uh wasn't a focus

457
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,559
uh of the of the organization they're

458
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,720
predominantly focused on

459
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,400
growing their apps growing their

460
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,000
customer base growing their annual

461
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,720
revenue right arr

462
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,799
and really heavily focused on

463
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,319
acquisition

464
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,280
they had shifted to a devops model

465
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,400
so devops was their delivery strategy

466
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,240
which meant for you know you probably

467
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,919
have one security person for every 10

468
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,919
ops people for every 100 developers

469
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,760
there's a lot of diffusion of security

470
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,160
knowledge about the fusion of how things

471
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,840
need to be built the cso was very

472
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,880
focused on that problem was very focused

473
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,640
on co-level security so it could tell

474
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,480
you about how we're doing sas scans or

475
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,280
desk scans uh what we're doing for our

476
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,559
waff

477
00:17:58,559 --> 00:17:59,520
however

478
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,559
was not necessarily looking at

479
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,960
the feature level or the availability

480
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,160
level

481
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,160
and then there was an outage

482
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,320
it just so happened that the outage

483
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,520
occurred uh during a very uh visible uh

484
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,520
presentation where they're talking about

485
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,280
the benefits of the program and doing a

486
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,520
demo and everything and it's out they

487
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,720
can't can't get at it

488
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,679
so we've got to build the business case

489
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:28,799
here

490
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,960
for uh for this again i'm going to talk

491
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,960
about the strategic context the

492
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,200
financials our stakeholders

493
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,520
and some of the downstream efforts that

494
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,880
need to happen

495
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,640
so from a strategic context the the real

496
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,760
primary driver is going to be around

497
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,600
uptime right we know uptime is crucial

498
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,440
for sas growth you lose customers if

499
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,720
you're down you lose uh you lose

500
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,559
credibility if you're down you get a lot

501
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,720
of buzz off of twitter which is not good

502
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,280
buzz to have when you're down

503
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,240
so that's really the the overall context

504
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,080
the financials are going to be driven by

505
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,919
that sre function right that's site

506
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,960
reliable the engineering function

507
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,760
what does it cost for us to be down

508
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,760
in terms of delivering services

509
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,640
and and not only direct cost like in the

510
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,240
previous example with the financial

511
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,679
services if we're down for an hour we

512
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,120
lose this much money

513
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,440
but also future leading costs which is

514
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,600
we notice that if we're down for an hour

515
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,760
that delays customer sign ups over the

516
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,080
next three months

517
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,480
so a much more

518
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,080
uh

519
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,200
forward-looking model in terms of

520
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,840
justifying investments in

521
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,559
the uh the recovery continuity

522
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,720
the management approach had

523
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,880
high availability and resiliency under

524
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,000
devops that had governance under the cso

525
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,200
that was the approach they're going to

526
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,520
take originally you know

527
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,080
h.a wasn't really considered well we're

528
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,000
in the cloud it's not good

529
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,240
until it's not

530
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,400
so the management approach that they're

531
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,039
going to take with this business case

532
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,480
is to

533
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,559
double down an sre and aha under devops

534
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,320
and then establish and maintain a

535
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,640
continuity recovery governance model

536
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,360
with the cso

537
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,000
in doing this it's a it's a joint

538
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,520
business case right it's a joint

539
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,880
business case between the head of

540
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,520
product and the head of security uh the

541
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,720
effort is to think about this in terms

542
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,880
of like chaos engineering

543
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,679
or

544
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,080
other you know unplanned outages so not

545
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,640
only from an overall holistic let's keep

546
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,240
the product up but also from an

547
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,720
individual if this function fails let's

548
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,400
keep the product up if that server fails

549
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,679
let's keep the product up let's make

550
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,280
sure we have multiple availability zones

551
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,799
in aws those sort of things

552
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,559
as well as tying that incident pipeline

553
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,159
when we see something down and we need

554
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:01,559
to act on it into a broader context

555
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,400
when they executed on this plan

556
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,039
a couple things came up

557
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,080
first was uh and we see this in the data

558
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,880
with uh the security outcomes first was

559
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,880
by doing this in partnership with had a

560
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,280
product in the head of security we built

561
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,080
really good peer support the devops team

562
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,159
knew that they needed to to keep things

563
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,320
up and they knew why and they felt that

564
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,840
the security team was supporting them

565
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,600
and giving them good guidance not

566
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,440
necessarily just waiting to point out oh

567
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,600
you got to fly on your code fix that

568
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,000
much better peer support likewise the

569
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,559
security team knew that the product

570
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,720
people cared about availability and knew

571
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,559
that by caring about availability we can

572
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,080
back into

573
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,760
other security incidents and other

574
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,720
perspectives so they're able to create

575
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,240
much better peer-to-peer support

576
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,600
and i think

577
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,159
when we look at business

578
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,679
cases that are

579
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,880
predicated on compliance

580
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,360
as was the first example

581
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,400
very difficult to get well-funded

582
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,480
and the emphasis is always on do as

583
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,159
little as possible as quick as possible

584
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,559
to get this done as fast as possible

585
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,159
when we look at

586
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,880
business cases that satisfy business

587
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,720
need first and here this was exactly it

588
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,360
right keep us up keep our product going

589
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,679
we look at business cases that satisfy

590
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,520
business need first

591
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,400
and and by satisfying the business need

592
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,440
provide security as a secondary outcome

593
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,960
those business cases tend to see

594
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,039
significantly higher funding

595
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,760
greater peer support and having a longer

596
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,440
tail so that once you've got it up and

597
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,880
running you don't forget that you got a

598
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,159
plan and everything else

599
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,120
another thing that's interesting about

600
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,760
this was um

601
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,120
diffusing resiliency into

602
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,440
the individual container level or micro

603
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,120
service level meant that there was much

604
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,520
lower unplanned work right

605
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,679
much less wasted effort why because when

606
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,919
something happened the system could self

607
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,600
heal if they notice that the way they

608
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,240
set this up is if they notice that

609
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,840
um

610
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,760
they're getting garbage on one of their

611
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,520
apis for example you know someone

612
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,159
sending in um us dollars and it was

613
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,559
supposed to be yen or sending in a

614
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:27,840
string when it was supposed to be a

615
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,600
number or attempting a sql injection

616
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,159
flaw which never happens

617
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,039
usually uh when that happened that was

618
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,600
seen as a a

619
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,640
potential outage and the host that was

620
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,200
sending that information was identified

621
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,279
wiped and reloaded using an ansible

622
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,520
playbook so it made the environment the

623
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,600
entire environment much more resilient

624
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,840
when anything went wrong we reset to

625
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,279
normal and then went from there

626
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,440
now interesting light bulb moment for me

627
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,039
on this one was

628
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,559
the fact that

629
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,799
um

630
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,640
in a way

631
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,279
high availability leads to high security

632
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,360
you know there's uh so no use dye

633
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,720
concepts right if you haven't looked at

634
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,039
diets well worth looking at distributed

635
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,760
immutable ephemeral if we can erase and

636
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,799
rebuild an environment faster than an

637
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,640
adversary can break in and stage tools

638
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,159
then we win

639
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,320
because they can't get a foothold and

640
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,880
that was exactly what this organization

641
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,520
found they had a situation where

642
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,240
uh they're running kubernetes

643
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,240
and uh kubernetes had that zero day

644
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,360
exploit

645
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,600
and uh there was a mistake in the

646
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,880
networking

647
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,720
um so that kubernetes controller was

648
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,679
exposed the internet adversaries were

649
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,000
exploiting that vulnerability right away

650
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,720
right moore's law um hd more not the

651
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,799
computing

652
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,400
everyone had access to exploit everyone

653
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,240
was scanning and popping boxes like it

654
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,360
was christmas

655
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,760
and uh and they would get popped the

656
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,200
adversaries would stage tools the

657
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,320
adversaries would start to move

658
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,400
laterally that was identified as a

659
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,159
potential problem with that kubernetes

660
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,240
node the node was erased and reloaded

661
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,000
from ansible playbook the adversaries

662
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,360
were kicked out

663
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,039
this happened a few times until they

664
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,880
engage the the security instance

665
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,799
management process

666
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,039
so if we can erase and rebuild faster

667
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,200
than adversary can break in and stage we

668
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,159
win

669
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,640
awesome property uh in terms of

670
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,000
ephemeral environments

671
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,679
it's probably why two resilient

672
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,760
organizations are

673
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,400
more likely to have streamlined instant

674
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,159
response processes i believe that's

675
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,400
because we've thought through some of

676
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,159
the ways things can break and have put

677
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,799
in place playbooks in automation and

678
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,559
hopefully wherever possible are able to

679
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:45,360
just

680
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,840
execute these things and go

681
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,120
so that is the outcome of uh the sas

682
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,400
business case they were able to

683
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,360
integrate recovering continuity and ir

684
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,440
they're able to do it in partnership

685
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,360
with the head of product and the head of

686
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,000
security we've had a product maintaining

687
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,279
that as

688
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,240
a set of tools using devops and chaos

689
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,919
engineering principles

690
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,080
and the security team maintain the

691
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,840
governance for that

692
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,760
using traditional security concepts

693
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,720
popping over real quick to look in the

694
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,640
chat okay

695
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,320
so

696
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,480
let's look at the next business case

697
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,720
here

698
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,960
uh this one is in manufacturing so there

699
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,679
we were there we were right

700
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,360
they had a they had a business

701
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,840
continuity plan that's that's a start

702
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,400
it wasn't necessarily aligned with iso

703
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,320
which is the normal standards body for

704
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,559
manufacturing but they they did have a

705
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,400
plan

706
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,400
uh the the plan

707
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,440
put a

708
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,240
emphasis on availability for

709
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,360
um manufacturing lines manufacturing

710
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,240
plants so much like the financial

711
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,559
services where they put the emphasis on

712
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,799
fire drills uh and tested those very

713
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,880
rigorously here in the manufacturing

714
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,360
world they had the emphasis on

715
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,279
uh the plants and tested that very

716
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,919
rigorously plant level recovery was

717
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,000
great it worked fantastic everything was

718
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,960
good

719
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,399
however that didn't necessarily take

720
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,080
into account

721
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,679
your knowledge workers and everything

722
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,120
else and

723
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,320
due to acquisitions and due to the lack

724
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,880
of a central uh asset inventory

725
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,960
they had a million and one applications

726
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,240
lots and lots of applications

727
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,559
they also had a roadmap for network

728
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,880
refresh so their equipment cycle was

729
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,399
coming up

730
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,480
and they had a customer demand customer

731
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,480
demand to

732
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,880
meet a particular requirement for

733
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,440
continuity and recovery

734
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,200
so in this organization again thinking

735
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,799
about the context the financials of

736
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,799
stakeholders

737
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,480
the business case

738
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,399
was built around addressing that

739
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:03,120
customer need achieve tsax compliance to

740
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,279
be specific so they needed to address

741
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,960
that customer need i'm very pro

742
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,600
of the customer use case

743
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,080
because if we're protecting customer

744
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,440
revenue

745
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,000
and expanding customer

746
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,240
markets and everything by

747
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,480
by enabling the business through and

748
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,399
implementing security controls

749
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,880
what a great place to be in there's much

750
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,200
greater uh return i think you could

751
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,880
actually argue that is one of the few

752
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,240
areas where security can't have an roi

753
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,039
and there's much better budget

754
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,320
and greater support across the

755
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,720
organization for it so i really like

756
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,640
that context for a business case

757
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,880
financials are based on that customer

758
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,559
revenue we know we need to satisfy this

759
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,720
customer need or we're going to be in a

760
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,000
tough spot

761
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,720
the stakeholders are the heads of sales

762
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,640
uh the cio and the cso and the

763
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,799
management approach for this was

764
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,039
building a continuity recovery program

765
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,000
under the cso so basically upskilling

766
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,240
the current program which was facilities

767
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,360
based

768
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,360
to include

769
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,120
the it assets

770
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,000
and

771
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,880
in doing so do a full multi-year

772
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,720
business impact analysis where we look

773
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,320
at all those apps we look at all those

774
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:24,000
resources we figure out what's what

775
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,600
then the

776
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,120
implementation of that technical

777
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,520
implementation was going to be under the

778
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,200
cio as part of that network refresh

779
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,000
budget so when the refresh happened

780
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,919
taking advantage of that to shore up

781
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:41,360
the the network show up the

782
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,200
infrastructure and make sure that good

783
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,440
recovery and resiliency at that level

784
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,200
in doing this they found a lot of

785
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,360
different cost savings not only in the

786
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,600
refresh but also coming out of the

787
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,440
impact analysis

788
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,840
and they also position themselves very

789
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:02,000
well to respond to future events

790
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,159
when they executed it they

791
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,559
standardized the plan so they went back

792
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,120
to fundamentals they went back to the

793
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,520
the iso standard and they standardized

794
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,000
the plan and made sure that it was lined

795
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
up with the controls that were required

796
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,520
by t-stacks again that was the driver

797
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,679
right get t-sec certified keep the

798
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:20,840
customers

799
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,520
happy in doing the business impact

800
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,320
analysis which was a multi-year analysis

801
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,559
uh looking at all the apps figuring out

802
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,120
what those million what abs do

803
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,279
they noticed and identified a number of

804
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,520
different redundancies so

805
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,440
opportunities to cut this up or cut that

806
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,200
app to get rid of this or that or the

807
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,559
other to to simplify the environment

808
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,200
uh and to standardize the apps that the

809
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,200
various plants and business operation

810
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,440
units were using

811
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,240
so great opportunity to find a number of

812
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,480
different areas to cut and consolidate

813
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,039
and they were able to use that those

814
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,559
savings to then reinvest in the security

815
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:05,559
program

816
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,320
so

817
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,919
right i was mentioning business case

818
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:11,440
should solve a business need first and

819
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,159
then satisfy that need solve a secondary

820
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,159
outcome so in this example the secondary

821
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,360
outcome was

822
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,120
identifying those cost savings and

823
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,720
really rationalizing their application

824
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,159
inventory which is way out of control

825
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,240
which gets to uh another finding that we

826
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,600
see with organizations with good

827
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,360
resiliency they're much more likely to

828
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,559
have a cost-effective program

829
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:35,039
another light bulb moment

830
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,399
for me

831
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:37,840
occurred

832
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,000
when a

833
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,080
manufacturing line after implementing

834
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,440
this program

835
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,679
shoring up the bcdr

836
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:47,919
refreshing the network stack beginning

837
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,480
to consolidate apps um they actually

838
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,600
faced

839
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,640
a a malware situation uh where the

840
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,000
malware was spreading from plant to

841
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,279
plant to plant

842
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,200
and it was those lines those lines that

843
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,519
were modernized and put in place for

844
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,120
that customer need

845
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,039
which were unaffected they're segmented

846
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,840
off they would see the traffic coming in

847
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,360
they would recognize that it was

848
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,880
unwanted on uh unusual abnormal traffic

849
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,720
and they would communicate back to the

850
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,880
network uh environment you know you know

851
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,880
react access control and say hey isolate

852
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,080
this right we don't want this traffic

853
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,279
coming into us

854
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:24,000
and uh it kept the line up certainly but

855
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,519
also what was fascinating about that is

856
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:31,360
not only was the those areas unaffected

857
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,919
by this fast spreading malware

858
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,840
but it also became a detective tool

859
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,159
in cleaning it up because we could see

860
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,399
when it hit this these uh these lines

861
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:43,919
what was going on and what needed to

862
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,159
happen

863
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,600
so it's another example of how major

864
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,840
security instance can be

865
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,480
uh mitigated or minimized if you've got

866
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,720
good resiliency in place and a good

867
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,720
example of how

868
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,240
the security aspects of things detecting

869
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,240
when traffic is going awry

870
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,080
detecting when applications are going up

871
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,000
having a good application inventory how

872
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,919
those can all flow into a problem

873
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:12,480
management state so that you can be able

874
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,960
to respond very quickly have the i.t

875
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,519
team know what they need to do and feed

876
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:18,960
those into the

877
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,960
front line when we're actually tackling

878
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,039
a problem

879
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,399
all right so those are my three use

880
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,799
cases

881
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:30,640
ah

882
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,519
and uh i'm going to get into where

883
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,559
people go wrong in just a minute

884
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,960
as i pour myself a little more coffee

885
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,600
uh i see a a comment in the chat the

886
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,440
third case is actually similar to where

887
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,760
i am right now in healthcare customers

888
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,919
demanding a new certification now

889
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,919
customer demands

890
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,279
as a way of driving security is really

891
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,840
one of my favorite ways of

892
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,559
positioning things so because you get a

893
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:01,600
lot of support peer support from outside

894
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,240
just technology and of course the when

895
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,320
you're when you're talking dollars with

896
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,239
respect to customers

897
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:11,599
that was uh that was a major driver uh

898
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,119
for for revenue for funding for

899
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:14,560
everything else

900
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,800
support the culture everything else

901
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,320
question what was the certification the

902
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,560
plant was going for in a third example t

903
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:25,199
sacks t i s a x t sacks t stacks is an

904
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,440
exchange certification

905
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,320
uh that is maintained so if you are

906
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,159
t-sec certified

907
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,040
other

908
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,119
manufacturers can check that out and

909
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,760
rely on that as a certification

910
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,760
um so it's a it's a good way to reduce

911
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,719
your

912
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,440
uh number of audits from customers

913
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,399
and uh it is based on the iso standard

914
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,960
the the certification body is out of

915
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,280
europe

916
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,199
all right good questions okay moving

917
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,119
forward

918
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,200
as i get back to my slides

919
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,359
uh where do people go wrong

920
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,119
a couple years ago

921
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,920
at circle city con i gave a talk and the

922
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,240
clouds break at that point time i was

923
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,200
doing uh doing a lot of conversation a

924
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,560
lot of work

925
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,160
around

926
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,839
cloud continuity and recovery because

927
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:18,480
there's was at the time and i i i still

928
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,480
feel there is a little bit today

929
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,079
that uh there was this thought that if

930
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:22,960
you're on the cloud you don't need to

931
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,880
worry about continuity and recovery it's

932
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,520
fine everything is good someone else

933
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,359
will take care of it

934
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:32,800
uh i recently did a

935
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,119
a podcast

936
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,320
with w curtis preston and his book came

937
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,119
out

938
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,560
in may so if you are in a sas position

939
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,640
or you're looking to do

940
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,599
uh good recovery work

941
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,599
in that space i'd highly recommend his

942
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:52,079
book i've been reading uh reading

943
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,480
preston for years all his work is always

944
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,839
very good very thoughtful very well

945
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:01,040
constructed so his book is just out

946
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,359
and uh and thankfully with his book and

947
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,480
others there's been a lot more attention

948
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,839
on cloud data recovery

949
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:11,680
as part of that work

950
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,079
and moving forward this was in my

951
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,200
previous role uh before joining duo it's

952
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,280
part of that work in moving forward uh

953
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,480
during my consulting days and uh time

954
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,440
sense that in the clouds break talk

955
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,640
my team had the opportunity to review

956
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,160
176

957
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,720
business continuity plans so we read we

958
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,760
read 176 continuity plans

959
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,920
so you don't have to

960
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,000
when i say that way kind of sounds like

961
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,079
you know those cheesy bots like we made

962
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:44,320
a bot read a thousand different words

963
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,000
and now we have it creating a harry

964
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,839
potter script

965
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,200
it's it's like that and as a matter of

966
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,560
fact he can't read that business

967
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,280
continuity plan along the way

968
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,359
here are some of the ways that

969
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:59,760
these programs oftentimes go wrong

970
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,560
the the continuity and resiliency

971
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:06,480
efforts are owned by the wrong person

972
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,880
and

973
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,960
i gave you the example of the financial

974
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,359
services whereas owned by

975
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,680
you know project manager uh i gave the

976
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,520
example of the manufacturer whereas

977
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,839
owned by plan operations and i want to

978
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,359
stress both of those people are doing a

979
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,680
great job at their level awesome

980
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,880
fantastic

981
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,280
however

982
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,599
it's very common that we pass down

983
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,640
uh these programs to junior folks we

984
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,599
delegate too low and then we get

985
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:38,800
uh

986
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,440
you know concerns it's not

987
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,880
being done right

988
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,040
when i was talking to preston uh you

989
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,960
know again the gentleman who wrote the

990
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,280
book w curtis preston and his book in

991
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,040
cloud recovery i was on his podcast and

992
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,680
he was complaining that uh backups are

993
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,400
usually delegated to the most junior i.t

994
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,800
administrator and i was pointing out

995
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,760
that

996
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,599
continuity recovery plans are usually

997
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:03,599
delegated to the most junior security

998
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:04,720
analyst

999
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,760
and what we do is we rely on these

1000
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,240
things and we need to recover and resume

1001
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,240
when things happen it's it's just not

1002
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,599
it's not there it's not for lack of

1003
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,440
trying it's usually lack of them being

1004
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,800
equipped

1005
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,359
and having enough authority to execute

1006
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:23,520
i suspect i suspect that ransomware

1007
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,680
the the the spate of ransomware we've

1008
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,320
seen for five six years now is ongoing

1009
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,480
because we've got decades of technical

1010
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,119
debt that's accrued from delegating down

1011
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,520
too low so number one failure the wrong

1012
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,880
person

1013
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,000
um

1014
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,720
number two is is recovery at the wrong

1015
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,640
level you know if you got front end load

1016
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,160
balancers that's not going to protect

1017
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,040
your backend database uh if you've got

1018
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,640
great recovery

1019
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,480
uh for

1020
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,400
you know your your amazon sites but

1021
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,480
you've got a central source you know an

1022
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,839
oracle database that you're plugging

1023
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:58,240
into you're not gonna be protected that

1024
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,040
way so there's there's wrong technology

1025
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,880
load balancing

1026
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,119
and and site failovers and everything

1027
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,119
that are not necessarily applied across

1028
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:09,119
the the goal and both of these the wrong

1029
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,720
person the wrong technology are

1030
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,560
oftentimes not identified because we're

1031
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,240
doing the wrong testing we've got the

1032
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,320
wrong goals for testing we've got people

1033
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,839
who are doing these tests

1034
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:19,680
uh that don't necessarily apply right

1035
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,920
the fire drills which have nothing to do

1036
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,720
with the data center

1037
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:27,359
there's even more ways that we've seen

1038
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:29,680
this mucked up outsourcing is a big one

1039
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,839
it's not a cloud provider

1040
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,880
cloud provider handles it all they don't

1041
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,359
make sure they're testing your stuff

1042
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:39,440
because they don't uh non-standard

1043
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,720
language uh not using the right terms

1044
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,160
right that the

1045
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,079
um

1046
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,640
rpo and rto being confused are really

1047
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,880
good signs that this is a a plan that

1048
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,800
was not written the right way

1049
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,720
uh non-standard approach i'm not saying

1050
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:59,598
we need to foul nist or iso 22 301.

1051
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,760
i'm not saying that but i am saying that

1052
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,920
if you're a nist shop or iso shop you're

1053
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,599
in a much better place if you follow

1054
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:07,440
these standards and make sure you're

1055
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,000
addressing these controls

1056
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,800
there is a time and place to build a

1057
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,640
custom program

1058
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,960
but the time and place is oftentimes not

1059
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,240
in the resiliency where you need

1060
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,400
something very standard very portable

1061
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,560
that can be handed from team to team or

1062
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,280
organization organization

1063
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,040
uh trend addresses high availability

1064
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,760
it's cool we got h.a

1065
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,200
all right

1066
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,000
have you tested it is everything in h.a

1067
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,240
what happens at the failover point what

1068
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,920
about data corruption uh and that

1069
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,000
back to that asteroid falling that was

1070
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,640
one of the the most painful experiences

1071
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,400
of my life was when i was handling a

1072
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,920
uh disaster recovery scenario that

1073
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,359
really was the asteroid you know if

1074
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:53,680
everything's down we're good but it had

1075
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,599
they had had a series of rolling

1076
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,760
failovers so you had corrupt

1077
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,359
transactions that had to be rolled off

1078
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:02,000
you had file mismatches you had a file

1079
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,440
system that wouldn't mount oh this is

1080
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,359
terrible

1081
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:06,880
not going to be protected with h.a

1082
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,440
overly broad plans

1083
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,240
yeah

1084
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,319
it's in the cloud provider we got it

1085
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:15,359
don't look at what's in the data center

1086
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,440
only specific plans

1087
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,119
we know exactly what we will do for

1088
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:21,760
covid the next time it hits

1089
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,920
okay but what about any other

1090
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,560
pandemic or any other widespread uh

1091
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,000
impact to your workforce we will get ppe

1092
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,359
and we'll give people their coveted

1093
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:32,560
vaccines

1094
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,520
it's

1095
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,440
black swan events are black swan events

1096
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,359
for a reason they almost never occur so

1097
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:38,960
building a plan for a black swan event

1098
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,599
is a terrible idea yet everyone is doing

1099
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,680
it right now why because we're still

1100
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,280
emerging from covet

1101
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,520
much better to say let's build a plan

1102
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,680
for something that's swan shaped like an

1103
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,839
unnamed goose if we got an unnamed goose

1104
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:52,800
plan

1105
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,880
that can address a whole bunch of bird

1106
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,960
shaped things we're in a good spot

1107
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,800
that's what you want to aim for but all

1108
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,440
too often it's overly specific

1109
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,119
handled in isolation so there's

1110
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,560
different asset management different

1111
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,160
risk rankings not tied in with the

1112
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,079
overall programs

1113
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,319
so these are the main ways that these

1114
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:13,359
things get mucked up

1115
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:16,800
comment is it's usually called the

1116
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,200
backup team not the backup and recovery

1117
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,960
team

1118
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,640
too true

1119
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,800
recover test the recovery why why should

1120
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,400
we

1121
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,560
uh is the problem with the cloud that

1122
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,160
people never test their backups or that

1123
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,680
they configure their availability

1124
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,599
incorrectly or something else great

1125
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,520
question the problem with the cloud

1126
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,720
is

1127
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,280
a couple things one organizations often

1128
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,079
don't think to back up it's in the cloud

1129
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:45,760
it's running why should i have to worry

1130
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,280
about a backup

1131
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,319
um

1132
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,880
well because things go wrong well but

1133
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,880
we've got cloud multiple cloud instances

1134
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,280
okay but what happens when

1135
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,680
multiples go wrong or

1136
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,000
when you get uh corrupted data such as

1137
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,520
ransomware

1138
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,079
so in part it's because they don't do

1139
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,640
backups if they do backups another

1140
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,800
aspect of the problem is that a lot of

1141
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,160
cloud software being open source doesn't

1142
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,800
necessarily do full encrypted backups

1143
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,119
it's working with a company recently in

1144
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,599
the advisory capacity and we're talking

1145
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:21,520
about backups like oh yeah i think we've

1146
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,359
got that configured but we can't do a a

1147
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:27,280
incremental backup and we can't encrypt

1148
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,480
our backups without buying the

1149
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,680
commercial software version

1150
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,920
yeah they must never have had an ec2

1151
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,079
instant stop or fail or lose their

1152
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:40,000
ephemeral source correct you don't

1153
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,920
really think about these things until

1154
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,119
something terrible happens

1155
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,319
all right let's uh let's talk about

1156
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:52,640
moving from recovery to resiliency

1157
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,119
one of the key things

1158
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:57,440
that recovery allows you to do is know

1159
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,280
what matters and know what to do about

1160
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,560
it that is the most important part

1161
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,119
about this doing the impact analysis

1162
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:06,800
mapping out your processes mapping out

1163
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,839
your assets

1164
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,040
from there we can go ahead and plug in

1165
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,480
resiliency into a couple of different

1166
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,599
places

1167
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,280
i love to see plugging in the soccer the

1168
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,720
noc

1169
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,240
so this asset means this is supporting

1170
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,160
this business process it's our key

1171
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,160
business process and health care it's

1172
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,760
you know protecting a patient's uh

1173
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,240
health and safety in financial services

1174
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,200
it's uh what's allowing us to to trade

1175
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,520
that's our key process we want to

1176
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,400
prioritize in the sock or the knock

1177
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,640
those processes accordingly

1178
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,040
uh same thing feed that into the

1179
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,240
the cert

1180
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,119
uh same thing feed them to the grc and

1181
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:49,200
have those back flowing too right so

1182
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,000
when your grc program is updating risk

1183
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,720
rankings or making recommendations

1184
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,440
across all three areas we've got a

1185
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,839
similar understanding of what this stuff

1186
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:03,440
means and what we need to do about it

1187
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,440
a surprising finding when we were

1188
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,000
looking at 4800 security professionals

1189
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,440
what they do and what they get

1190
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,200
surprising finding was that folks who

1191
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,800
are doing resiliency

1192
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,319
were more likely to retain top talent

1193
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:18,560
you wouldn't think that would be true

1194
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,640
right because backups and recovery are

1195
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,160
boring and

1196
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,960
documentation is boring and everything

1197
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,640
that i talk about is usually boring uh

1198
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,839
so why is that why is it

1199
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:35,599
when you look at people who worked in ir

1200
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:36,960
or in stock

1201
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,760
and have burned tons of time

1202
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,200
trying to solve a problem because they

1203
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,200
noticed unusual traffic

1204
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,839
only to realize that that was a new

1205
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:47,440
application or they noticed some very

1206
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,800
specific uh suspicious activity only to

1207
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,560
realize that was on a guest network that

1208
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,079
no one cares about

1209
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:54,960
how

1210
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,200
many times can that happen before you're

1211
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,079
like

1212
00:45:58,079 --> 00:45:59,920
this place is a garbage fire i'm gonna

1213
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,440
go get another job

1214
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,319
if you if you do work in security you

1215
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:06,560
want your work to count in the matter so

1216
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,119
you need a way of making sure that

1217
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:11,599
happens

1218
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,680
uh some other additional integration

1219
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,200
points i already mentioned seam and

1220
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,119
vulnerability management i really like

1221
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:21,040
to feed these things into your pam and

1222
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,119
pam programs so

1223
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:25,280
this high secure environment

1224
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,839
is only accessible through just-in-time

1225
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,200
access

1226
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,880
data loss prevention certainly with

1227
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,079
classification ueba certainly so we know

1228
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:36,960
the behavior is right now

1229
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,440
the trick to this is to look at all

1230
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,119
these and look at what's mature and

1231
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:43,359
what's available to you and make that

1232
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:45,119
integration point

1233
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:46,079
the

1234
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:47,920
caution i would give is don't say i

1235
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,960
can't do bcdr until i've got good ueba

1236
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,400
or i can't do

1237
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,319
pim and pam until i get good dr we want

1238
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:57,680
to mature what we can but for the

1239
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,520
portions the capabilities are running

1240
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,280
well and really mature

1241
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,359
link those up together to provide an

1242
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:06,720
overall unified view

1243
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,480
and also remember not to separate

1244
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,119
resiliency from the organization

1245
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,880
i'm talking predominantly today about

1246
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,560
resiliency as an i.t function and

1247
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,640
therefore a part of the domain of cyber

1248
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,119
security of course resiliency affects

1249
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:21,040
more than i.t

1250
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,960
we want to start with the business case

1251
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,200
for continuity and recovery and response

1252
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,559
start there

1253
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:28,800
be very careful not to silo it off from

1254
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,920
other broader initiatives

1255
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,359
from there exercise exercise exercise

1256
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:37,359
not just fire drills

1257
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:39,359
i've got an exercise maturity model i've

1258
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,599
shared before i'll cover it again here

1259
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:42,800
briefly

1260
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,640
but you want to start off with here's

1261
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:47,359
our story something's down whatever and

1262
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:49,359
have those stories on ad hoc basis maybe

1263
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:51,359
we're team meetings

1264
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:53,119
open office hours

1265
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:55,040
level two you want to firm up those

1266
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,520
scenarios the stories and the scenarios

1267
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,599
and do a formal tabletop with the right

1268
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:01,760
people and not only would just do the

1269
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,920
technical one but also business facing

1270
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,599
and with your peers so that you can make

1271
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:07,440
sure that you've got good understanding

1272
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,040
of what needs to happen

1273
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,400
now that you're doing that on a regular

1274
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,240
basis maybe that's a quarterly maybe

1275
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,440
that's monthly

1276
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,720
um take some of your best scenarios

1277
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,839
tie them to very specific tactics and

1278
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:21,359
controls and test those tactics and

1279
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:23,520
controls technically

1280
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,440
from that we want to line it up to an

1281
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,280
overall framework and run those

1282
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,119
exercises in parallel so you not only do

1283
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:31,440
the tabletop but introduce evidence turn

1284
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,440
things off flipped over tables whatever

1285
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,480
it takes

1286
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,200
to make sure that things are working

1287
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,559
and then as we go to level five

1288
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:42,960
automate that automate the heck out of

1289
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,800
it right think of the chaos monkey and

1290
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,800
the work that's being done

1291
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,800
and chaos security engineering where

1292
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,720
this is an ongoing process that's

1293
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,599
automated and regular and allows us to

1294
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:56,800
do continuous improvement

1295
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,920
from there we want to measure our

1296
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,200
performance

1297
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,359
from business impact analysis to

1298
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:05,599
increasing the number of our scenarios

1299
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:07,680
to increasing the number of tactics that

1300
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,800
we've got

1301
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,040
traditional metrics like rto how long it

1302
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,800
takes to recover rpl and point your

1303
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,000
recovery 2

1304
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,280
and restoration after recovery

1305
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,440
as well as ir time to detection

1306
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,079
remediation so measure your progress and

1307
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:23,680
make sure that you're driving that up

1308
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,760
the measurement really comes at about

1309
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,000
level three it's it's not where you

1310
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,839
start to where you're going

1311
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,440
all right i'll conclude this and then

1312
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,839
i'll answer any final questions in the

1313
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:39,839
discord and then uh then we're done

1314
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,079
the next time uh

1315
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:43,440
the next time you're in the building

1316
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,200
you're sending an elevator

1317
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,839
i'd encourage you to look down

1318
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:50,079
see which elevator it is

1319
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:52,319
uh it's probably an otis it might not be

1320
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:53,359
a notice

1321
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:55,760
but it probably isn't otis

1322
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,000
the story of the elevator is actually a

1323
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,160
security story

1324
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,520
otis

1325
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,680
comes from the man otis the gentleman

1326
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,599
who's the namesake of those elevators

1327
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:06,800
and he didn't actually invent the

1328
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,200
elevator no he didn't he invented the

1329
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,079
break

1330
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:11,599
and he would

1331
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:13,760
uh go out in the 19th century his name

1332
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,920
was elisha elisha otis who got the 19th

1333
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,760
century and he would have people with

1334
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:18,880
ropes

1335
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,240
pulling them up

1336
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,480
two three four stories of the air on a

1337
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,599
platform

1338
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:25,280
and have a big crowd around him there

1339
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,640
was so much to do in 19th century we

1340
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,000
didn't have twitter

1341
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,559
so he would hug crowd around to see this

1342
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:32,319
guy who was about to break his neck and

1343
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,079
then they would cut the rope and he

1344
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:37,040
would fall on this makeshift elevator

1345
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,800
fall

1346
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,359
sometimes as much as a story

1347
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:43,040
until the break the automatic break

1348
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,359
kicked in

1349
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:46,800
otis elevator

1350
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,599
named for the elisha otis who never did

1351
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:51,200
die from these stunts surprisingly

1352
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,319
enough um otis elevator company patented

1353
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:56,559
the break in 1913

1354
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:59,839
and it was about 20 years after that

1355
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:02,480
that we started seeing some crazy tall

1356
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,559
buildings uh including the empire state

1357
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:06,319
building and everything else

1358
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:08,960
the security control the break

1359
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:13,119
was what allowed us to reach for the sky

1360
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:14,000
so

1361
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,920
that enabled the last great migration

1362
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,240
where we moved from country to city we

1363
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,559
were moved from the first floor to the

1364
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:23,200
top floor a lot of interesting stories

1365
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,559
in there but it was the last great

1366
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:26,960
migration till this migration the

1367
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,200
migration we're in now we removed

1368
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,240
everything

1369
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,720
not from one place to another

1370
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,359
but from physical to virtual

1371
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:36,880
and as a matter of fact if you look at

1372
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,240
where most people today are building uh

1373
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:43,040
their companies uh building their lives

1374
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:47,279
it's online right it's all online

1375
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,280
why bring that up is

1376
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,559
we're in the midst of the greatest

1377
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:52,400
migration in our lifetime the first

1378
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,240
migration that's been largely physical

1379
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,599
to virtual

1380
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:59,040
and that puts incredible importance on

1381
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,640
resiliency

1382
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,119
resiliency is that elevator break

1383
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:05,520
resiliency the resiliency we're building

1384
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,119
today

1385
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:08,960
that resiliency is what's going to make

1386
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,280
possible tomorrow's wonders

1387
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,720
it's going to be really fascinating to

1388
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,240
see what happens 10 years from now

1389
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,400
so moving forward you know

1390
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,280
look at ways to to build the business

1391
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,839
case i've got a couple examples today

1392
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:26,640
um make sure you gap assess your

1393
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,400
programs and figure out how to integrate

1394
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,040
them continuity recovery ir problem

1395
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,559
management

1396
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:35,280
and determine what areas need uh

1397
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,400
investment

1398
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,520
close those gaps run exercises use that

1399
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:42,240
to drive up your your program

1400
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:46,000
and uh and and do it and don't forget to

1401
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:46,960
do it

1402
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,880
because the zombies are coming and if we

1403
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,359
don't run our zombie preparedness plan

1404
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:54,960
what the heck will we do

1405
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,240
all right let me look one more time for

1406
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,839
anything left in discord

1407
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,319
there's a comment that a lot of the

1408
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:10,400
problem with cloud is the issue the

1409
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,720
recovery process itself

1410
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,640
says well i do love terraform i found

1411
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,559
many devs will often not take backups

1412
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:18,319
into account exactly they don't they're

1413
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:19,920
trying to build stuff right there their

1414
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,920
whole idea is not let's put brakes in

1415
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,440
the elevator the whole idea is build the

1416
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,119
tallest building that's why we need to

1417
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:28,160
be thinking about the brakes

1418
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,520
and most people don't understand what

1419
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,480
offline backups mean yes yes so true so

1420
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:33,760
when you think about some of the more

1421
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,760
advanced ransomware tactics what do they

1422
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:39,119
do they compromise your backups first

1423
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:40,960
there was a very

1424
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,280
interesting one that was going out

1425
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:47,440
and uh tackling msp so compromising msp

1426
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,880
push out a command to delete all the

1427
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,520
backups push out a command to disable av

1428
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,599
on the endpoints and push out ransomware

1429
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:56,559
to all the endpoints

1430
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:59,359
ah so yeah most people don't really have

1431
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:02,640
an understanding of backups and backups

1432
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:06,079
disaster recovery instant response these

1433
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,000
are not necessarily things that people

1434
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,160
can just read up on the internet and

1435
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,640
jump in and do it really does require

1436
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,280
a degree of expertise and it requires a

1437
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:18,880
degree of experience to get it right

1438
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:22,640
all right i know i'm at time so thank

1439
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,880
