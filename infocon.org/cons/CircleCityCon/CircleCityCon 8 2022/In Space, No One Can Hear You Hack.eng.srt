[Music]

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,360
wow

3
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,160
all right i am live i'm going to track

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,199
one

5
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:22,960
all right thank you everybody thank you

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,439
for coming to my presentation um this

7
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,160
presentation of course is entitled

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,560
in space uh no one can hear you hack uh

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,800
we're going to talk about

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,719
uh getting started in space hacking like

11
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,480
what does it take to you know start

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,000
doing um

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,680
you know satellite hacking interacting

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,640
with them

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,120
grabbing data etc

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,200
uh so before we get started

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,920
let me introduce myself uh my name is

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,440
caitlin handelman

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,160
i work for ntt data now at ntt is sort

20
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,960
of like the att of japan stands for

21
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,760
nippon telephone and telegraph

22
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,320
and my role is a security engineer

23
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,440
now

24
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,360
what's really interesting is that

25
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,040
there's a bit of a secret i'm not

26
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,200
allowed to disclose this

27
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,680
everywhere but for the sake of this

28
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,320
presentation making sense

29
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,119
i'm going to tell you right now um

30
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,759
where i actually work most of the time

31
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,080
almost all the time is at nasa

32
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,119
so

33
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,360
uh yeah that's why i'm talking about

34
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,880
hacking stuff in space that's why it

35
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,880
relates to my job most of the time i'm

36
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,400
at nasa

37
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,560
and i work on projects

38
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,920
involving aerospace um and uh

39
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,680
yeah um

40
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,200
so so the reason why it's a bit of a

41
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,600
secret or at least an open secret i

42
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,079
should say is because

43
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,840
i don't want to get targeted you know

44
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,240
nasa is a government organization

45
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,320
um you know if i put it out on twitter

46
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,640
and stuff it becomes a big problem but

47
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,759
you can know you can know it's okay

48
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,560
all right so why am i doing this um

49
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,320
i'm learning too and i'll get into that

50
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,479
in a second and you remember about ten

51
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,000
percent of what you are taught and

52
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,040
ninety percent of what you teach

53
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,360
uh track one speaker let's see um

54
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,959
is this better

55
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,400
is the volume better someone said that

56
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,360
my volume's low

57
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,399
uh waiting for a response

58
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,720
uh someone is typing

59
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,640
let's see

60
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,760
uh

61
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,040
it's

62
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,319
low for me too okay um

63
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,080
how's this

64
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,400
is this better

65
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,280
um

66
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,800
all right well this is as loud as the

67
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,440
microphone gets i think

68
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,760
um

69
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,640
okay hopefully hopefully you can you can

70
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,160
hear me you can turn up your volume i'm

71
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,680
sorry about that

72
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,160
uh so anyway um before we go get started

73
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,200
let me tell you a bit about my

74
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,920
background um so before i was working at

75
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,239
ntt data

76
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,040
i was working uh at uh let's see hold on

77
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,120
someone has messaged me about my audio

78
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,760
audio it's great huh

79
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,200
um

80
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,519
yeah my mic is is very close actually

81
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,920
you can see it's right here uh the gain

82
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,519
is turned all the way up

83
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,920
i'm not sure why

84
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,720
uh

85
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,360
what's going on with the audio um i'm

86
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,239
getting told that the audio is fine

87
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,920
i don't want to spend too much time

88
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,798
debugging this

89
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,920
so uh tip for anyone who might be too

90
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,480
quiet installed the

91
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,599
extension uh thank you uh dmis

92
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,200
okay so let me tell you a bit about my

93
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,280
about my background what i was doing

94
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,680
before i was working at ntt data

95
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,840
so before i was working at ntt data i

96
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,440
was

97
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,440
working with kindergarteners i was a

98
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,840
school teacher actually

99
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,519
and

100
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,360
in my spare time

101
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,599
i was doing computers and hacking and

102
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,200
stuff and i actually didn't think i was

103
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,480
that good i mean compared to the

104
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,720
professionals i mean oh my gosh

105
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,120
i'm i'm nobody

106
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,920
uh

107
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,799
and also in my spare time

108
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,680
i found a love of astronomy

109
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,519
and so i found myself

110
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,358
working with local groups to teach the

111
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,199
community about

112
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,519
astronomy what the stars were what stars

113
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,960
were out and constellations around at

114
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,639
the time

115
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,800
you know how to use telescopes

116
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,360
etc and i started getting involved in

117
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,840
hacking competitions and ctfs and it

118
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,000
turns out i'm actually like pretty good

119
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,400
i didn't even realize it

120
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,919
so uh

121
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,560
i got a call um and it turns out i was

122
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,800
just you know a perfect fit and

123
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,800
before this presentation someone asked

124
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,400
you know how do i get into aerospace how

125
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,639
do i get into this field

126
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:49,680
and my

127
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,960
recommendation

128
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,360
to anyone is

129
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,960
it really

130
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,800
really focus on on what you're doing

131
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,400
outside of work

132
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,400
i mean it's great that you go to school

133
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,560
you know and you you continue to learn

134
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,080
uh but what's really going to land you

135
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,479
the job in the field that you want is is

136
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,479
passion that goes you know beyond what

137
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,479
you're doing so like i said in my case i

138
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,360
was doing ctfs i was doing

139
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,680
uh the ccdc which is the collegiate you

140
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,400
know cyber defense and cyber penetration

141
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,880
testing um competitions

142
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,039
um so i was you know pretty busy and

143
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,560
just doing things outside and i didn't

144
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,400
really have a goal to get into aerospace

145
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,880
just that my interests uh and what i was

146
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,039
doing outside of work in school just

147
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,600
aligned in that way

148
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,120
um

149
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,360
all right anyway so all right let's talk

150
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,240
about getting into space

151
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,120
um

152
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,800
so in order to get into space there's

153
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,479
something called the rocket equation now

154
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:45,919
they tell you

155
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,600
this is this is you know a secret when

156
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,960
you give a presentation don't show

157
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,880
equations but this one is super

158
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,400
important

159
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,840
you really need to understand this in

160
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,600
order to understand what's going on with

161
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,800
rockets

162
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,960
and essentially what this equation says

163
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,520
is that let me get out my annotation

164
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,479
tool

165
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,199
is that the initial mass

166
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,520
over the final mass so you start out

167
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,919
with mass with fuel and mass without

168
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,280
fuel

169
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,440
um and a certain efficiency of the

170
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,800
rocket

171
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,639
and that gives you

172
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,960
the amount of total velocity so that's

173
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,720
what the delta v stands for it means

174
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,199
change in velocity or change in speed

175
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,759
so your total change in speed has to do

176
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,479
with your engine efficiency

177
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,479
and your fuel

178
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,880
so what does this mean uh basically this

179
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,800
explains why rockets

180
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,319
have stages

181
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,919
so what happens is you have a big rock

182
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,000
at the bottom and it uses up a lot of

183
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,720
its mass and then when it's done it

184
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,120
shoves it off and then you start with

185
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,039
the smaller rockets um and this is

186
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,680
basically our entire space program

187
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,000
and this is this is rocket science

188
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,400
distilled into one equation uh and if

189
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,080
you're wondering if anyone says oh it's

190
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,319
rocket science it's so hard no this is

191
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,000
rocket science this is this is all

192
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,759
you're dealing with mostly i mean

193
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:04,639
there's

194
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,680
very mechanical and you know engineering

195
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,199
stuff you have to deal with but the main

196
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,400
thing you're dealing with is this

197
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,759
equation

198
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,240
uh let me um let's figure out how to get

199
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,520
rid of

200
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,639
annotations clear all drawings okay

201
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,960
now let's go on

202
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,360
math okay

203
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,840
uh so right so let's talk about a few uh

204
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,560
important rocketry terms yes yes you are

205
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,160
uh uh kedo potato says yes uh we're we

206
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,520
learned rocket science you did that was

207
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,680
it that was rocket science

208
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,039
you are now ready to start building

209
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,199
rockets everything after that is just

210
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,800
getting into details

211
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,199
um i can't make out a word what is going

212
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,720
on what if i um reduce the gain

213
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,520
is this better

214
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,520
yeah people are saying something's going

215
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,440
on with the audio and i don't know

216
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,120
what's going on

217
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,360
uh i'm getting let me look in the green

218
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,440
room here

219
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,520
um you're fine audio is great as long as

220
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,719
you're facing the mic yeah

221
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,039
yeah so i'm being told that the audio is

222
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,160
coming in good on on

223
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,160
uh through zoom so i don't know what's

224
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,039
going on on your ends um definitely not

225
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,639
not my end so i wish i could do more

226
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,680
okay

227
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,879
uh anyway so uh so in rocketry terms if

228
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,479
you start getting into a lot of rocketry

229
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,479
you're gonna hear hear these terms come

230
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,240
up a lot uh the first one we heard about

231
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,000
before delta v

232
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,240
which is just once again change in

233
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,640
velocity that's all all it is

234
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,880
uh can you go from 10 miles per hour to

235
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,519
20 miles per hour that's 10 miles per

236
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,519
hour of delta v

237
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,039
you have something called specific

238
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,080
impulse

239
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,399
which once again is just a complicated

240
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,720
term meaning engine efficiency how

241
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,040
efficient is it do you take

242
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,600
a gallon of fuel to go 10 miles per hour

243
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,560
faster or just one ounce of fuel

244
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,640
uh thrust to weight ratio

245
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,560
okay so we do have certain rockets that

246
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,240
are really efficient

247
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,480
super efficient but we don't lift off

248
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,880
with them because they're too weak think

249
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,279
of like ion drives

250
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,560
so one of the

251
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,839
important things you're looking at when

252
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,680
you're launching specifically on a

253
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,320
planet is how much thrust you get versus

254
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,240
how much your your

255
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,680
rocket weighs and that's called the

256
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,480
thrust to weight ratio and we already

257
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,480
mentioned this but staging

258
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,720
is when you have a

259
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,519
bigger rocket carrying a smaller rocket

260
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,760
carrying a smaller rocket on top of that

261
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,760
and you go in stages so it's the big

262
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,760
rocket that falls away then you go to

263
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,200
the next stage and it's the smaller

264
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,120
rocket that falls away and then finally

265
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,200
you get to the final stage of the little

266
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,160
itty bitty rocket

267
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,480
and of course we have to talk a little

268
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,480
bit about orbits because that's what

269
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,440
we're going to be dealing with when

270
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,120
we're talking about uh hacking

271
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,680
satellites

272
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,440
uh so

273
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,480
uh

274
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,959
orbits are never almost never perfectly

275
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,560
circular you're gonna have a

276
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,640
they're always gonna usually be in like

277
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,880
an oval shape like this

278
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,720
like you see on the screen

279
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,920
and the near part of the orbit is called

280
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,680
the periapsis

281
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,079
or you might have hear it if it's

282
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,040
in relation to earth the perigee

283
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,920
likewise the far side of the orbit is

284
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,600
called the apoapsis

285
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,720
or the apogee and many of you

286
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,519
who are into computers may have

287
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,200
heard that term before because a big

288
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,839
software developer back in the early 90s

289
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,680
was of course apogee

290
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,800
and there

291
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,640
logo was a rocket

292
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,600
in high orbit

293
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,800
and of course a lot of orbits

294
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,320
you know go straight across the equator

295
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,160
but usually they don't usually they're

296
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,320
at some sort of incline

297
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,519
and we call that the angle of

298
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,360
inclination

299
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,959
and when

300
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,320
a satellite passes over the equator we

301
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,920
call that the ascending node

302
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,680
all right six words you never want to

303
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,120
hear to say at nasa

304
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,360
it works in criminal space program so i

305
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,519
have a i have a uh

306
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,240
i have a confession uh what really got

307
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,920
me interested in rocketry in the first

308
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,959
place is of course kerbal space program

309
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,040
and uh

310
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,000
um

311
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,240
i'm one of the few people at nasa who

312
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,000
got in primarily um through a uh

313
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
extensive use of that program um

314
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,880
and uh let's see

315
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,880
uh let's talk a little let's all right

316
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,880
so now we have the basic understanding

317
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,120
of how orbits work

318
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,560
let's talk a little bit about cyber

319
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,200
security in space

320
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,640
and here we have a diagram of a

321
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,480
satellite and we can see it's made up of

322
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,560
a lot of different components

323
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,720
hint a lot of these have

324
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,320
cyber security flaws you have antennas

325
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,320
connected to sdrs connected to a bunch

326
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,160
of computers connected on a network i

327
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,639
mean it's it's it can be a mess even on

328
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,639
a single satellite

329
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,160
all right so what does a communication

330
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,639
process with a satellite look like

331
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,720
well it starts off with your normal

332
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,480
everyday tcp

333
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,399
data stream that you're used to all the

334
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,440
time

335
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,880
so you have a flight control station on

336
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,160
the ground

337
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,839
and then there's some sort of usually a

338
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,760
cryptographic process

339
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,000
that

340
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,680
that the data will go through before

341
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,440
being sent

342
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,560
um if i can get my tools out uh not

343
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,959
spotlight straw here we go so we start

344
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,839
with the flight control station

345
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:34,639
and then there's some sort of

346
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,279
cryptographic process

347
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,399
and then

348
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,480
it goes through an sdr what's an sdr

349
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,160
it's a software-defined radio we're

350
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,680
going to talk a lot about those in this

351
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,600
presentation

352
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,440
um and then of course it gets sent from

353
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,440
the scr to the antenna

354
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,040
from the antenna

355
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,600
then we go to the space vehicle antenna

356
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,320
another software defined radio on

357
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,279
the

358
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,639
space vehicle

359
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,880
and then we undo the crypto

360
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,880
go through some sort of data handler on

361
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,680
the device on the

362
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,600
on the space vehicle and then finally to

363
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,040
the fly computer

364
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,800
and that's once again to get sent back

365
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,639
into tcpip data

366
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,720
so in a lot of ways the communication on

367
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,279
board the satellite

368
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,880
and onboard the

369
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,959
uh you know ground station is very

370
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,639
similar to your wi-fi that you're very

371
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,240
used to

372
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,360
and in fact uh wi-fi uh uses its own

373
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,720
software to find radios as well

374
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,680
um

375
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,240
anyway

376
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,320
next slide

377
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,959
um so let's look a little bit closer at

378
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,800
the bus on the space vehicle what's

379
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,320
going on

380
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,480
so you have the antenna

381
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,240
that once again goes to the sdr that

382
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,720
goes to the data handler now normally

383
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,199
uh the developers of the space vehicles

384
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,160
are

385
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,680
not complete

386
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,760
you know

387
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,480
noobs to security so they split things

388
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,360
up uh so you have uh

389
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,120
the flight computer which controls

390
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,720
everything from

391
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,199
you know how the spacecraft spacecraft

392
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,279
operates so you have

393
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,800
the flight controller will control

394
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,880
something called a torque rod

395
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,519
which is essentially magnets

396
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,360
if you're in low earth orbit and you

397
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,760
want to rotate your spacecraft you can

398
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,680
use something called a torque rod

399
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,519
which will

400
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,920
align itself with earth's magnetic field

401
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,360
and you essentially get free rotation

402
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,440
out of it pretty cool stuff of course if

403
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,680
you are outside of

404
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,480
earth's orbit um or low earth orbit i

405
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,480
should say then you will use something

406
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,120
called a flywheel now a flywheel is the

407
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,360
same thing in this case as a gyroscope

408
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,519
people who are familiar with flywheels

409
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,320
in terms of

410
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,399
you know gearing uh no it's an energy

411
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,320
storage system but when you're talking

412
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,000
about space vehicles the flywheels are

413
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,160
essentially used for you know rotating

414
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,760
if you rotate a wheel clockwise your

415
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,560
spacecraft will turn counterclockwise so

416
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,560
you can use that to rotate the

417
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,480
the spacecraft essentially for free so

418
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,600
rotational

419
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,440
turning of your spacecraft can be done

420
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,959
without expending fuel but of course

421
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,040
sometimes you do need to expend fuel

422
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,360
especially if your flywheels for example

423
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,480
get saturated which happens very often

424
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,320
so in that case if your flywheels get

425
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,760
saturated or you need to move it or

426
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,760
nudge your spacecraft in some way

427
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,800
you can use something called the

428
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,880
reaction control system

429
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,120
and that is essentially usually some

430
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,320
sort of

431
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,360
uh rocket fuel that does not require

432
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,360
um hydrogen or oxygen it's usually

433
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,759
something called a mono propellant

434
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,360
so it's something like hydrazine and the

435
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,800
reason why you would use something like

436
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,839
hydrazine in space is because you cannot

437
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,199
have failures

438
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,199
when things go wrong in space they stay

439
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:45,920
raw

440
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,079
you can't go up and fix things

441
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,360
so

442
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,519
so yeah rcs systems generally tend to

443
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,519
use a mono propellant

444
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,120
and but of course sometimes you have

445
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,959
thrusters as well if you are sending out

446
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,560
something like a

447
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,320
probe to pluto

448
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,079
where you really need it to have like an

449
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,199
ion

450
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,519
drive or ion thruster you might have

451
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,720
that as well connected to the fly

452
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,800
computer and these are all just for

453
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,120
movement and that is completely separate

454
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,320
from the payload because you do not want

455
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,320
what is happening on your

456
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,839
sensors on your cameras on your

457
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:20,639
you know

458
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,320
ion detection systems to affect how the

459
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,480
how the space vehicle is moving

460
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,920
so you have a split um

461
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,959
and

462
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,600
so the sensors are usually on a separate

463
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,240
bus than the rest of the the systems on

464
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,120
a space vehicle

465
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,079
yeah now you want to play cable yes do

466
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,079
do like i said that's how i got

467
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,320
net working with nasa uh

468
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,120
lots of kerbal space program definitely

469
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,160
um yeah yeah that says nasa's

470
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,040
gonna have some hard times ahead uh with

471
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,839
with uh me uh in there anyway

472
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,680
uh so there are different types of space

473
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,800
vehicles

474
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,639
basically where they and then and we

475
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,640
define them based on where they are in

476
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,760
orbit

477
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,000
so the most common type of space vehicle

478
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,839
you're going to deal with are called low

479
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,520
earth orbit vehicles and these are

480
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,359
things like starlink which orbit just

481
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,119
above the atmosphere in fact they scrape

482
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,480
the atmosphere

483
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,039
very uh

484
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,520
on purpose because we one of the ways

485
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,839
that we can get spacecraft down is

486
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,359
through friction with the atmosphere

487
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,799
over time

488
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,280
and so if it goes too high it won't

489
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,360
shape the atmosphere so we want you know

490
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,200
the low earth orbits

491
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,440
uh to do that um and then of course we

492
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,120
have medium earth orbits which are sort

493
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,559
of in between

494
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,919
kind of orbits like they're not scraping

495
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,360
the atmosphere but they're not too far

496
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,679
off we use that for gps

497
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,840
uh we have geostationary orbits which

498
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,280
just means that the orbit takes 24 hours

499
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,120
so the further out your orbit is the

500
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,640
longer it takes

501
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,240
and if you

502
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,400
put it out put it out at a very specific

503
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,360
distance

504
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,280
it'll take 24 hours so the orbit so the

505
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,799
space vehicle will look like it's in the

506
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,799
same place in the sky

507
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,720
uh all year round

508
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,320
and of course after that we have deep

509
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,200
space uh probes and this is for things

510
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,400
like voyager 1 and 2 mars etc anything

511
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,880
outs anything beyond geostationary orbit

512
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,559
including the moon is considered deep

513
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,080
space

514
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,919
so what can possibly go wrong yes a lot

515
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,200
of things

516
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,280
everything goes wrong in space

517
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,960
you have you know radiation prime the

518
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,039
electronics all the time temperature

519
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,200
swings um going between you know 300

520
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,120
degrees celsius and negative 200 degrees

521
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,559
celsius whatever

522
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,559
um i'm just

523
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,160
throwing things out um you know

524
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,919
collisions

525
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,679
kessler syndrome if you know what that

526
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,000
is where space vehicles start hitting

527
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,600
each other and create more debris and

528
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,039
more debris

529
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,200
you know lacking of testing because it's

530
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,440
too expensive a launch vibration can

531
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,919
destroy your vehicle as well as launch

532
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,200
explosions

533
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,480
that happens a lot

534
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,280
uh you know sometimes your solar panels

535
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,600
fail to deploy sometimes you

536
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,200
your spacecraft just tumbles you can't

537
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,320
get control of it power do you orbit

538
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,240
there's also the anomaly

539
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,919
this is something i learned very

540
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,320
recently there is an anomaly on earth uh

541
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,640
and where i should say above earth where

542
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,520
um there's a place above uh south

543
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,799
america

544
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,799
uh this area right here

545
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,120
uh where spacecraft tend to die it's

546
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,440
called the south atlantic anomaly uh

547
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,840
basically a bunch of electromagnetic

548
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,200
interference

549
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,559
kind of streams in that area and it

550
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,320
kills spacecraft

551
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,160
sort of like the bermuda triangle and

552
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,640
it's absolutely real

553
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,520
so

554
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,520
how about how do we do cyber security in

555
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,200
space and this is what we're really

556
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,440
after how do we secure our stuff so

557
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,520
unlike ground computers you know cyber

558
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,440
attacks you know are not the primary

559
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,160
threat to operation so you know like

560
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,960
like an aws server it's going to be up

561
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,559
pretty much all the time you can kind of

562
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:55,840
assume that

563
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,160
unless a hacker takes it down

564
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,720
but in a space vehicle you know it's

565
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,720
just going to get attacked by meteorites

566
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,400
and you know things are going to fail

567
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,919
and you can't replace it and things are

568
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,840
going to die and you need ways to get

569
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,520
access to the system so it's not like

570
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,240
you can prioritize cyber security above

571
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,159
everything else

572
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,200
and also

573
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,880
anti-malware software

574
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,039
um and other defenses we would use on

575
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,640
the ground are just impractical i mean

576
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,159
not only because of the architectural

577
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,559
difference but because there's you know

578
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,120
hard power and resource usage limits a

579
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,039
lot of these um

580
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,480
a lot of these spacecrafts are just

581
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,919
working on trickles of power and you

582
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,760
don't really want that power running you

583
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,559
know

584
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,960
anti-malware software when you need to

585
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,520
get data back to the ground

586
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,039
so you really need

587
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,559
your spacecraft to be designed to be

588
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,960
robust and have everything isolated from

589
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,880
each other um

590
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,120
so your your sensor should not be able

591
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,120
to affect your your ion drive and so

592
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,080
forth

593
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,880
and um many spacecraft and this is a

594
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,720
known fault and i'm going to tell you

595
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,880
like this is how you hack into stuff in

596
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,720
space all spacecraft have this fault um

597
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,080
if you want to get past the encryption

598
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,720
on all spacecraft

599
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,320
make sure that the spacecraft or space

600
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,760
vehicle cannot communicate with the

601
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,960
ground

602
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,640
in that case the space vehicle will

603
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,760
assume there's something wrong with the

604
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,520
encryption and fall back to an

605
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,280
unencrypted mode

606
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,320
this

607
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,000
works on

608
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,440
any space based satellite regardless of

609
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,280
country this is a known flaw and this is

610
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,559
nothing new

611
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,640
um but this is the state of cyber

612
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,640
security in space right now

613
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,400
so what can a threat actor do

614
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,320
with a spacecraft

615
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,840
this is my favorite attack they can tell

616
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,320
the the payload to use all the power so

617
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,840
essentially they set up a startup

618
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,760
routine where they're like take all the

619
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,480
pictures take um you know take every

620
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,880
setting you know start running the the

621
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,400
drill or whatever is on the space

622
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,520
vehicle

623
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,440
and then so the space vehicle starts up

624
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,360
starts using all the equipment and then

625
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,440
it drains all the power shuts down and

626
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,120
then it starts up again and starts using

627
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,880
all the equipment runs out of power

628
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,240
shuts down

629
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,870
denial of service

630
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,000
[Music]

631
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,320
and that that's kind of the common um

632
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,720
attack that we've seen so far you can

633
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,000
compromise the

634
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,600
software defined radio and change the

635
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,039
frequencies

636
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,200
uh you can interfere with the navigation

637
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,120
uh on the space vehicle or mess up the

638
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,600
thrust um you can previously permanently

639
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,159
disable communications if you somehow

640
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,440
mess up the the circuit to the software

641
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,400
defined radio

642
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,960
you can permanently disable ground cons

643
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,880
or you can just jam the communications

644
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,919
um

645
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,440
you know and of course cyber security

646
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,799
begins on the ground someone can

647
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,720
interfere or steal with the design you

648
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,440
know a supply chain attack

649
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,440
uh you can poison the test data so you

650
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,039
think your spacecraft is going to do

651
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,200
well when it's not um you can

652
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,200
take over a ground station and suddenly

653
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,919
get control of the spacecraft

654
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,919
and you can take over you know

655
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,400
third-party consumer data install

656
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,240
malware in the bootloader of the machine

657
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,159
there's lots of stuff you can do

658
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,559
to a space vehicle if you get access to

659
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:01,919
it

660
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,600
so but what can you do to defend the

661
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,039
space vehicle

662
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,799
knowing that knowing that all these

663
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,120
things all these bad things can happen

664
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,880
then one of the most important things is

665
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,600
to have watchdog scripts and programs

666
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,440
so you really want to have sanity checks

667
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,799
you want to make sure that everything is

668
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,520
behaving as expected

669
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,280
if something is going wrong

670
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,880
you want your space vehicle to go into

671
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,760
like some sort of safety mode or or

672
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,360
you know require

673
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,799
you know some

674
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,440
command from the ground to continue

675
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,480
um

676
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,799
you also want gold copies aboard if

677
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,679
something goes wrong with an update if a

678
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,440
bad actor installs malware on the

679
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,200
machine you want to be able to

680
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,279
to fall back to a good version of the

681
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,799
software

682
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,440
you want fallback encryption

683
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,480
so that

684
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,760
if something goes on wrong with the

685
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,600
encryption like see you

686
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,400
like the attackers upload a new key you

687
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,919
want to be able to fall back to an

688
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,840
encryption that's not entirely

689
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,919
unencrypted but you have you know the

690
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,240
keys that you can use with it

691
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,000
you want of course resource you want to

692
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,919
limit the amount of resources that your

693
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,400
system can use at any given time

694
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,480
uh so if if you realize that you're

695
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,480
going to run out of battery power soon

696
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,520
just you know have the have the systems

697
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,520
turn off the

698
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,919
the cameras have it turn off the

699
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,279
you know the

700
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,440
the lasers or whatever is on there

701
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,000
lasers in space by the way is awesome um

702
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,360
and you want to of course isolate all

703
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,120
devices and resources from each other

704
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,360
because if a an attacker gets access to

705
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,880
the

706
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,600
uh to the computer on board on board the

707
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,200
camera you don't want them getting

708
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,520
access to the thrusters or even the

709
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,799
other

710
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:41,760
um

711
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,679
the other systems for doing scientific

712
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,320
research

713
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,440
so let's hack some satellites everyone

714
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,600
how hard could this be um and so

715
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,720
remember i mentioned we're going to talk

716
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,520
a lot about software-defined radios

717
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,480
well um yeah that's basically the main

718
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,240
thing you need to hex headlights

719
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,880
nowadays is a 20 software defined radio

720
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,559
dongle it looks like this

721
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,360
and you can use that to essentially get

722
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,840
into a lot of of satellites or at least

723
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,440
download their data and and start

724
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,279
playing around with them and by the way

725
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,440
do do play around with them space is for

726
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,480
everybody

727
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,039
uh including you know the satellites uh

728
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,360
that's put up there by the governments

729
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,360
a lot of them are not encrypted like

730
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,520
they do not encrypt the data coming down

731
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,760
specifically for you to play with i mean

732
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,320
i really want to encourage everyone

733
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,840
to spread out their space legs

734
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,400
okay so let's talk a little bit about

735
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,120
radio waves and light polarization

736
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,480
because that's going to be a big thing

737
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,640
when you are trying to receive data from

738
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,080
satellites

739
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,720
so uh many of you may know of you know

740
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,880
polarized sunglasses or or maybe you

741
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,279
worked with lcd systems uh

742
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,880
like the displays and you know a little

743
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,760
bit about you know horizontal and

744
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,640
and vertical light polarization

745
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,480
um and

746
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,000
of course that applies to radio waves as

747
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,840
well because radio waves are light

748
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,600
and so if you have for example if you

749
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,600
look at professionally installed tv

750
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,159
antennas you'll notice that all the

751
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,200
arrays here are horizontal to the ground

752
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,520
and that's because traditionally

753
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,960
tv signals

754
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,960
are sent using horizontal

755
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,960
polarization and so when you are

756
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,039
receiving a signal

757
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,760
either on the ground or from space

758
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,000
you want to make sure that your

759
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,039
antenna system has the same polarization

760
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,240
now of course the problem though is that

761
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,919
you know horizontal and vertical make a

762
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,400
lot of sense on the on the ground

763
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,840
it does not make a whole lot of sense in

764
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,919
space where it's very hard to define you

765
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,080
know vertical and horizontal so a lot of

766
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,480
spacecraft instead use

767
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,960
circular polarization which basically

768
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,520
means that the light either kind of goes

769
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,440
in a left-handed corkscrew or a

770
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,679
right-handed corkscrew

771
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,760
and so in order to to receive these

772
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,360
signals oftentimes you'll have to make

773
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,600
something like this and this is what i

774
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,039
made

775
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,240
it's a

776
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,600
high a quadruple quadraphile

777
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,760
um

778
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,679
quadriphal coidal

779
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,679
um basically it's a bunch of um

780
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,200
a bunch of wires that are kind of going

781
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,559
around in a

782
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,960
you know in you know around and around

783
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,399
and around kind of

784
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,039
the base um around the center pole like

785
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,840
that and it will receive circularized

786
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,559
uh polarized signals uh from

787
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,360
uh weather satellites

788
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,639
that'll be clear

789
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,320
clear all drawings okay

790
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,960
um so what can we do um

791
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,799
what can we do let's let's

792
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,559
let's start let's start grabbing data

793
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,039
from from satellites

794
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,520
so when people start i always say start

795
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,200
with noaa 15

796
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,559
noaa 18

797
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,399
and noah 19.

798
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:07,440
those three satellites pass overhead

799
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,000
usually one of them or two of them are

800
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,320
gonna pass like once or twice a week so

801
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,840
you go online

802
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,480
um and i'll show how to do this later i

803
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,159
had to go online and do this but um

804
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:21,520
uh you can figure out when they're

805
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,120
passing overhead

806
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,799
and and wait outside for their signal

807
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,240
um and oh yeah here's the quadra

808
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,960
quadrophilial helicoidal calculator that

809
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,159
i used to design the antenna

810
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,760
um and how to wire it um

811
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,640
how i made the uh wiring all right um

812
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,320
anyway uh actually back back to the

813
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,000
target uh right so we're gonna get those

814
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,440
we're going to um

815
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,039
attack 137.1 to 137.9 megahertz so

816
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,360
that's about 137.5

817
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,279
so right so we're designing our antenna

818
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,640
around that

819
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,559
um

820
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,240
and um

821
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,320
let's let's before we

822
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,000
actually grab those signals let's talk a

823
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,320
little bit about

824
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,080
how data is transferred over radio waves

825
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,159
so you may have heard about am radio in

826
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,440
fact i'm almost certain you've heard

827
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,240
that term am radio or amplitude

828
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,720
modulation what does that mean

829
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,880
well in when you send out a wave let's

830
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,399
say i don't know

831
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,240
100 kilohertz

832
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,919
it goes up and down and you can encode

833
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,000
data based on how

834
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,399
quote unquote loudly or how brightly the

835
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,080
signal is coming out

836
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,200
because we're talking about light right

837
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,120
so if you make it really dim and then

838
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,880
bright again and then dim and then

839
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,960
bright you can encode you know binary

840
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,039
data um and that's called amplitude

841
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,799
modulation

842
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:50,399
uh frequency modulation is one that you

843
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,559
likely have heard heard about again um

844
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,440
it's more common than am at

845
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,880
in a lot of ways

846
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,559
uh and basically what it what it does is

847
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:01,039
that instead of encoding basic based on

848
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,080
how loud or how bright the signal is

849
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,440
uh it

850
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,679
encodes the data based on

851
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,760
frequency shifting so if if you can

852
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,440
imagine if you wanted like a one or a

853
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,399
zero

854
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,799
you could shift the frequency between

855
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,200
you know 100 kilohertz and 102 kilohertz

856
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,640
or something and you can switch between

857
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,880
them to send data

858
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,279
and that's called frequency modulation

859
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,600
um and there's another one

860
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,600
that's a little less known but super

861
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,360
important whenever you're working with

862
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,000
binary data working with computers

863
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,240
phase modulation is going to prop up

864
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,600
somewhere

865
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,559
and basically what phase modulation uh

866
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,480
does is it encodes data based on the

867
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,200
phase of the waste waves so if you know

868
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,840
if you have a sine wave it goes up and

869
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,320
down and up and down and if you record

870
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,880
where that phase is over time you can

871
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,200
encode ones and zeros and actually this

872
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,240
is

873
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,640
always almost always i've never seen a

874
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,480
digital device that uses radio waves

875
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,720
that does not use phase modulation in

876
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,080
some way

877
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,519
so i know this is probably the hardest

878
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:06,640
one to understand but it is the most

879
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,640
important

880
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,200
um so when we're getting a noaa 15 18 19

881
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,600
we're actually receiving a um analog

882
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,880
signal so not digital and it uses

883
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,720
something called uh automatic picture

884
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,840
transmission

885
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,799
which is a

886
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,200
if you've heard of like slow scan tv

887
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,440
where you have an audio signal contain

888
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,240
or yeah an audio signal contain visual

889
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,000
data that's exactly what's going on you

890
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,159
have a regular fm

891
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:39,120
data signal or sorry an fm audio signal

892
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,039
containing an analog image that you can

893
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,200
decode

894
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,679
uh so you take out your your antenna you

895
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:46,559
you

896
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:49,440
take out your 20 antenna yeah sorry you

897
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,320
take out your 20 uh sdr dongle

898
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,000
you go to

899
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,919
um the hardware store

900
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,679
you make a qfh

901
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:58,720
like this

902
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,159
you make one of those and that's going

903
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:02,480
to cost you i don't know 50 bucks at

904
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,159
most probably less

905
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,480
probably can do it even if you scrap it

906
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,440
um

907
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,679
maybe you can do it for like another 20

908
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,039
go outside

909
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,679
just record one you know the frequency

910
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,559
of the noaa satellite passing overhead

911
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,480
and you'll hear it it sounds like tick

912
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,799
tick tick tick

913
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,000
and

914
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,760
you can then decode an image and this is

915
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,640
an actual image that i decoded overhead

916
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,080
um it's always gonna be in black and

917
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,200
white

918
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,640
um and the image quality isn't that

919
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,240
great but

920
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,080
you are interacting with a space

921
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,399
satellite going overhead you're tracking

922
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,159
it you're grabbing the data

923
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,480
you're you know decoding the data and

924
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,640
you're all doing this with

925
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,240
hardware that is dirt cheap you're going

926
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,039
to the hardware store you're using a 20

927
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,960
dongle usb dongle and you're interacting

928
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,880
with stuff in space i mean how cool is

929
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,720
that

930
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,399
um

931
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:57,279
and oh by the way uh before i forget um

932
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,200
i'm not going into the the details of

933
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,240
what software to decode because um

934
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,919
there's a

935
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:06,720
uh let me uh stop sharing here i'm gonna

936
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,240
switch sharing to my browser

937
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,120
ah here we go

938
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,200
um and i'll link this into the chat here

939
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,760
if you go to uh sam's class dot info by

940
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,679
the way sam bound is my

941
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:20,640
uh

942
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,480
i'm sandbound protege he's my mentor so

943
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,320
we work together on a lot of the stuff

944
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,240
but there's a bunch of projects here

945
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,360
about

946
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,880
you know how to do this stuff and so

947
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,799
what the first project here is about

948
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,600
decoding automatic picture transmission

949
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,320
signals and if you click this link you

950
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,720
go to sam's class dot info port slash

951
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,080
space

952
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,200
uh you can practice uh decoding

953
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,760
apt signals so you can download an apt

954
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,720
signal

955
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,519
uh and decode it and you know find find

956
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:54,559
a ctf flag

957
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,480
um

958
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,799
and that and like i said that you'll

959
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,799
that this goes over the software use i

960
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,960
personally use uh this

961
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,159
uh

962
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,799
noaa apt um

963
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,159
software

964
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,599
um but there's there's other software

965
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,440
you can use to decode it

966
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,040
anyway stop sharing i'm gonna go back to

967
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,480
the slides

968
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,040
uh share screen

969
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,159
slides

970
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,399
all right

971
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:21,599
um

972
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:22,320
so

973
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,199
yeah

974
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,879
now we we've gotten started okay uh i

975
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:27,119
did a wonderful yes yes uh someone

976
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,119
mentioned they did a workshop with sam

977
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,679
sam is absolutely fantastic

978
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,199
i love him to pieces he's a great great

979
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,480
great person

980
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,839
anyway so

981
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,399
uh so we used an sdr software to find

982
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:41,440
radio

983
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,079
to get a satellite signal how does a

984
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:46,000
software defined radio work because this

985
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,359
is something that confused me a lot when

986
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:48,879
i started working with software-defined

987
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,560
radios

988
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,119
um so when you work with uh when you

989
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:55,679
open something like sdr sharp which is a

990
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,079
a very popular software-defined radio uh

991
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,320
receiver program

992
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,880
uh you'll get something you'll record

993
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,520
something called iq data and what is iq

994
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,520
data what's going on

995
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,960
well it turns out that if you're trying

996
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,400
to for example

997
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,320
grab

998
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,160
137.5 megahertz signal

999
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,320
over usb directly that's not going to

1000
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,040
work usb does not operate that fast you

1001
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,400
cannot just pump 135

1002
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,440
megahertz signal through a usb cable um

1003
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,280
that's not going to work uh so what you

1004
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,720
have to do is you have to sort of down

1005
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,560
convert it

1006
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,320
and the way you do that

1007
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,960
is you

1008
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,880
multiply

1009
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,480
let me let me explain what these symbols

1010
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,800
mean you multiply

1011
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,760
the

1012
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,400
incoming signal this is multiply

1013
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,400
you in you multiply the signal coming in

1014
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,320
from the antenna

1015
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,960
uh with a sine wave or a cosine

1016
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,839
and what you get is

1017
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:54,720
uh

1018
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,440
a frequency that is both lower

1019
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,839
than the input and a frequency that's

1020
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:02,320
higher than the input

1021
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,839
now all we care about is the frequency

1022
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,240
that's lower than the input

1023
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,280
so we use a low pass filter

1024
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,119
to get rid of all the high

1025
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,280
frequency stuff that we don't want

1026
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,640
and so that way we can turn a high

1027
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,480
frequency signal into a low frequency

1028
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,599
signal and so if you are grabbing a 100

1029
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,680
megahertz signal

1030
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,839
and you multiply it with a

1031
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:27,760
99 megahertz signal

1032
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,160
sorry 99 megahertz sine wave you will

1033
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,880
get a one you can get a one megahertz

1034
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,400
signal out

1035
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,640
uh unfortunately this is kind of lossy

1036
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,400
um

1037
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,359
and

1038
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,040
uh

1039
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:41,760
so

1040
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,680
people who are much smarter than me

1041
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,800
came up with the idea of iq which means

1042
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,200
in phase and quadrature basically what

1043
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,440
you do is you take the input of the

1044
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,640
antenna

1045
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,599
and you

1046
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,440
take it through the amplifier and then

1047
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,560
it splits

1048
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,480
you go through a cosine

1049
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,920
for the in phase

1050
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,200
and a sine wave for the quadrature and

1051
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,560
you do the same thing again low pass

1052
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,520
filter

1053
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,839
analog to digital converter you get the

1054
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:10,640
in phase once again low pass filter

1055
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,240
and like the digital converter you get

1056
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,920
the quadrature and that's where the iq

1057
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,760
comes from and when you combine these

1058
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,760
two signals together you can recreate

1059
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,400
the original high frequency

1060
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,880
wave using something that's almost

1061
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,560
comparable to like

1062
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,720
sound audio frequencies

1063
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,960
and this is how all your digital devices

1064
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,880
work your wi-fi uh your 20 sdr they are

1065
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,520
all doing this iq transformation

1066
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,480
so that's what you're doing when you're

1067
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,119
recording on a sdr program and you see

1068
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,839
this like record iq that's what's going

1069
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:43,920
on that's why you're not just recording

1070
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,320
a straight you know 200 megahertz sine

1071
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,119
wave

1072
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,520
uh or 200 megahertz input you're doing

1073
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,640
all these calculations first to down to

1074
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,160
down convert the signal to something

1075
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,680
that can pass through a usb cable

1076
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,040
let's clear the markings again

1077
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,520
it's all right so in phase quadrature

1078
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,720
just means 90 degrees

1079
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:10,240
of phase difference

1080
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,720
okay so let's talk about um

1081
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,320
encoding digital data using this

1082
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,240
remember when i said pm

1083
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,200
like super important for digital data

1084
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,839
uh well you can plot iq in like a 2d

1085
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:26,880
graph um let me once again pull up my

1086
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,079
drawing

1087
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:31,359
so you can plot it like this so you have

1088
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,119
q vertical

1089
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,920
and i horizontal

1090
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,839
and so when you receive a signal you can

1091
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:39,359
start plotting

1092
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:42,000
what you're getting on this sort of iq

1093
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,640
circularly doodad right so if you have a

1094
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,040
queue of

1095
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,880
0.45 and an i of 0.45 it goes here if

1096
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,560
you have a

1097
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,640
i of negative

1098
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,839
0.45 and a q of 0.5 you get something up

1099
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:01,280
here and so you can sort of plot around

1100
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,800
these you can plot the points that

1101
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,920
you're receiving on this

1102
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,920
on the circle and it really represents

1103
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,000
the phase that you're in and so we can

1104
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,560
use this to encode digital data using

1105
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,079
phase modulation very simply

1106
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,520
let me clear the drawings again

1107
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,599
all right so how does this work so let's

1108
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:23,839
say you receive a signal and it's in the

1109
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:26,240
top right corner you might decode that

1110
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,680
as 1 1 if it's in the bottom left

1111
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,320
two zeros so on and so forth

1112
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,000
and this is called actually quadrature

1113
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,200
phase shift key ring qpsk that is very

1114
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,640
popular when

1115
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,560
encoding digital data your wi-fi uses

1116
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,760
this often and of course your satellites

1117
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,599
use this as well

1118
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:46,800
as well as

1119
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,960
a simpler version called bpsk which is

1120
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,320
by

1121
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,079
phase shift key

1122
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,960
key ringing which which is just

1123
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,560
two sides you just go back and forth

1124
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,599
between both sides but yeah qpsk very

1125
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,359
popular um and that's how you encode a

1126
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,839
lot of digital data

1127
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:04,800
let me

1128
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,480
clear drawings again all right

1129
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,720
and you can actually you can view uh

1130
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,839
qpsk data in sdr sharp uh which is once

1131
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:16,480
again a popular program for this for

1132
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,200
grabbing sdr data from your sdr dongle

1133
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,880
you'll see it down here in the bottom

1134
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,280
left-hand corner using something called

1135
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,680
meteor demodulator and we're going to

1136
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,280
talk about the meteor satellites in a

1137
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,079
second because they do use qpsk and you

1138
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:32,800
can see the demodulation down below here

1139
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,440
and you can see how the points are kind

1140
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,280
of coming up in these quadrants very

1141
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,240
uh

1142
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,240
particularly in these quadrants

1143
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,479
um

1144
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,000
clear out drawings again

1145
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,079
so now that we have the tools and

1146
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,960
understanding of collecting uh digital

1147
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,440
data we can use it to start decoding

1148
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,240
digital transmissions which

1149
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,240
are is like you know all or nothing uh

1150
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,160
so here's an example of one i did once

1151
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,079
again overhead i live in california as

1152
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,480
you can as you can tell you know here's

1153
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,200
the here's the coastline of california

1154
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,839
uh when it is exactly overhead uh the

1155
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:14,480
quadrophilia antenna doesn't work too

1156
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,480
well which is why there's a big gap here

1157
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,520
but you do get color images of sorts

1158
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,760
uh when you're using

1159
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,000
um digital uh

1160
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,280
reception

1161
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,520
um but you know you also get higher res

1162
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,960
images

1163
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,599
and once again um decoding these is is

1164
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:32,800
all on the

1165
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,880
the specifics of how to decode this are

1166
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,079
is in the

1167
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,319
uh website the sam's class dot info for

1168
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:40,960
that space

1169
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:46,000
um and so let's talk a bit more about um

1170
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,960
since we're on the topic about amp about

1171
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,040
qpsk and uh

1172
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,160
qam

1173
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,760
all right so normally satellites are

1174
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,760
going to be using like i said the qpsk

1175
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,599
or or um or or just back and forth type

1176
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:02,240
modulation the bpsk

1177
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,200
because

1178
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,560
there's a lot of interference they're

1179
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,800
far away stuff can go wrong

1180
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,280
however your wi-fi

1181
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,440
is usually much closer

1182
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,040
and so you can add amplitude modulation

1183
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,400
to your phase modulation and you get uh

1184
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,240
something called quadrature amplitude

1185
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,520
modulation

1186
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,319
in which case you what you do is is you

1187
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:26,000
look at your phase which is going to be

1188
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,839
somewhere like let's say it's in the

1189
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:29,839
let's say we get a signal that is i'm

1190
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:32,560
going to change my color here that is um

1191
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:36,319
in this quadrant down here

1192
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:40,400
now if we have a strong signal coming in

1193
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,440
it's

1194
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,599
going to go all the way out to here

1195
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:45,359
all the way out to the end if it's a

1196
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:46,720
weak signal

1197
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,400
meaning we're doing some amplitude

1198
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,920
modulation

1199
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,720
it will only go out to here

1200
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,280
so now in a single quadrant

1201
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,599
we can start start encoding four bits at

1202
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:00,000
a time or sorry four

1203
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,480
four different types of

1204
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,000
you know

1205
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,520
nibbles i should say

1206
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,960
um

1207
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,800
so you can start encoding much more data

1208
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,839
per

1209
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:11,920
uh per wave and but of course this just

1210
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,599
requires a lot

1211
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:16,880
closer of a or a lot clearer of a signal

1212
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,560
and this is why when you get wi-fi for

1213
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,599
example

1214
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:21,280
if you're far away

1215
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,119
from the from your router your speeds

1216
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:25,040
will slow down because it will convert

1217
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,119
from something like qam

1218
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:30,880
to something like q psk to bpsk and so

1219
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,920
forth

1220
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,800
to try to get the data through um

1221
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,400
but yeah if you get a clear signal you

1222
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,800
can start encoding more and more data

1223
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,839
into your signal

1224
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,359
they're all drawings again all right

1225
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:48,000
um so yeah so

1226
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,359
all right so we're looking at low earth

1227
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:51,040
orbit satellites

1228
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,839
uh qam oh someone writes qam also is

1229
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,680
what cable modems use yes

1230
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,000
yes so like i said anytime you're using

1231
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,440
digital devices

1232
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,359
you're going to come up with these

1233
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:03,599
these terms you know

1234
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,240
phase modulation qam etc

1235
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,040
so goes is another good place to start

1236
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,520
and so once once you've done the apt you

1237
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,119
know automatic picture transmission on

1238
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:14,960
the noaa satellites once you've done

1239
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,000
meteor

1240
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,560
you can start going off

1241
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,160
and start looking at geostationary

1242
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,400
satellites and these are awesome

1243
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,560
because remember what i said if a

1244
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,560
geostationary satellite orbits once

1245
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,359
every 24 hours so it always looks like

1246
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:31,760
they're in the same place in the sky so

1247
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,040
after a while you're gonna get kind of

1248
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,119
bored of planning out your days when you

1249
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,440
know noah is going to pass overhead

1250
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,240
when you start going to the

1251
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,319
geostationary satellites

1252
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,319
uh what you need to do is just point

1253
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:45,359
there at any time you want and grab data

1254
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:47,200
and you're going to need

1255
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,119
unfortunately a beefier antenna you're

1256
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:51,760
gonna need a dish um a lot of people use

1257
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,280
these little wi-fi dishes and that's

1258
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,960
what i did i modified a 2.4 gigahertz

1259
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,480
wi-fi disk to connect at 1.7 gigahertz

1260
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,839
which is what the goes satellites

1261
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:04,400
uses

1262
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,880
uh but you get these full disk images

1263
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,560
from geostationary orbit and they are

1264
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,920
absolutely fantastic and you can get

1265
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,920
them anytime you want

1266
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,200
anytime they always look like they're in

1267
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,640
the same place in the sky like i said

1268
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,400
um and um

1269
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,720
of course you know taking pictures in

1270
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,079
space is fun

1271
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:25,839
um but we can get into a lot more

1272
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:27,520
trouble

1273
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,319
there's something called iridium

1274
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:32,319
the iridium satellite network uh iridium

1275
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:34,960
was put up in the 90s

1276
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,400
uh and it was a uh

1277
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,640
it's a satellite phone network uh so if

1278
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,800
you're on a boat and you need phone

1279
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,359
communication texting anywhere

1280
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:47,040
you know cell phone won't do you you go

1281
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,040
you get an iridium phone

1282
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,960
so this was put up in the 90s

1283
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,280
and their idea of cyber security back

1284
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,800
then was uh it is so complicated and so

1285
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,839
advanced no hacker will ever be able to

1286
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:01,839
defeat the system

1287
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:04,720
and uh it turns out of course it is now

1288
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,160
2021

1289
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,760
you can go to the store

1290
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,400
buy a 20 sdr dongle

1291
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,280
a 5 gps antenna

1292
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,520
which works on a similar frequency to

1293
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,640
iridium

1294
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,319
and you can start intercepting people's

1295
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:21,200
phone calls uh these are all unencrypted

1296
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,079
um

1297
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:23,599
i'm not gonna go into the details of how

1298
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:25,280
to do this

1299
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,160
but

1300
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,839
it is possible and if you are interested

1301
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,200
i would definitely check it out um

1302
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:33,200
iridium uh the iridium satellite network

1303
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,280
um and uh

1304
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,280
yeah so to finish yeah we're getting

1305
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,960
close to ending so i do want to talk a

1306
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,359
little bit about the deep space network

1307
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:43,520
um so on earth of course we have the

1308
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,720
internet

1309
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,400
and in space we have the deep space

1310
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,960
network which consists of three sites on

1311
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,160
earth that are 120 degrees apart

1312
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,560
that look out all across

1313
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,119
you know the solar system and beyond uh

1314
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,680
to grab deep space data

1315
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,440
uh including like for example the space

1316
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,200
landing

1317
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,400
all right sorry the moon landing just

1318
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,160
based on the moon landing

1319
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,200
um

1320
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,560
and the way it works is it uses

1321
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,480
something called delay or disruption

1322
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,079
tolerant networking which means that um

1323
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:16,240
it's sort of like another version of tcp

1324
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,240
ip it's it's that kind of layer type

1325
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,119
stuff but it um

1326
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:23,359
it basically means that if there's if

1327
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:25,119
you can't get the data down like

1328
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:26,640
something in between will hold on to the

1329
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,559
data and then send it back and you have

1330
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:30,000
these giant networks of things around

1331
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,240
mars and earth and stuff and you can

1332
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:35,119
actually set up a dtn network at home

1333
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:38,000
and once again sam's class dot info for

1334
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,839
space

1335
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:41,359
um and you can actually you can

1336
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,680
absolutely start grabbing stuff up off

1337
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,599
the deep space network at home uh

1338
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:48,000
there's a link here for uhf satcom

1339
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,200
with a bunch of information about that

1340
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,640
um

1341
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,040
uh if you are looking to get into uh

1342
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,559
space engineering

1343
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:59,359
looking at how to attack you know space

1344
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:00,559
vehicles

1345
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:02,800
knowing how to program fpgas is very

1346
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,079
important

1347
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:06,240
uh because a lot of space vehicles use

1348
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:09,280
custom hardware and things like the sdrs

1349
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,079
are often connected to fpgas to perform

1350
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:13,599
the encryption

1351
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,960
um so definitely definitely learn learn

1352
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,559
some fpga

1353
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:19,520
um

1354
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,680
you know verilog type

1355
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,839
or vhdl uh programming if you're

1356
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:27,520
interested in getting into space hacking

1357
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,480
um oh operating systems in space

1358
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,640
so as you may have guessed we do not run

1359
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,680
windows or linux usually um with rare

1360
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,240
exception on our spacecraft uh usually

1361
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,160
we run something called a real-time

1362
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,920
operating system

1363
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:42,880
um

1364
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,599
that's and usually it's wind river vx

1365
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:46,720
works

1366
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,720
is the operating system you'll find on

1367
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,400
spacecraft now getting this operating

1368
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,640
system is really hard

1369
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,200
um so i would recommend if you want to

1370
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,960
get into real-time operating systems

1371
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,160
check out uh free rtos

1372
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,839
it's free open source you can download

1373
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:03,119
it you can actually run it on top of

1374
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:04,640
windows

1375
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:05,599
um

1376
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:07,680
as far as other open source software you

1377
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,960
can check out

1378
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,720
uh there's the amex mission control

1379
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,240
which is the missing control software

1380
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,720
used at you know nasa

1381
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,440
as well as openmct once again mission

1382
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,319
control software hosted and developed by

1383
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:22,480
and used at nasa

1384
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,000
um

1385
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,440
and of course the core flight system

1386
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,359
which is the software that is put on all

1387
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:29,359
spacecraft uh if you want to get into

1388
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:30,720
space hacking

1389
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,680
go through this github repository

1390
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,280
learn the ins and outs of this all the

1391
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,800
soft all those spacecraft run the

1392
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,040
software pretty much

1393
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,880
um and yeah let's talk about some

1394
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,720
currents going on um right now i'm

1395
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,119
actually working on a azimuth

1396
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:47,599
elevation rotator um

1397
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:52,400
which was based on on this guy uh wb0oew

1398
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,960
by the way get a ham radio license

1399
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,280
if you are interested in

1400
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,400
in

1401
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,800
space hacking and radio hacking ham

1402
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,160
licenses are your best friend

1403
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:07,280
um anyway he developed a an azimuth

1404
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,720
elevation rotator which is important

1405
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:09,760
because when you're dealing with

1406
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,280
satellites

1407
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,640
that are moving overhead sometimes you

1408
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,000
have to track them

1409
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,160
they get ex they get expensive

1410
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,920
anyway so i'm working on that right now

1411
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,280
um the other big thing of course in

1412
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:22,079
hacking news is that the falcon 9 video

1413
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,880
from the rockets got

1414
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,000
um decoded i have much to spacex's to

1415
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,520
grin

1416
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,079
unfortunately as as this person points

1417
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:33,599
out all the signals are now being

1418
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:37,119
encrypted um but so fun's over but yeah

1419
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:38,720
tons of stuff to be done with space

1420
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,880
hacking

1421
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,040
and it's just it's just so fun and i

1422
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,640
just want to get everyone encouraged and

1423
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,680
get started and i i hope this helps

1424
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,879
anyway any questions

1425
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,200
arden writes i've been ruminating about

1426
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,359
getting a ham license one of these days

1427
00:50:57,359 --> 00:50:58,720
i will actually follow through yes

1428
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,960
absolutely um the thing about space

1429
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,640
hacking is that

1430
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:06,400
uh most uh space um vehicles and and

1431
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,640
stuff you'll be hacking work on vhf or

1432
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,800
uhf and

1433
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,800
uh so all you need is a technician's

1434
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,559
license to do pretty much all the space

1435
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:16,800
hacking you want and

1436
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,319
a lot of space vehicles are amateur and

1437
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:22,160
we'll actually encourage you to connect

1438
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:25,280
to using your you know uhf or your vhf

1439
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,559
ham radio equipment

1440
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,680
um

1441
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,760
what do you what do you suggest the best

1442
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,480
place to get an sdr um as much as i

1443
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:35,920
disagree with

1444
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,359
amazon's

1445
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:38,480
you know

1446
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,760
policies and their their

1447
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:45,520
business practices at times um i do have

1448
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,920
to recommend going on to amazon and i'll

1449
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,160
show you what i would recommend as a

1450
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,480
first

1451
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:57,359
as a first str so um

1452
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,640
you go to amazon

1453
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,280
see our

1454
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,400
blog

1455
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,240
uh v3 i think it is oh here it is uh get

1456
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,720
one of these um

1457
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,880
these for me have been some of the best

1458
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:13,760
um

1459
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,880
20 this is actually 27 and usually

1460
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,720
there's a bit yeah you can usually get

1461
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,599
these with antennas for that price but

1462
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:23,040
um

1463
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,200
this has been probably my favorite 20

1464
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,839
str i use this probably more than a lot

1465
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:31,599
of the 200 or 300 sdrs that i have

1466
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:33,440
uh in

1467
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,040
in canada

1468
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,040
uh so demise says in canada it's

1469
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,400
basically just your name that gets in a

1470
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,000
database you don't have to list your

1471
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,680
address that's it yeah so

1472
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,640
when you get a ham license um

1473
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,040
say goodbye to your privacy your your

1474
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,720
address gets put in a database and

1475
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:49,920
anyone who wants to know where you live

1476
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,599
can look you up

1477
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:52,400
um

1478
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,280
if i tell you my call sign yeah so in

1479
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,880
canada apparently they solved that but

1480
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,440
in america yeah if you get a ham license

1481
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,559
um

1482
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:02,160
yeah if you wanna know where i live uh

1483
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:05,839
it's 610 eastwood el drive apartment 454

1484
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:07,920
out of sunnyvale california

1485
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,079
um i can't hide that my

1486
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:11,680
you can just go on the fcc website and

1487
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,760
get that for you

1488
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:17,119
yes rtl sdrs are receive only um if you

1489
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:18,960
want to transmit uh you'll have to get

1490
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,440
something like a pluto sdr or or a hack

1491
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:22,640
rf

1492
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,880
those are significantly more expensive

1493
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,079
um

1494
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:27,520
and

1495
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,040
you know uh the best thing to do if

1496
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,880
you're trying to connect to

1497
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:31,760
uh

1498
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:32,880
a space

1499
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:37,440
uh something in space is to use a um

1500
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:42,240
something like a ht so a handy talkie um

1501
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,040
to

1502
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:46,558
essentially send out your signals

1503
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:48,480
uh arden says thank you for the awesome

1504
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,160
talk well thank you for having me i'm

1505
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,079
always happy to talk about space space

1506
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:55,520
is my passion hacking is my passion so

1507
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,200
um

1508
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,760
yes yes uh uls is wonderful thing when

1509
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,000
you're interested in privacy indeed

1510
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,319
um

1511
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,000
yeah so anyway i just wanna encourage

1512
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,440
you like i said your space is for

1513
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,640
everyone

1514
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,800
um if you're interested in getting into

1515
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,920
aerospace uh or doing space hacking it's

1516
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,480
really not as prohibitive as you might

1517
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:20,400
think uh 20 sdr 20 antenna

1518
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:24,400
go out there start receiving signals

1519
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,839
uh

1520
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:29,359
any thoughts on hakkasak sat yes um so

1521
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:31,920
hackasat is is absolutely awesome i've

1522
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,599
done all their challenges

1523
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:34,480
uh they are

1524
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,680
[Music]

1525
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,520
it's a lot of fun uh it's not

1526
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:38,960
necessarily the most like you know

1527
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,960
realistic challenges that that they put

1528
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,680
up uh but i'm definitely happy that that

1529
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,839
we're doing this like i said the state

1530
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:47,680
of cyber security in

1531
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,920
in space is abysmal

1532
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,280
you know we put up

1533
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,839
stuff in space in the 90s it's still up

1534
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:55,520
there we can't upgrade it we can't do

1535
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,240
anything about it you know you can

1536
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,240
listen to people's phone calls i mean

1537
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,680
it's so bad

1538
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:02,640
um

1539
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,079
and and you know no one was even

1540
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:05,520
thinking about cyber security at the

1541
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,440
time so i'm glad we're getting some

1542
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,720
attention and people are learning about

1543
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,680
this awesome subject

1544
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,160
um yeah and yeah so you can actually go

1545
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,000
and and look at all the presentations

1546
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,079
made for hackaths you can download the

1547
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:20,319
vms for hack sets

1548
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,319
uh you know do some of the challenges um

1549
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:23,839
in fact i'm really actually surprised

1550
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:25,920
that uh some of the challenges were kind

1551
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,640
of on the easy side and some of the the

1552
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,880
winners didn't do it maybe it was a time

1553
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,880
constraint thing i don't know but it

1554
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,480
just shows you that you know there's a

1555
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,880
lot of work to be done um

1556
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,200
in terms of getting people up to speed

1557
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,040
on you know on

1558
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,680
hacking in space but like i said

1559
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,119
uh

1560
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:47,200
a lot of stuff in space is intentionally

1561
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,760
unencrypted for you to use and for you

1562
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:52,559
to explore so please do it's there for

1563
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:54,000
you including the international space

1564
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,760
station if you didn't know this

1565
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,839
the international space station

1566
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:01,680
has amateur radios on board and you can

1567
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,280
contact them if you have an amateur

1568
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,760
radio set up you can contact them and

1569
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,200
you can bounce signals off the

1570
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,960
international space station at times to

1571
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,640
reach other people

1572
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:14,839
i mean it is super super awesome

1573
00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:17,119
so absolutely

1574
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:19,839
um i just checked the radio bad uh t pro

1575
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:21,599
bow thing yes

1576
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:24,000
yeah i mean i'm not i'm not a radio snob

1577
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,079
if if you can get a baofeng and and that

1578
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:28,480
works for you i mean all all the more

1579
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,960
power to you in fact the uv-5r

1580
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,319
valving

1581
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:34,799
is easily one of the most hackable

1582
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:35,680
um

1583
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,520
handy talkies there is

1584
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,119
uh if you want to turn that thing into

1585
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:42,240
like an aprs uh transceiver i mean

1586
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:45,839
you're you're good you're golden

1587
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:48,960
all right

1588
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:52,640
uh yeah five hours like yeah uv five r

1589
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:55,280
is only like 35 bucks as granby

1590
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,200
absolutely

1591
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,400
um

1592
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,640
yeah uv5r got a lot of people started

1593
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,559
yeah yeah absolutely i have i have

1594
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:05,280
nothing but but respect for for people

1595
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:08,480
that that start off with the uv5r i mean

1596
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,960
there are some radio snobs that you know

1597
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,280
it's like that's a 35 radio why aren't

1598
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,079
you buying a 2 000 radio or whatever

1599
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:18,000
well one not everyone has two thousand

1600
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,440
dollars to spare

1601
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,079
and and two i mean like

1602
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:24,640
it's awesome the ub5r is actually a good

1603
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,599
radio um now granted i should point out

1604
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:29,920
that the uv 5r apparently

1605
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,319
has some spurious transmissions that

1606
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:34,960
make it non-fcc compliant but

1607
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,280
i mean whatever and

1608
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,640
whatever gets you into radio whatever

1609
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:41,839
gets you into you know ham radio

1610
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:44,000
hacking and stuff it's all good by my

1611
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,240
book

1612
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:48,559
uh all right we're a few minutes okay so

1613
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:50,400
um anyway so we're a few minutes over so

1614
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,520
i'm gonna

1615
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,480
head out thank you for attending

1616
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:57,119
um enya hack all the planets not don't

1617
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:01,400
don't stop at earth hack them all
