2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,400
hello and welcome to enterprise security

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,480
i'm sorry enterprise security monitoring

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,320
with security engine my name is wes

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,719
lambert and i'm a principal engineer

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,119
with security engine solutions

7
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:18,960
at security engineering solutions we

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,400
help to develop maintain and implement

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,400
security for customers and i just wanted

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,599
to share

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,760
today how you can leverage from security

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,720
onion

13
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,320
or how you can leverage security and in

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,558
to get better visibility into your

15
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,200
network environments and uh you know

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,960
just increase that overall detection

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,600
coverage you have in your environment

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,600
so without further ado let's talk about

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,840
a little bit about what security ending

20
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,520
is right so

21
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,000
uh security in general is is it's a

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,760
distribution that's been around for

23
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,120
quite a while now um it's an open source

24
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,920
uh or free and open platform really for

25
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,760
uh threat hunting enterprise security

26
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,760
monitoring and log management

27
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,840
and what that means is you know you have

28
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,479
things like ids like uh cyricada or

29
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,280
snort um you know you're turning ids

30
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,040
alerts or you're reviewing those ids

31
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,119
alerts uh you're monitoring your

32
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,520
environment for signs of intrusion and

33
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,400
other suspicious activity and then

34
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,000
you know if you have other log sources

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,400
that you want to keep alongside that for

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,200
compliance purposes or for

37
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,360
other purposes you can absolutely do

38
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,280
that with security ending

39
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,600
so today is really just talking about

40
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,119
all the components that are within

41
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,280
security and how you can leverage those

42
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,439
to really uh help your detection

43
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,840
strategy and help your uh your bluetooth

44
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,520
right

45
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,799
so continue continuing on to what it is

46
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,560
uh you know there are lots of layers of

47
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,280
flavor within that security engine um we

48
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,360
have audit authentication logs maybe

49
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,960
that you might be pulling in from the

50
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,119
cloud or you may be performing traffic

51
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,399
mirroring in the cloud

52
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,799
there's a lot of capability there now

53
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,200
with things like uh environments like

54
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,399
gcp

55
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,840
and uh in aws uh azure not so much at

56
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,000
the moment but uh there's there's a lot

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,280
of good stuff there that can be brought

58
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,560
in from the cloud

59
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,440
into either your on-prem or in-cloud

60
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,280
security engine sensor

61
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,560
in addition to that you know server logs

62
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,959
application or maybe things like dns

63
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,599
login servers or dhcp logs

64
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,000
as well as windows logs and host logs

65
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,560
right sysmon logs we can bring those in

66
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,319
from uh

67
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,800
from servers and from hosts and then

68
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,560
bring those into security and then to

69
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,239
help you know from that detection and

70
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,239
that log management capability

71
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,840
perspective

72
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,000
in addition to you know really the most

73
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,519
popular i think

74
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,920
is uh the traffic mirroring that you

75
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,319
know we have coming in via spam port or

76
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,599
a tap

77
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,599
you can feed security engine with that

78
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,440
data and see

79
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,599
exactly what's going on on the wire

80
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,400
right so a lot of a lot of visibility

81
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,640
there and a lot of value there with

82
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,440
security in it

83
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,519
so why use it right so we can we can

84
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,040
collect all this data

85
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,280
um we have all these these ways or this

86
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,519
data that we can bring in um why would

87
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,200
we use security engine i talked a little

88
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,360
bit about you know detecting threats

89
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,800
right detecting threats within your

90
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,280
environment hunting for bad guys a lot

91
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,000
of times these ids rules that we have um

92
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,519
you know they're not going to be the

93
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,239
end-all be-all as far as figuring out

94
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,080
what's going on in your environment and

95
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,480
alerting on suspicious things or things

96
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,879
that should be alerted on

97
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,760
right

98
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,200
so uh

99
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,120
right now you know there's the ability

100
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,200
to do that there's ability to perform

101
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,840
network forensics uh collect and store

102
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,200
those logs that we mentioned from those

103
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,280
endpoints and then even really you know

104
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,400
troubleshooting

105
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,040
uh things within your network or uh you

106
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,720
know troubleshooting application

107
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,959
behaviors uh you know misbehaving

108
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,120
devices on your network there's been

109
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,760
tons and tons of times where uh you know

110
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,159
myself and other folks have identified

111
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,640
misbehaving applications or services and

112
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,239
been able to reach out and help other

113
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,400
folks to fix that just by using security

114
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,400
in it right so it's not always just

115
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,560
about detecting bad stuff but you know

116
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,480
there's a lot of overall visibility that

117
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,878
can be gained by using security

118
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,720
and one of the benefits uh i'll talk a

119
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,400
little bit so

120
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,120
in the 1604 we used to run a version of

121
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,560
security that was based on ubuntu 16.04

122
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,120
some of you may have run that before

123
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,720
we've really with this version of

124
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,240
security guarding that we now run on

125
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,520
centos 7 and ubuntu 1804

126
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,440
most of the services run in docker

127
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,000
containers and what that allows us to do

128
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,080
is really isolate those applications to

129
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,600
their own environment

130
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,199
uh you know their own requirements

131
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,720
isolated into

132
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,720
uh whatever os and other environment

133
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,120
specific uh things that need right into

134
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,720
that container

135
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,440
so

136
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,960
you know that's it's really useful from

137
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,120
that isolation or security perspective

138
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,199
but it's also useful for minimizing

139
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,680
those dependencies uh and that reliance

140
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,919
on the underlying poster that allows us

141
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,479
to be really flexible whenever we're

142
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,320
choosing to deploy security ending on a

143
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,479
platform right so

144
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,320
while we may only deploy it on ubuntu

145
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,560
1804 now and we

146
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,479
sent off seven now it gives us the

147
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,639
flexibility to not have to do as much

148
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,960
work if we want to move the platform to

149
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,198
another uh you know support distribution

150
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,919
so containerization uh is really

151
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,919
important as a really integral part of

152
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,080
this version of security ending uh you

153
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,000
may be you may see it referred to as

154
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,560
security nn2 in some instances which is

155
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,560
going to be that latest version uh and

156
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,240
then another instance is just security

157
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,320
engine since we have end of life the

158
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,639
other 1604 version of security i mean

159
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,039
now as as far as orchestration uh there

160
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,960
are some things behind the scenes that

161
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,440
we do with security and in to help

162
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,400
analysts and administrators uh

163
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,560
make administration of that box of that

164
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,800
security

165
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,560
installation easier

166
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,479
and some of that is

167
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,560
really most of it is through salt stack

168
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,919
or salt

169
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,240
um so if you're familiar with ansible or

170
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,680
a puppet or

171
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,360
configuration management systems like

172
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,160
that we use salt to manage the

173
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,840
configuration and the state of the

174
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,840
security in boxes so

175
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,000
uh you know you you want this box to be

176
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,720
in its desired state to be running a

177
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,319
certain set of services to be running a

178
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,759
certain configuration

179
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,280
and we use salt to to do that so

180
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,199
um you know there are many also like

181
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,199
downstream application configuration

182
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,280
files that we use salt in conjunction

183
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,680
with so for example uh you know

184
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,080
cerakotta's configuration file it may

185
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,880
have its own syntax even though it is um

186
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,840
you know

187
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,000
ids tools which is our rule management

188
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,240
um application it has its own kind of

189
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,319
config file in its format a certain way

190
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,400
an assault this allows us to abstract

191
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,720
that um to extract that data out of

192
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,680
those files and be able to manipulate it

193
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,599
at a higher level where we're not having

194
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,680
to go into those specific configuration

195
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,360
files and it makes it a lot easier from

196
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,199
the future perspective

197
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,960
to put a web interface in front of a lot

198
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,800
of those management tasks so you'll see

199
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,120
that as we go forward with security and

200
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,840
uh continuing on with this development

201
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,599
and then overall with that orchestration

202
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,199
we really get that increased resilience

203
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,599
and fault tolerance uh just again making

204
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,440
sure that those systems are in their

205
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,919
desired state or the state that we want

206
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,560
them to be in

207
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,759
and i want to talk a little bit about

208
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,080
grid monitoring along with

209
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,280
salt we have this capability to monitor

210
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,680
our security in the grid a lot of folks

211
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,840
like to put agents on their boxes you

212
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,039
know maybe they have different servers

213
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,319
they want to put like nagios or

214
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,400
something else on there um some other

215
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,520
tool

216
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,840
we leverage this in-house by default

217
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,360
with security i mean

218
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,479
grafana influx db and telegraph so

219
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,000
telegraph is going to be taking all

220
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,840
those metrics it's going to be ingesting

221
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,560
it into influx db and then grafana is

222
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,160
going to present that to us on a nice

223
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,080
little dashboard there

224
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,840
so it's it's a great way to be able to

225
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,680
go in from a web interface and really

226
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,759
see how all of your boxes in the grid

227
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,800
are doing

228
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,639
right you can see events per second

229
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,560
right are you above or below a certain

230
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,560
threshold for events per second

231
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,160
are you seeing the expected network

232
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,240
throughput that you expect to see

233
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,840
and maybe is there any packet loss or

234
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,599
what kind of data retention do you have

235
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,759
it's really useful for being able to

236
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,680
eyeball that quickly and get an idea of

237
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,919
that

238
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,880
so let's talk about the data a little

239
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,958
bit i mentioned the data a little bit

240
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,479
with those logs that we would

241
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,399
potentially be bringing into security in

242
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,560
it or that we could bring in

243
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,480
and one of those types of data is going

244
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,800
to be that of network data right data

245
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,880
that we're collecting off the network

246
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,800
that we're feeding to security i mean

247
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,760
via a span port or a tap

248
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,519
and this is really going to be comprised

249
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,959
um you know with

250
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,440
a bunch of different maybe subtypes or

251
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,200
types of data itself

252
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,399
it's going to be things like connection

253
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,040
data from surakata or zeek they both in

254
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,959
security and then we can log metadata

255
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,680
about those connections uh using circada

256
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,240
and zeek as well as session data so if

257
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,240
you've got things like http different

258
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,279
protocols ssl dns whatever

259
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,680
we log that data as well

260
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,080
and again both circada and z can do that

261
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,000
from the metadata perspective

262
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,080
so in this instance you know snort and

263
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,480
circada they're typically viewed as

264
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,720
a signature based ids where we're only

265
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,640
generating alerts for that traffic that

266
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,120
it seems in this instance circada can

267
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,360
also act as a metadata generation and

268
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,360
generate that network data and we can

269
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,959
review that later instead of just

270
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,600
generating alerts right it allows us for

271
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,440
a lot more context around the actual

272
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,360
alert and being able to see what's

273
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,519
actually going on

274
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,000
the same with extracted content data if

275
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,760
you have files that are traversing your

276
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,720
network

277
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,880
uh you know things like

278
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,320
executables

279
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,480
excel files word docs

280
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,040
you can configure security engines to

281
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,839
extract those via zeke or cerakata they

282
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,839
both can perform file extraction and we

283
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,000
can have that type of data to associate

284
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,720
to

285
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,839
or to look through during our

286
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,839
investigation uh full packet capture so

287
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,320
google's stunnographer we used to use

288
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,120
uh guinness uh netsniff ng

289
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,880
uh so we used to use netsuppg for the

290
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,640
full packet capture and we moved to

291
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,200
google stenographer to do that and what

292
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,000
we have now is a sort of indexed pcap

293
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,800
it's

294
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,120
faster to write and it's a little bit

295
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,519
more performant than uh than

296
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,399
smg has been in the past so um you know

297
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,920
it's a little bit different as far as

298
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,680
the files are being written on disk but

299
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,279
you still have that ability to review

300
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,680
that full pcap data

301
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,000
and then again we have our network data

302
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,079
down here below and the network packet

303
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,600
as you can see and we'll see different

304
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,880
types of data as we go along here

305
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,640
another type of data host data right so

306
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,880
host data is really important in fact uh

307
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,800
you know i mentioned network data some

308
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,959
people only use network data during

309
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,560
their investigations or only have that

310
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,560
capability some people only have host

311
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,240
data right some people only have

312
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,160
endpoint or agents installed on

313
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,720
endpoints um we can have both right i

314
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,880
mean why not but why not more

315
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,120
more context is always better

316
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,200
right so we can ingest certain types of

317
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,720
host data from

318
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,519
windows event logs system on data audit

319
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,640
d

320
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,399
tons of stuff right

321
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,880
uh elastic beats is one way that we do

322
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,000
it when log b and file b or two native

323
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,240
mechanisms that we support to be able to

324
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,920
tie them with all that stuff

325
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,240
um you know pick up those host logs and

326
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,720
send those off to security at him and

327
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,959
continue to build our contacts there

328
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,440
os query is another great one uh you

329
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,600
know not just for log collection but

330
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,240
also for querying the state

331
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,880
of the endpoint right so os query has

332
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,959
these you know these tables that you can

333
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,040
query certain status and certain details

334
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,279
about the host and you can do that in ad

335
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,880
hoc fashion from

336
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,560
fleet or fleet dm

337
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,480
and it's really a really super powerful

338
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,839
way to uh query across your endpoint at

339
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,760
a given point in time and also perform

340
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,680
differential queries against those

341
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,600
endpoints so we can collect all of that

342
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,880
data as well and prevent any security

343
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,120
and then we've supported osac and wazoo

344
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,279
for a long time you can still

345
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,839
bring in data windows event logs and

346
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,200
post logs and perform active response on

347
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,680
hosts with wazoo so that is available as

348
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,480
well

349
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,320
uh again you know there's there's more

350
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,240
than this that we can bring in uh these

351
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,639
are just a few examples but uh this

352
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,240
should hopefully give you an idea of the

353
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,560
power behind that and how you can easily

354
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,279
pull that data in

355
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,560
and then we also have file data right so

356
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,399
we have file oriented detection with

357
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,440
stroka

358
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,680
and if you're not familiar with stroka i

359
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,279
failed it looks like to include a link

360
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,720
here but um target stroke was a project

361
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,680
of targets and still is uh josh liberty

362
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,360
first started working on struck a few

363
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,120
years back and we've integrated it with

364
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,959
security and incense

365
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,839
but stroka is a great way to take those

366
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,399
files that extracted content data that

367
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,240
we've extracted from the network streams

368
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,600
from circada or zeek and then perform a

369
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,079
you know an analysis on that preliminary

370
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,720
analysis you know we can do things

371
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,760
it has various tons of scanners

372
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,160
you know you can see things like imports

373
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,639
or you can generate import hash right in

374
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,600
patch

375
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,600
see entropy

376
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,600
you can see all the sections right

377
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,680
exit data all sorts of things that you

378
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,360
can see there and

379
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,440
you can also use yara to assist with

380
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,880
detection there

381
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,519
so even if your ids or your nid's alert

382
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,880
didn't trigger

383
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,880
if a file was extracted by zeke or

384
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,199
circada on the wire and we've examined

385
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,880
it with stroka and we do this

386
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,680
automatically within security and then

387
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,600
then we can generate an alert if it

388
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,600
matches a yara rule that you know from

389
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,920
the file level stroke is able to

390
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,120
determine

391
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,959
so again it's allowing you to build

392
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,600
those layers of detection and really be

393
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,880
able to help with that overall

394
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,959
visibility

395
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,600
and uh you know similar to the

396
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,959
unit alerts

397
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,279
will also generate an alert

398
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,880
in a console where you can review that

399
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,279
for those yara rule matches

400
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,040
and one other important thing with

401
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,800
stroka is that even if a file is in

402
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,000
a zip file or an archive file we can

403
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,079
still get data about the different files

404
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,560
in there and see what its analysis gave

405
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,600
us and that helps us as an analyst

406
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,560
by

407
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,959
determining a certain number of things

408
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,040
about the file before we have to perform

409
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,199
manual analysis it gives us a better

410
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:57,160
place to start our investigation

411
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,720
now i mentioned alert data a little bit

412
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,680
from circada generating mids alerts but

413
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,360
we really have different types of alert

414
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,720
data as well

415
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,959
uh so that nids that network intrusion

416
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,120
detection system those those mids-based

417
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,639
alerts we have those

418
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,639
and we also have those hits based alerts

419
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,600
so host-based ids like wazoo and things

420
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,360
that are coming from the host from you

421
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,360
know things like osprey

422
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,959
we have playbook which i haven't

423
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,639
discussed yet but that'll be another

424
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,320
type of alert data that we have

425
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,000
available to us and that's going to be

426
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,240
searching just all sorts of log data not

427
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,560
just from one particular

428
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,480
observer or tool

429
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,320
and then we also have custom alerts that

430
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,519
if we have other data that we're

431
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,199
bringing in other sources we can

432
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,199
generate alerts from those as well and

433
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,519
have those populated to the same console

434
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,199
where we review the other alerts

435
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,839
and i mentioned a lot of other data

436
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,600
right i mentioned all of the

437
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,279
other data sources that we can bring in

438
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,279
with security i mean uh bringing to

439
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,880
security and and

440
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,000
really

441
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
you know it's any data right so we have

442
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
all these different types of data here

443
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,839
uh cloud data authentication data

444
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,160
firewall and syslog data and we can

445
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,120
enrich that data however we see fit in

446
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,959
those elastic search and log stash

447
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,519
pipelines so a lot of flexibility there

448
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,839
as far as how we want to build context

449
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,600
or how we want to augment our current

450
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,920
data sets

451
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,360
now all of this data together right it's

452
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,040
if you have all this data together and

453
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,959
you don't know necessarily how to relate

454
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,120
it all and how to go back and forth

455
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,440
maybe other than ip addresses

456
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,600
or you know source ip or deskt or

457
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,639
whatever

458
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,079
there are a lot of other ways that we

459
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,160
can tie this data together

460
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,800
and this is really what we

461
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,800
part of our i guess our secret sauce or

462
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,279
what we like to to do with our data as

463
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,360
far as you know within the security and

464
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,199
realm is being able to tie all these

465
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:54,959
data points together

466
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,800
and it makes it really useful when you

467
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,800
have things like community id

468
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,600
and the zqid and fuid

469
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,680
the community community id is going to

470
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,599
be generated by the source and

471
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,000
destination ip address and then also

472
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
ports right source desk ports and then

473
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,039
protocol

474
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,039
and then there's some stuff that goes on

475
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,319
behind the scenes there and that's

476
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,480
generated so that's unique for every

477
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,720
flow that we have and whether that's

478
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,679
across z connection logs or circada nidz

479
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,720
alerts or even win log b or sysmon logs

480
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,959
right network connections um we can see

481
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,200
all of that together so if we search for

482
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,120
that community id we'll see all of these

483
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,880
logs grouped together

484
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,520
right and then from there we can go over

485
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,440
maybe from the wind log beat or sysmon

486
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,679
log from the network connection we have

487
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,480
a process id and from that process id we

488
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,799
can go to the web logb or sysmon file

489
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,280
creation process creation all of that

490
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,320
good stuff

491
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,080
right from the community id we can also

492
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,120
go over to the zqid so zeek has its own

493
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,840
internal identifier for connections and

494
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,160
for files that traverse the network and

495
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,960
you can see this chain of pivot points

496
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,039
and connections here where we can tie

497
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,240
all of that together and that's part of

498
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,320
what makes security engine really

499
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,840
really powerful

500
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,600
so really great things there i'll

501
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,720
demonstrate that a little bit here in

502
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,960
just a minute

503
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,080
i want to talk about the interfaces

504
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,600
where you will review this data

505
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,320
so

506
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,320
the first interface i'll get into is

507
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,160
kind of the overarching interface in

508
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,440
security

509
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,160
this interface we call stock or security

510
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,559
and in console and you can see here that

511
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,160
it's got a fair number of links on the

512
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,080
side and it's got a little

513
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,320
little customizable overview dashboard

514
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,840
here if you wanted to change that out

515
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,000
and have your own little kind of portal

516
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,880
and graphic and data memes there you can

517
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,559
do that as well

518
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,480
so um you know all of that's there for

519
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,280
you

520
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,799
but again you know i'll talk through

521
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,240
each of these there's lots of different

522
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,919
things here

523
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,320
that we can get into from stock and this

524
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,160
is really intended to be your jumping

525
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,760
off point when you're logging into

526
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,000
security and into the web interface and

527
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,760
starting your investigation or starting

528
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,080
your hunting or whatever you want to do

529
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,919
this is intended to be the place where

530
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,400
you start

531
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,200
and i mentioned hunting

532
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,840
hunt is another part of that security

533
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,120
and console and inside of hunts we've

534
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,679
tried to capture the ability to hunt

535
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,840
through that network and host and other

536
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,480
types of data and be able to perform

537
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,280
these operations to stack this data and

538
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,120
make it really useful

539
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,440
and i guess it's probably not executed

540
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,039
as best as it can be or illustrated as

541
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,400
best it can be right here but i'll show

542
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,559
that a little bit but what this allows

543
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:41,919
us to do

544
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,960
is to search for specific types of data

545
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,520
um you know or certain fields or whatnot

546
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,120
and then we can group that data we can

547
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,240
stack it and organize it by count by

548
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,320
certain fields and then we can also

549
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,480
drill into that data each event and we

550
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,240
can perform different actions here which

551
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,240
i'll get into in a minute

552
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,039
but

553
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,919
hunt was originally developed just as a

554
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,440
way

555
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,520
to perform those rubies right to perform

556
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,600
that free form hunting and

557
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,760
be able to stack that data and see the

558
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,000
anomalies and see what what isn't quite

559
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,480
right there

560
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,720
now

561
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,280
similarly we have an alerts console and

562
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,679
if you've used security on n1604 before

563
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,320
you may have used sweel there was a

564
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,480
squeal client and also squirt which was

565
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,480
a web-based client where we would review

566
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,360
these

567
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,280
these alerts right whether it be that

568
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,799
network data network alerts or

569
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,039
host-based alerts or in this case even

570
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,799
yara matches or

571
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,720
uh playbook alerts we would review all

572
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,720
of that here

573
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,320
and you can obviously see we can group

574
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,640
by there's details here we can search

575
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,559
and then we can also acknowledge these

576
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,159
alerts so if we don't want to see these

577
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,000
alerts anymore we can just click this

578
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,320
little icon right here to do that and

579
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,520
then we can

580
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,000
escalate these alerts to a case excuse

581
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,880
me

582
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,960
uh so we also run the hive which i'll

583
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,120
talk about just a minute and secure it

584
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,600
in or we give you the option to

585
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,360
and you can escalate this alert to a

586
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,520
case so if you have an alert that you're

587
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,360
not quite sure about you've investigated

588
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,080
it

589
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,240
and you know you want to have a senior

590
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,159
analyst maybe take a look or you want to

591
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,400
save it for later you can escalate that

592
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,159
to a case in the hive and then continue

593
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,000
your investigation there

594
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,960
so really cool to be able to do that

595
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,080
inside of that web interface

596
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,679
and we also have pcap our pcap interface

597
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,480
is where we can pull that pcap for a

598
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,919
relevant event in hunt or in alerts and

599
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,360
then we can

600
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,600
go off and and you know kind of peruse

601
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,919
that pcap the full pack of capture data

602
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,159
we can see the transcript here there are

603
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,400
different formats that you can put it in

604
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,760
if you want you know if you want to see

605
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,520
the hex as well it's kind of cut off

606
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,280
here but uh you can just want to

607
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,559
illustrate how

608
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,200
you can kind of tweak this to to be to

609
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,360
your liking uh so a lot of great stuff

610
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,120
there if you're looking to dig more into

611
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,120
that event and you kind of investigate

612
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,039
it down and narrow down a set of events

613
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,039
you can start to peruse that p cap and

614
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:07,840
see

615
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,120
the actual conversation on the wire

616
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,919
and then cabana so if any of you have

617
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,080
used the elastic stack i know it's very

618
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,640
popular these days especially for uh

619
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,880
security teams and for investigations

620
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,360
and for housing that data

621
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,039
we do use the elastic stack behind the

622
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,760
scenes uh for punts and for alerts but

623
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,840
kibana provides us you know a different

624
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,600
interface into that we won't have that

625
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,480
same

626
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,960
group by capability in kibana but we do

627
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,840
have the ability to create custom

628
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,720
dashboards now we can create some pretty

629
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,480
dashboards for management if they want

630
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,559
to see that or if there are things that

631
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,039
we search for regularly we can do that

632
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,240
as well

633
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,559
right we can have a dashboard for

634
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,240
certain specific things that we want to

635
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,640
look for in logs or maybe certain things

636
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,200
that we may consider an anomaly right we

637
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,799
can create those dashboards and then go

638
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,400
from there

639
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,240
so that's a pretty cool interface that

640
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,720
we include as well

641
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,000
now

642
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,240
aside from the interfaces i do want to

643
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,039
talk about detection development a bit

644
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,360
so with security and then we do provide

645
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,200
a couple ways

646
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,919
aside from traditional needs like

647
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,039
circada rules or wazi rules or other

648
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,720
types of rules in that same similar

649
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,799
domain i do want to talk a little bit

650
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,799
about how we can create some overarching

651
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,520
detections and how we can really use

652
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,679
that or leverage those tools

653
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,880
to increase our detection coverage uh

654
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,280
you know maybe against a certain set of

655
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,679
tactics or techniques that we might want

656
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,919
to have detection against

657
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,600
and start with that i'll introduce

658
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,000
playbook that i introduced earlier uh

659
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
playbook can generate those types of

660
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,760
alerts and we can view those in that

661
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,120
alerts console

662
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,840
but essentially what it is is it's an

663
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,679
application where we can take things

664
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:56,720
like

665
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,240
sigma rules if you've heard of sigma

666
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,200
before

667
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,240
it's a generic sim format for searching

668
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,520
for data so if we have a splunk backend

669
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,159
or we have an elastic backend

670
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,039
the goal here is to have those rules be

671
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,640
written so that everybody can take

672
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,480
advantage of that query so that

673
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,799
everybody can hunt for windows event

674
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,200
logs being cleared so that everybody can

675
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,039
see the same thing in the end

676
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,600
and it's an awesome goal and

677
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,880
and i really love what they've done with

678
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,640
the project so far

679
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,000
and we really leverage that with

680
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,559
playbook what we do is we allow you to

681
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,240
take the sigma rules that are shared

682
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,840
within the community for those that we

683
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,480
can convert to those different back ends

684
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,720
and we can put them in here and track

685
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,279
them as detection plays is what we call

686
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,240
them

687
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,400
and what happens from there is that

688
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,600
playbook will automatically convert the

689
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,919
sigma rules over into the appropriate

690
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,240
elasticsearch query in the last alert

691
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,880
rule for us and we'll also automatically

692
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,120
convert these plays to

693
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,600
case templates and hive so that

694
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,120
if we're doing an investigation in the

695
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,520
hive when we see an alert come up and we

696
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,520
merge it you know it gets escalated to a

697
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,400
case

698
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,400
then we can associate certain common

699
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,600
tasks for maybe a you know a tier two

700
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,320
analyst or tier one analyst to do right

701
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,480
we can have this task defined in that

702
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,960
tape sorry case template

703
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,880
and have that automatically applied

704
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,120
whenever this rule fires so that once we

705
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,200
get an alert we know exactly what we

706
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,320
need to do

707
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,120
so the power not only lies in automating

708
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,600
the you know conversion of sigma but

709
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,159
also in you know the investigation and

710
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,240
response phase as well

711
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,600
so it's super cool to be able to have

712
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,679
that new platform and and really

713
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,120
encourage folks to use that when they

714
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,840
can

715
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,000
now one of the things one other thing

716
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,159
that playbook does and that we can do

717
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,120
within security again is uh generate a

718
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,760
layer for attack navigator if you

719
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,200
haven't heard of attack navigator

720
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,480
there's a link below

721
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,919
you can go check that out but

722
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,840
essentially we can map our detection

723
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,679
coverage to the planes that we have

724
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,440
enabled the last alert rules that we've

725
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,039
created in security

726
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,799
and we can map those against the motor

727
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,039
attack framework we can review that

728
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,039
interface so i guess it is considered

729
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,039
another interface but we can review that

730
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,360
interface to see what we've mapped our

731
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,120
detections against

732
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,039
and a lot of folks get kind of caught up

733
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,120
with attack navigator and trying to

734
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,679
detect all the things or trying to

735
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:26,240
fill up the chart right with all blue

736
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,840
i really want to encourage folks to

737
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,640
focus on their threat model right really

738
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,960
ascertain what that is and then

739
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,799
trying to figure out you know from a

740
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,559
priority standpoint

741
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,720
where that detection should be

742
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,320
and where you should map

743
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,159
and try to have coverage so

744
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,880
that capability is there but just uh you

745
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,400
know just be sure to leverage that

746
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,120
responsibly

747
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,600
now i talked about case management a

748
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,000
little bit i mentioned uh escalating

749
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,240
alerts from the alerts console to the

750
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,840
hive and that's what i'm going to talk

751
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,760
about here just a little bit you can see

752
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,000
that we have a case here about a coin

753
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,480
miner and we've got a little tag here

754
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,919
just saying that it came from security

755
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:07,039
ending

756
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,880
and then we've got the event details

757
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,039
under here in the description

758
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,559
so if we had a playbook uh play if it if

759
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,640
this is fire the original alert would

760
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,440
fire

761
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,039
via playbook play

762
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,880
then we would have some actions or some

763
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,640
tasks already populated here that we

764
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,120
need to take and then in this case we

765
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,480
did not but

766
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,399
um you know we can see that that ricky

767
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,720
bobby here has got some work to do right

768
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,799
so uh

769
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,640
so we can do that and then again you

770
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,960
know with the hive and cortex if you're

771
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,360
not familiar with vortex already uh we

772
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,120
implement cortex and security in it as

773
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,120
well so if you wanted to run certain

774
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,200
analyzers against observables that

775
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,919
you've attached to this case you can go

776
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:50,080
off and look for ip or domain or hash

777
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,679
information for those and there's tons

778
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,600
and tons of different analyzers that

779
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,919
i'll let you review from the cortex side

780
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,399
as you get time but again really great

781
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,000
to be able to have that functionality in

782
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,960
there

783
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,880
now as far as deployment i want to talk

784
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,080
about deployment real quick there's a

785
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,760
few different models a few different

786
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,799
modes

787
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,480
the first is i'm going to talk about is

788
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,399
going to be import node and what this

789
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,000
allows you to do is quickly and easily

790
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,399
import a pcap or multiple pcaps into

791
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,559
security engine this does not run any

792
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,640
active services it only runs services

793
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,320
whenever you run the pcap through

794
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,240
security ending so if you've got an

795
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,120
academic use case or a one-off forensics

796
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,880
use case or you know where you don't

797
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,799
want to run the entire stack you can

798
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,520
absolutely do that here and it is um

799
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,120
obviously it's going to be less resource

800
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,399
taxing than a full-on deployment

801
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:39,200
so

802
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,480
we have some docks that i'll mention at

803
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,760
the end and you can go ahead you can

804
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,840
review that there but it's really great

805
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,279
for performing that you know somebody

806
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,279
gives you a pcap and you want to see

807
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,640
what it does you want to see all the z

808
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,080
logs and all the mids alerts and

809
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,840
everything else that it generates

810
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,600
it's really super cool for doing that

811
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,080
kind of thing and very valuable for that

812
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,840
now evaluation mode is going to be

813
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,159
another mode that we have uh evaluation

814
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,919
mode performs that live traffic

815
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,000
monitoring but it's going to

816
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,399
enable everything with kind of just some

817
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,880
base set of configurations and it's not

818
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,880
ideal at all for production so please

819
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,960
don't use this for production but this

820
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,720
allows you to see all of that data that

821
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,360
we discussed in in addition to that live

822
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,240
traffic monitor

823
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,760
standalone mode is going to be a little

824
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,520
bit different from eval mode and that

825
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,440
it's a little beefier it's a little more

826
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,880
refined i guess

827
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,320
as far as the way the configurations are

828
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,880
handled and we actually uh we do have

829
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,720
folks who use this for production use

830
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,880
although we don't recommend it but you

831
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,880
know if you're running it more than

832
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,360
um you know like 500 megabits per second

833
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,640
and you probably don't want to be

834
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,039
running a standalone right it also

835
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,880
performs that live traffic monitoring

836
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,360
and allows you to configure most of

837
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,799
those components as you see fit

838
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,840
the distributed mode is going to be the

839
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,760
one that we recommend deploying security

840
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,080
and the most frequently

841
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,279
if you're running an enterprise

842
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,279
environment or plan two

843
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,960
you know from the start we recommend you

844
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,039
try to start with a distributed mode if

845
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,320
at all possible

846
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,240
in this mode you can run a manager as a

847
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,279
vm but we really do recommend running a

848
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,200
search node or a sensor

849
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,799
which are going to be performing those

850
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:21,120
storage and sensing components

851
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,640
we really do recommend that you run

852
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,559
those in a physical

853
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,799
on a physical machine

854
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,080
and again all this you can get more

855
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,919
details about this on our read the dock

856
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,080
site

857
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,399
so in addition to those those

858
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,320
you know kind of on-prem or local models

859
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,240
we also have some other models in which

860
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,880
we can deploy security and in the cloud

861
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,960
if you have a hybrid infrastructure uh

862
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,640
where i say hybrid in the sense of

863
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,840
on-prem and cloud such as aws and gcp

864
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,440
you can absolutely do that you can have

865
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,679
a sensor up in aws or gcp and then a

866
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,159
manager down below it on-prem

867
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:55,840
or you can have it vice versa or you can

868
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,360
have all cloud there's lots of

869
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,039
possibilities there and with aws and gcp

870
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,559
uh there's that traffic marine that's

871
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,640
available to you out of the box right we

872
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,080
don't have to go around our ankles to

873
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,080
try to get that mirror into security and

874
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,919
it's just all there

875
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:11,679
so a lot of good stuff there and we do

876
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:13,120
have an ami

877
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,200
and the amazon

878
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,519
marketplace aws marketplace if you'd

879
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,640
like to check that out as well

880
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,840
now as far as integrations um talk a

881
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,120
little bit very briefly about

882
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,559
integrations just really some

883
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,559
opportunities here

884
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:29,519
um

885
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:30,960
some opportunities here that you might

886
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,480
have for integration with security and

887
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,240
in a lot of folks like

888
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,120
uh jupiter for data analytics so if the

889
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,080
elastic stack or lens or cabana isn't

890
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,600
working out for you you can certainly

891
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,840
use jupiter for some more advanced

892
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,440
methods

893
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,399
you can

894
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:47,840
tie in remote idr if you've got

895
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,960
crowdstrike or velociraptor you can you

896
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,600
know attempt to tie that data in and add

897
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,080
that other functionality in as well

898
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,159
there's a few examples down below that i

899
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:00,080
put some links to where we've done a few

900
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,640
of these things like with miss and some

901
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,559
uh honey tokens and all that sort of

902
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:05,600
thing so

903
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,640
there are definitely lots of

904
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,240
opportunities there just want to get the

905
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,480
juices flowing as far as what's possible

906
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,880
with that integration

907
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,039
all right so now that i've talked

908
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,039
through security analysis a bit i want

909
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,320
to go through a little bit of demo and

910
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,320
get you guys in the interfaces and see

911
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,559
what that looks like and uh and see what

912
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,640
you might look at as an analyzer as an

913
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,159
administrator

914
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,279
so let me go ahead and pop off of this

915
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,200
whoops backwards

916
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,679
all right let me get out of here and

917
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,440
hop over

918
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,559
let's see if i can swipe

919
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:44,000
i have to see yeah i'll just minimize

920
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,440
this here

921
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,519
all righty

922
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,559
maximize this all right so right here as

923
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:53,440
i mentioned before we have sock uh so

924
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,360
this is the security engine console that

925
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,720
jumping off place that i mentioned

926
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,679
before

927
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,279
and we'll go ahead and jump into those

928
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,279
alerts that we saw before

929
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,519
right so we can see all of these awesome

930
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,440
alerts here these nid alerts mainly that

931
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,840
we see here from surakata uh since we

932
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,200
run circada as our alert generation for

933
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,880
security

934
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,320
all right or at least that ninja

935
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,320
generation and we can see different

936
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,679
details here

937
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,919
right if we wanted to drill into one of

938
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,320
these there are some options here where

939
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,240
we could include or exclude this in a

940
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,799
search or only search for this alert

941
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,000
and there's some drill down

942
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,480
functionality um right now so if we

943
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,480
drill down into that event we can see

944
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,240
all of the events that were related to

945
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:34,960
it

946
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,559
and now there's only one related to this

947
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,399
one so we don't necessarily see multiple

948
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,559
here but just gives you an idea what we

949
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,000
can do there

950
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,320
we were to click again we get that same

951
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,640
kind of uh menu here and if we wanted to

952
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,399
copy any values here we could certainly

953
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:50,480
copy a value of the field or

954
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,120
copy of the event if we wanted to

955
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,799
then we can perform some additional

956
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,200
actions so if i wanted to go and look

957
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,120
over and hunt i could do that if i

958
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,440
wanted to correlate i could do that so

959
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,600
what correlate means is that

960
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,840
for certain types of records we'll take

961
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,600
a you know certain pieces of information

962
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,199
and we'll attempt to

963
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:12,079
search hunt or search elastic for that

964
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,159
data and see if we find any records that

965
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,000
match that condition

966
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,239
and in this case uh if it's a nid's

967
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,399
alert generated by certicata

968
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,119
we will have a network community id so

969
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,719
if we drill in

970
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,879
you can see the various details the desk

971
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:27,760
ip

972
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,239
uh event module their circada

973
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:33,040
right and then some other rule data

974
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,800
right some network data that was decoded

975
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,159
okay that's kind of interesting i see a

976
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,000
miner.exe

977
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,760
right we have the decoded packet data

978
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,000
there there at least some of it

979
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,599
and then we have this network community

980
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:45,599
id and this is that id and i was talking

981
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,199
about before where we can pivot to

982
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,480
different events

983
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,839
now we don't necessarily have to click

984
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,520
on this field to do the correlation and

985
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,280
we'll do that behind the scenes anyway

986
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,040
but if we go ahead and click correlate

987
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,000
here

988
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,320
we can see that we're pivoted over to

989
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,400
hunt and the you know where we can

990
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,920
search more

991
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,000
for that data and then we'll see these

992
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,079
these grouped events right we're

993
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:08,400
grouping by the event module which is

994
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,480
cerakata zeke and sysmon in this

995
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,079
instance at least in the events that it

996
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:14,240
found and then we see these data sets of

997
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,000
events so we can see sysmond network

998
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,960
connections and zeke http logs and z

999
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,880
connection records and the cerakata

1000
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,800
alert all tied together by this one

1001
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,800
community id

1002
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,040
and then we could go peruse that data if

1003
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,119
we wanted to right

1004
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:30,560
you could go drill down to those

1005
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,480
individual events but

1006
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,720
in this case you know maybe i want to

1007
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,079
you know i'm kind of interested in the

1008
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,400
host level right so i saw that alert

1009
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,920
from the network level and i see this

1010
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,520
http data

1011
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,440
but maybe i just want to filter on

1012
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,119
sysmon for now

1013
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,800
so all right well i've only got the

1014
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,720
assist mama now and then we can see some

1015
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,280
details like the

1016
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,280
powershell.exe and that sort of stuff so

1017
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,440
i can drill into this event here and get

1018
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,960
some more details

1019
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,960
but if i wanted to see you know even

1020
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,280
more from a correlation perspective what

1021
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,119
other host-based events were tied to

1022
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,079
that

1023
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,119
i can go from that process id so if i go

1024
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,359
on this process id here in the

1025
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:10,800
process.kid

1026
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,880
i just search for that

1027
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,599
then i can see all of these sysmon and

1028
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,079
i'll just exclude osec for now but i can

1029
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:19,920
see all of the other sysmon events that

1030
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,359
were associated with this network

1031
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,599
connection event and we see a process

1032
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,160
creation event and a file creation event

1033
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,160
right and we kind of see the the

1034
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,920
timeline here

1035
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,000
uh if we look down so we see the process

1036
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,480
creation here from powershell.exe

1037
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,640
by brian phillips and we see a file

1038
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,640
creation event here

1039
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,359
we can drill into that right so if we

1040
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:44,000
want to see that ps1 right the file

1041
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
that's that's being targeted to be

1042
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,160
created on disk you can see that and

1043
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,839
then we can see obviously the network

1044
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:51,520
connection there

1045
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:56,079
by that host windows 10 ws2

1046
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,400
right and then if we look we see some

1047
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,320
details here right we see a destination

1048
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,160
hostname or whatnot

1049
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,119
all right but if we keep going down

1050
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:09,400
and we see that process creation

1051
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,040
and then we see the resulting minor.exe

1052
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,760
again that we saw and that nids alert so

1053
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,359
you know being able to tie it back from

1054
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:18,880
that nids alert and drill down really

1055
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,200
into the host and trace it specifically

1056
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,119
to you know that windows event logger

1057
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,280
that sysmon event uh is really powerful

1058
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,960
in a sense right we're walking it all

1059
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,200
the way back there

1060
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,440
right and then if we go back

1061
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,000
even so another pivot point maybe if we

1062
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,040
go back aside from the process id and we

1063
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,000
focus back to those network events

1064
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,240
all right and we look at zeke http we

1065
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,520
can see

1066
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,119
if we drill in on the http there

1067
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,280
if there was a file downloaded usually

1068
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,359
the protocol log or the session data

1069
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:52,880
like http

1070
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,280
will have an fu id associated with it

1071
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,119
that file id

1072
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,680
so if we expand this record here

1073
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,480
we can see this log id

1074
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,960
fu ids and we see this value here

1075
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,680
and if we were to copy this value

1076
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,078
then we could see even more stuff right

1077
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,240
so if we do that and actually let me do

1078
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,800
a group by

1079
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,040
module

1080
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,119
we can see that i mentioned stroka the

1081
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,560
file uh

1082
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,560
file detection oriented i'm sorry

1083
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,000
detection or

1084
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,560
file oriented detection right um you can

1085
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,160
see that there right where it performs

1086
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,599
some analysis uh related to that z http

1087
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:36,560
record

1088
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,880
and so if we scroll down and we just

1089
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,920
filter on stroke just include that

1090
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,599
we can see some data here this is the

1091
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,320
largest file at least the largest event

1092
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,480
from structure that we have

1093
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,400
we can see all of that

1094
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,800
preliminary analysis right we can see

1095
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,720
all of the stuff these symbols

1096
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,960
um all of that here right delete

1097
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,280
critical section the critical section if

1098
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,520
we keep scrolling up

1099
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,359
i mean there's just all lots and lots of

1100
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,119
stuff here right

1101
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,520
all right you've got the pe file info

1102
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,400
right using my internet easy minor setup

1103
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,160
so it looks like it definitely looks

1104
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,119
like a bitcoin miner from here and if we

1105
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,280
wanted to take it a bit further you know

1106
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,440
we could go to if i look up here to the

1107
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,560
file

1108
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,320
where is it

1109
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,880
all right this right here so if we

1110
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,440
actually wanted to go into our

1111
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,200
executables that were processed by

1112
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,400
stroka this lives on disk we can go take

1113
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,160
this file and go perform additional

1114
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,920
analysis on it we can go carve stuff out

1115
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,720
of it

1116
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,320
right so it's super awesome to be able

1117
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,400
to have the capability in here

1118
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,119
and

1119
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:45,200
again i'll just kind of go walk it back

1120
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,119
over to the alert and even if i wanted

1121
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,359
to drill down from here again with that

1122
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,200
pcapps interface

1123
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,200
i mentioned just pivoting the pcapp from

1124
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,200
an event we can do that as well if we

1125
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,839
want to just jump straight to pcapp

1126
00:39:57,839 --> 00:39:59,599
right so we'll give it a second here

1127
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,359
it's trying to go pull that pcap and

1128
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,599
i'll just refresh the page here

1129
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,839
and look at that again you know we saw

1130
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:07,440
some of this data from the network data

1131
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,680
decoded from circada but now we're able

1132
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,839
to see the whole transcript

1133
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:14,640
right and we're able to if it's vxlan

1134
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,560
and cap if you're recording in the cloud

1135
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,720
we can unwrap these packets

1136
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,119
for vxlan encapsulated data so that's

1137
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,319
super awesome

1138
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,079
right and then you can format it if you

1139
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:25,280
want to look at it a different way you

1140
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,119
can do all these different ways you can

1141
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:28,640
absolutely do that and then when you're

1142
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,160
ready if you're ready you can go

1143
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,240
download that pcap right here and then

1144
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,000
go perform other analysis if you want to

1145
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,599
get somebody to go

1146
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,640
look at it in wireshark right or perform

1147
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,480
if you have an analyst vm set up and you

1148
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,160
want to run network miner on it and

1149
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,920
extract certain files

1150
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,920
other files you can do that

1151
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,319
so a lot of utility there as far as what

1152
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:51,119
you can do from that pcapp interface

1153
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,920
you know from the events and from alerts

1154
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,920
again if i wanted to search you know

1155
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,400
just for that host if we go back real

1156
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,640
quick

1157
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,520
okay

1158
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,160
we'll just go back from this

1159
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,000
and

1160
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,319
try to go back here a second and get the

1161
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:14,560
host

1162
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,839
that was associated

1163
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:21,440
dvd include

1164
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,160
so if we want to take this also right if

1165
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,240
we wanted to just hunt

1166
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,640
um there are a lot of default queries in

1167
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,400
here where we could just hunt you didn't

1168
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,800
know that that message there but um for

1169
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,880
cismod username sysmon events all these

1170
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,079
are built in

1171
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:37,839
right but if we wanted to perform our

1172
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:41,119
own freeform hunting

1173
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,599
oops we can search that way

1174
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:45,520
i don't know if we want to group by

1175
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,359
different criteria

1176
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,520
we can do that here if we want to do uh

1177
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,760
let's see

1178
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,160
that dot

1179
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,119
set

1180
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:59,359
can't spell on tv

1181
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,880
creation

1182
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,280
all right you can group by maybe time

1183
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,119
stamp maybe process dot executable

1184
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,040
i'll probably spell that

1185
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,680
let's see

1186
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:25,599
oh and i'm sorry

1187
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:27,920
all right then we can do you know we can

1188
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,319
we can see certain details there right

1189
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:32,400
um there's just lots of different ways

1190
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,520
that you can go

1191
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,839
and you know hunt and kind of format the

1192
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:37,359
data how you want to see it and that's

1193
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:39,280
just you know again some examples of

1194
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,560
those ways

1195
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,560
now real quick before we part i also

1196
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,720
want to show you a few other things

1197
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,160
so i'll try to squeeze those in real

1198
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:46,960
quick

1199
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,160
the grid the grid is another way to

1200
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,200
monitor

1201
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,200
uh you know how your your security

1202
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,960
engine grid is doing you can see health

1203
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,560
metrics here you can see events per

1204
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,640
second if we're ingesting data

1205
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,800
other details about the version the name

1206
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,280
and whatnot it just helps you to give

1207
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,200
or get that kind of overall sense of how

1208
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,680
your deployment's doing

1209
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,240
downloads is where we host the

1210
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,000
package downloads if you want to install

1211
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,960
an agent like os query or wazoo or win

1212
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,119
log b we have some locally hosted

1213
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,200
versions here related to those latest

1214
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,720
versions if you need them so you don't

1215
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,000
necessarily have to go out to the

1216
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,319
interwebs and get them um but you know

1217
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:27,839
you're still free to do so

1218
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,760
administration is where we'll just have

1219
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,680
some basic these are administration

1220
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,680
tasks here if you want to perform some

1221
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,760
certain actions or go to the chi chi

1222
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,280
over here we have a cheat sheet for

1223
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,720
security engine for

1224
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,280
a specific commands for the uh for the

1225
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,160
cli so that's pretty useful

1226
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,000
then again we have kibana and then i'll

1227
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,960
dig into grafana real quick

1228
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,960
where i told you we can get those

1229
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,880
detailed metrics right we can see how

1230
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,640
much traffic we're monitoring on this

1231
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,200
link we can see you know how much the

1232
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,720
management interface is seeing if we're

1233
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,800
bringing in events per second

1234
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,760
we can see the log stash traffic here

1235
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,920
you can see different types of details

1236
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,839
about the environment here and again

1237
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:09,359
it's really useful to be able to do that

1238
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:11,359
and i have to log on to every box and

1239
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:12,640
then go you know type all those

1240
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,240
different commands uh it's really great

1241
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,599
to be able to have that under that

1242
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:18,400
single pin class

1243
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,160
cyber chef if you played with cyber chef

1244
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,000
before we include that you can slice and

1245
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,280
dice your data

1246
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,680
uh you know however you see fit there's

1247
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,520
lots of opportunity there for decoding

1248
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,520
certain things um you know taking

1249
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,280
certain bits of data out of the packet

1250
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,359
or out of some event and then acting on

1251
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:36,640
that cyber chef

1252
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,560
and then also i mentioned playbook this

1253
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,240
is where you would go in to create those

1254
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,200
detections uh and create this place and

1255
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,720
you can see we have just a couple

1256
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,920
enabled here

1257
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,880
and if we actually go over to navigator

1258
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,880
i will pop over there real quick

1259
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,319
you can see that those plates that we

1260
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:54,000
have enabled we actually have coverage

1261
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,560
for on that attack navigator layer so

1262
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,560
again that's helping us you know map

1263
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,319
whatever we have

1264
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:01,839
active in playbook

1265
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:04,160
to what we're actually what we have

1266
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,920
coverage for so it's really cool to be

1267
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,560
able to have that capability

1268
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:11,599
um fleet dm if you're deploying ospirit

1269
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:14,000
you can see all of that stuff here you

1270
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,720
can run ad hoc queries here if i wanted

1271
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,880
to select all of the users on this box

1272
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,880
that i have joined to here i can do that

1273
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,160
live query

1274
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,000
and then again those results will be

1275
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
reported uh into security edit

1276
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,319
so i'll just give it a second here and

1277
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:31,920
this would be right here this agent is

1278
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,599
connected to the security and inbox

1279
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:35,680
itself locally so we would see all of

1280
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,640
those users here

1281
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:41,680
right oh i'm gonna spell it that's why i

1282
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,839
can't type

1283
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:45,440
tv typing

1284
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:49,280
all right so give that a second there

1285
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:51,839
and we pull back all those users i mean

1286
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:53,599
we could do this we could slice and dice

1287
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:55,359
all day with this right this is a very

1288
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:58,240
simple use case but again another way

1289
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,720
that we can query all of those hosts and

1290
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,800
or maybe dive into a specific host

1291
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,640
without having to log in and do some

1292
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,480
other sort of connection right rdp into

1293
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,440
the host

1294
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,079
to get that type of data

1295
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:11,680
now i mentioned the hive i'll go over

1296
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,760
that briefly let me log in as ricky

1297
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,680
bobby at security

1298
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,720
dot net

1299
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,760
what that's rick bobby not ricky bobby

1300
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,960
all right

1301
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,640
so we've got ricky bobby logged in and

1302
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,880
again we just have the single case but

1303
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,280
um you can add tasks right if you have

1304
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,520
those um specifically to the case if you

1305
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,520
don't have any already added to that

1306
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,760
template add observables if you want to

1307
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,680
add that you know an ip address or a

1308
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:42,800
file

1309
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,599
right and say

1310
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,839
it's bad

1311
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:50,160
all right

1312
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,720
it's bad

1313
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,560
all right and that'll be associated with

1314
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:57,839
the case and then you can go off and

1315
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:00,319
perform actions on that right i don't

1316
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:01,839
have any responders or analyzers

1317
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:03,280
available right now so that won't give

1318
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,040
me an option to do that but that option

1319
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,280
is there

1320
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,960
all right and i think we've pretty much

1321
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,280
covered that um so as far as the

1322
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,440
interfaces uh i think i'll pretty much

1323
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,040
leave it up now for

1324
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,920
for questions and uh you know if

1325
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,240
let me go back to the to the other page

1326
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,240
here

1327
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:30,640
all righty

1328
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,640
current slide

1329
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,400
all right and again i just want to say

1330
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,880

it helps walk you through how to get the

1353
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:23,280
best out of security and then how to set

1354
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,720
it up and how to

1355
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,559
really dig in and learn how to go

1356
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:28,640
through it as an analyst because uh you

1357
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,400

1358
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,640
bit on this presentation there's

1359

into and lots more utility uh that you
