1
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:03,820
I really appreciate you guys coming

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:07,860
this is how hackers for charity possibly
save me a lot of money

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,990
and I'm your you understand a bit later
why

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,530
my name's Brandon Miller ago by fires
here at least I didn't

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:18,930
Navy I never really had a handle but
whenever someone

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,770
when I first started talking at these
conferences someone said either pick 10

7
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:28,850
will give you one so I should all go if
I Z cuz I'm fat hairy and tell bad jokes

8
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:33,440
so miss my daughter Emily she picked the
name a copy because the first

9
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,468
presentation games at Shrek on

10
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:39,370
and she hated that I called her chicken
in public so she picked her own

11
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:44,928
but this is me I'm just a pajama wearing
hipster I love wearing my onesies

12
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:48,589
around Christmas talking about health
care and drinking hot cocoa with my

13
00:00:48,589 --> 00:00:49,120
family

14
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,059
I'm an analyst dad husband at three

I'm Emily you and I im

22
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:25,298
a photographer for a lot of things other
than nature like my dog

23
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:28,829
which technically I guess is nature
letter on

24
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:32,810
I'm obviously a kid and I have a sister
brother

25
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:37,299
named Irene Isaac and I am a Christian

26
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:40,960
now with the stock is not is
groundbreaking

27
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,380
we did not do you any of this research
ourselves we

28
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:47,600
beg borrow and stole mostly from
drowning on hackers for charity

29
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,640
and he gives up willingly so it's not
like we did anything illegal or

30
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,329
we always give him credit what it is
it's a growth opportunity for Rush

31
00:01:56,329 --> 00:01:59,920
once again I was in the Navy for twenty
years a deployed all hot

32
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,729
so and her formative what I like to call
her formative years I wasn't there

33
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:09,149
so now that we homeschool and I'm not
alone in the Navy

34
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:13,560
we do a lot of things like this together
and wished we will be and a course it's

35
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,170
an opportunity for her to learn

36
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:18,400
I made her do all love it whenever I say
we I mean she

37
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,200
she did everything and then for us
because we're christians

38
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,590
car to serve because we support a
missionary

39
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:30,349
in Kenya actually missionary in Somerset
Kentucky who goes to Kenya

40
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:35,268
I little bit a background so this is a
million she's the one in pain it's the

41
00:02:35,269 --> 00:02:37,239
last time she wore pink at age five

42
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:42,260
that is her second camera with water the
first camera whenever she was 4

43
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,480
there's a little Barbie pink camera only
took 10 pictures

44
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,119
it wasn't satisfying enough or so she
asked for a point-and-shoot

45
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,950
and just because she knew what that was
we went and bought her one

46
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,049
the next year

47
00:02:56,049 --> 00:02:59,360
my in-laws all went to Kenya this is
actually

48
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,250
Rift Valley witches were charming on
skids are in school its kinda funny

49
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,590
small world arm they came back

50
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,750
with all other their stories love with a
did on this medical mission trip and how

51
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,069
they

52
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:14,870
how they helped and thats whenever Emily
declared that she was gonna go

53
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:18,739
and if we win sender she was gonna take
herself she was 6

54
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:23,650
she didn't go in 212

55
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:27,629
up my wife are my my wife's mom my
mother-in-law

56
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:33,018
I am she went back to Kenya and the
purpose for this was the stand-up

57
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:37,079
a clinic the lady on the right her name
is Grace

58
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:40,560
grace was a nurse on a 2006 medical
mission trip

59
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,790
I the reason why she was a nurse she
felt out of

60
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:49,359
out of our medical school which met in
Kenya if you get a BF to repeat that

61
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,150
you're over

62
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:54,719
because she got married her dad dropper
funding so my mother-in-law so how much

63
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:57,099
could medical school costs she said
roughly

64
00:03:57,099 --> 00:04:00,719
two thousand dollars so my mother are my
in-laws paid for it

65
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,430
and said don't pay us back open up a
clinic

66
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:10,790
and help out the locals so that's what
she did they all returned Honam

67
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:15,420
our mission trip and 2012 October so
they went twice that year

68
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,880
and Mamie adopted this school

69
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,790
which you can see the three trees in the
middle there's a school there

70
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:26,680
believe me terrorist at about two hours
north of Nairobi

71
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,800
and literally someone has to run in
front of the vehicle the whole way

72
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,270
they take turns show that you don't hit
potholes are get stuck because there's

73
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,710
no red

74
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:40,030
take turns when we went they didn't take
turns the I just ran

75
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,500
way yeah crazy now two hours away

76
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,020
it's only like 10 miles outside the city
but

77
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:51,880
so but yeah I ran away these are some
other students there's how many

78
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,620
218 think 218 students

79
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,130
Inc any have to pay for your own school
public school cost about two hundred

80
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:00,710
dollars a year

81
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:04,409
that is include your books and your
uniforms

82
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:07,830
this is an orphanage that my
mother-in-law adopted

83
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:11,270
we say or Finnish flash cool because of
the tourney

84
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,370
9 29 students I don't know numbers

85
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:20,250
I just give above the 29 students only
three or four of 'em

86
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:24,220
have funding to go to school so the lady
that runs the orphanage home schools the

87
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,190
rest of them

88
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:28,850
that's for johnnie long hackers for
charity stepped in whenever they heard

89
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:31,390
the story because I stock to them

90
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:34,500
johnnie and shame can chat every

91
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,240
a con from last probably four years

92
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,090
arms and how can I help how can I help
how can help how can I help finding

93
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:46,500
sam turned on to me and said the old one
is from school at US

94
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,570
just adopted hey I can do that and then
I realized

95
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:54,320
she can show

96
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,740
Emily decided she basically said look if
you want let me go to Kenya

97
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,100
I'm just going to be a photographer and
that's when I panicked

98
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,710
I don't know anything about art I don't
know how hard to support themselves

99
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:10,370
arm art to me I can identify our because
I don't know what it is

100
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,030
right I look at something and I go well
that's a wall other two

101
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:17,920
neat looking thing on a shirt that's
probably art that's my extension apart

102
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,000
try literally panicked

103
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,160
yeah and I decided that I was gonna
refocus her energies

104
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,000
into something technical because that's
what I know

105
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,150
so here we are

106
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:35,310
sometimes only clams up that's okay I am

107
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:38,580
so this is our plan we're gonna build a
simple XBMC server

108
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,680
be cuz I want to get rid of DirecTV arm

109
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,140
as a perfect concept it never went live

110
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:49,860
we also get all the movies we got frozen

111
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,600
well but anything that's come out
theoretically that could happen

112
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:59,520
or they never work it's in our lab only

113
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,020
hypothetically so we built the Rachel
pie

114
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:08,080
with our good friends world possible
.org I install Windows 7 on a ThinkPad

115
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,090
that was donated to us

116
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:14,150
in stock rutan yet show

117
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:18,860
who hears every screw time heard on as a
wonderful program

118
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,220
you can I install it on any Chromebook

119
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:26,940
and allows for true dual boot with
another Linux operating system

120
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:31,600
show there's no rebooting are putting it
in Tom developer mode

121
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,180
you literally hit to Keesh in it putsch
that

122
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:39,020
n/a it suspends the state almost like a
VM and

123
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,440
opens up the the other instance such
really nice

124
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,100
she can switch back and forth between
Chromebook and whatever you load we

125
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,430
loaded a move to

126
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,790
arm on the fly nice

127
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:54,750
we were gonna go to Kenya she ended up
going to can you with my wife

128
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:58,450
Naimi install the learning network
server

129
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:03,000
I and teach the staff and then RN game
was the talk at schmoke on

130
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,580
I had always been tryin you know for
years to talk to shrink I never got

131
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,830
picked

132
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:10,880
not complaining I was never really
worthy

133
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,920
I put her name on the smoke on CFP and
she got selected

134
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:19,940
so says she's a minor I get to go with
her

135
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:23,890
set up okay what really happened

136
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:27,680
is he basically followed

137
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,420
a fam around for

138
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:35,599
years home and finally he just bought

139
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:41,849
the hi and then that's when we built the
XBMC servers we can watch dollar

140
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:46,839
be radical stuff and not the Rachel pie

141
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:50,139
went to Kenya and we actually bill

142
00:08:50,139 --> 00:08:54,879
schoolhouse cuz they they're just doing
in a living room

143
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:59,040
and their place to teach the people and
ended up actually using is the norm for

144
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,560
for the girls

145
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,730
has your I'm

146
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:07,470
he installed it talk staff and

147
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,509
then we went to a lot of other places

148
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:15,350
make sure you call my name aid

149
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:19,910
he's a steps to bill Rachel pie

150
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:23,750
him so first one you got a bother at
berry pie

151
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,769
the SD card class 10

152
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:31,889
it has to be class 10 because it's fast
this Renae capability

153
00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:35,230
and you're actually gonna be rendering
video not rendering video

154
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:38,290
but serving up video this is actually a
web server

155
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:41,670
we haven't turned on right now have a
smartphone or anything

156
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:46,349
I look for RPI our pie and you should be
able to load up the

157
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:52,220
course where the kids are using

158
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:55,389
didn't understand a word not really but
I try

159
00:09:55,389 --> 00:09:58,480
own downloaded the break to

160
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:04,660
hi stuff I'm

161
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:10,079
are wrote to the SD card shut up the
server and then and then used

162
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,399
literally its if you print out the steps

163
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:17,790
with pictures its two and a half pages
anyone can do it

164
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:21,180
the difference between what you would do
and what I made her do as I made her do

165
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,949
everything via command line using my Mac

166
00:10:23,949 --> 00:10:29,100
and she didn't discover until we did
this presentation at Lexmark last week

167
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,189
there I actually had all the commands I
just made her go look for them

168
00:10:33,189 --> 00:10:38,459
are a major google it so she lives in

169
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:42,529
right a this is the cost have all the
parts

170
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:46,029
the Raspberry Pi itself is $35 dollars

171
00:10:46,029 --> 00:10:49,410
the whole life I dunkle when word is

172
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:53,019
7 power Spy was nine

173
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:56,110
and then the little glass not glass

174
00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:00,240
but fact will that the Mariners

175
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,810
whatever plastic thing was

176
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:07,689
30 in home

177
00:11:07,689 --> 00:11:12,990
building business building the X team
the server and I took is nice case

178
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:17,209
and phone maker model legos

179
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:24,209
I could take the knife the Kenya

180
00:11:25,329 --> 00:11:29,329
head tell you what

181
00:11:29,329 --> 00:11:33,999
used here where's

182
00:11:33,999 --> 00:11:39,389
a this is the second one the book The
Rachel hi

183
00:11:39,389 --> 00:11:43,360
and the reinstall the operating system
aunt laptop

184
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,100
and yeah it

185
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,949
took forever I don't note its night

186
00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:54,470
we started this about lunch

187
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:57,720
fun who I major read

188
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,139
every screen how many sysadmin so we
have out there ever

189
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:04,790
your I didn't matter click her I me to
read everything

190
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:09,680
so you have to experience that one yet
once in your life three

191
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,240
I don't think so K

192
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,749
it so this is it all gathered up
together you'll know is nice little case

193
00:12:16,749 --> 00:12:18,019
that I to

194
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:23,499
and a little wifi and then to flash
drives message at the Jesus film

195
00:12:23,499 --> 00:12:28,279
to show a church didn't actually a end
up working but we did show it to the

196
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:30,980
school

197
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:35,740
en route to Kenya

198
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:39,199
but yet fully booked the school and this
is what

199
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:43,899
they the boys have been sleeping and it
was basically

200
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:47,870
like things that they had found propped
up together into a shack

201
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:51,189
like a chair a prufer who

202
00:12:51,189 --> 00:12:54,949
I don't know what was in p home so we
actually

203
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:58,360
the frame building

204
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,309
and it's almost done here and this is it
finished

205
00:13:02,309 --> 00:13:07,219
it ended up being the nicest building in
the village

206
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,399
so that was my cuter

207
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,850
bring out the right very tall pine if it
was working

208
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:19,730
and that there is no power they had just
moved

209
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:22,959
old building had power their new
building did not we didn't know that

210
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,589
when are we went

211
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:29,379
so I want to the van cuz I had won the
little

212
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:32,920
things are you plug in the charger

213
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:37,319
it didn't work so at this point

214
00:13:37,319 --> 00:13:41,689
they didn't know I didn't work and
neither did I so she sent me an email

215
00:13:41,689 --> 00:13:45,949
saying how do I i turn this thing on
because I did everything you said

216
00:13:45,949 --> 00:13:49,740
so I responded back with their six easy
steps and then

217
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,480
it still didn't work so she took it
shoot the hotel the

218
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,230
that we are is based out of and this is

219
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:01,819
salami salami as the manager of the
hotel but she got the orphanage

220
00:14:01,819 --> 00:14:05,290
at least twice a week if not more often

221
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:11,589
she taught salami how to use it and then
salami would set it up there

222
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:15,199
when it was all over we decided to go on
safari

223
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,350
because I had never been and we saw some
stuff without

224
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:21,939
who leopard on the first day we saw lie
in

225
00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:25,410
we saw draft and idoney

226
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:29,290
I can't even count love they were
everywhere

227
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:33,360
and then yeah so at this point we she
came back

228
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,930
on a Wednesday and

229
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:40,399
we repacked our stuff and flew out on
Thursday so that we can make a judgment

230
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,610
on

231
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:44,670
show it was a it was a tight space there

232
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:49,470
this is just presenting a smirk on the
really cool thing was joining on King to

233
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,899
russian said hey

234
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:54,879
I you guys finally when cool can I have
five minutes at the end of it as a

235
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:55,879
catcher

236
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:59,410
at the end of our presentation which
fairly similar this

237
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:02,439
he stepped up on stage with this

238
00:15:02,439 --> 00:15:05,498
this is if if this is 1.0

239
00:15:05,499 --> 00:15:08,980
there the Rachel pie this is version 2.0

240
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:12,790
which he calls the Pelican pie so
basically whenever we get our lessons

241
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:13,639
learned

242
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:17,129
I this device actually takes care of

243
00:15:17,129 --> 00:15:21,160
all the issues that we had and will
explain some what that is

244
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,740
it's really cool other one condition
wise

245
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,660
a Emily had to build this so the what
they did was presented her with all the

246
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,319
parts

247
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:32,879
salmon johnnie sat with their for hours
washy soldered

248
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:37,459
taught her how to solder and Dom yes she
had a blast

249
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:41,339
I was terrified I was gonna burn
somebody with that soldering pencil

250
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:46,050
doesn't move your fingers away way in

251
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:49,959
so here's our lessons learned number one
Rachel pi is really easy to build

252
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:53,829
once again six easy steps you can
actually if if they

253
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:58,089
require you to do something I there's a
link to how to do it

254
00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:02,579
so it's great with pictures installing
the drivers on the Rachel pie from a Mac

255
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:04,329
using the terminal window

256
00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:08,689
are is really confusing that was her
take away like I said

257
00:16:08,689 --> 00:16:11,748
I had the Chi Chi she didn't know about
last week

258
00:16:11,749 --> 00:16:15,959
she really got stock in couldn't get it
from Google than I would

259
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:20,259
I would sure how to do it if the maker
recommends apart use that part this wifi

260
00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:24,420
dongle costs seven dollars I wanted to
save a dollar cuz I found one that costs

261
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,350
six

262
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:30,009
and um yeah I didn't work the drivers
were incompatible

263
00:16:30,009 --> 00:16:33,459
so you know it cost ish three days
really

264
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:36,639
well we got the new part I'll

265
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,769
Raspberry Pi recommends 1.5 and power
supply

266
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:46,749
that's perfect for Raspberry Pi unless
you throw in the wireless dongle

267
00:16:46,749 --> 00:16:50,220
is then some unease wireless on those
actually will draw one amp up our

268
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,379
themselves

269
00:16:51,379 --> 00:16:55,879
so keep that in mind I recommend at
least to an

270
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:59,129
more lessons learned doesn't work well
on dirty power

271
00:16:59,129 --> 00:17:04,140
the problem with the van and just about
everything that puts out power in Kenya

272
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,870
is there a voltage regulators absolutely
shock

273
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:12,209
so whenever it shares its putting out
five Oaks you could get one vote to 12

274
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:13,589
volts

275
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:19,079
show Pelican pie takes care of that it's
got it on voltage regulator internal

276
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:23,000
I have a backup plan even though this is
wireless

277
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,250
because it has a Ethernet poor I share
her with a router and

278
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,790
cat-5 cable so if they couldn't get the
wireless working

279
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:35,670
no problem and then we'll which she
discovered was one of the worst

280
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:40,250
teaching salami was at Linex was a
little bit too hard for the end users

281
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,020
there

282
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:45,480
from figures long I would would know how
you could pick up on it because she was

283
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,680
manager at the hotel should use
computers for a few years

284
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,180
but going from when does you know

285
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:56,520
click to Linex trying to actually use
some commands

286
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,350
it was a little bit too much so what's
next

287
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:04,959
in lean on the original trip enraged
over a thousand dollars

288
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,090
for this project she Lada herself a
hundred dollars for the project cost 82

289
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:14,689
with the rest of the money shots to buy
a generator I still have install power

290
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:15,610
at the house

291
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:19,650
we just got word that they just got
power installed show in January

292
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:23,060
should talk about six months for them to
get power

293
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:28,629
day the so EF it we still had a buyer
president what's up with that

294
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:32,190
arm three thousand dollars for ticket
was just not enough

295
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:36,090
soap we want to provide more computers
for the kids at the orphanage

296
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:40,250
I'll Lexmark stepped-up they patiently
said we don't

297
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:43,920
handle you know community work at this
level

298
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,680
six computers it's not even worth the
tax refund

299
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,470
and then but we would like to invite you
to to to speak

300
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:54,640
at Lexmark printer the stem committee in
the back

301
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,680
Christian business association: whenever
showed up spoke they gave us six

302
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,770
computers

303
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:04,690
so it's pretty cool I the Pelican pi
wanna bring back the Pelican prior to

304
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,340
replace this one

305
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,629
I in case they have power issues this
bad boy

306
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:13,750
this project gonna do my best vanna
white here

307
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:18,260
show solar power the power port is right
here

308
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,490
if you can get power in it will convert
it

309
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:26,330
so it will do 110 to 240 converted to
you of I volts DC

310
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:29,679
nice pretty clean signal out got a

311
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:33,420
for current time 6 a hour battery

312
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:36,830
we actually a 12 hour battery I just
haven't soldered n

313
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:40,220
arm Scott Rachel pie in there

314
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,450
it also has this little red board from

315
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:47,260
Adafruit were actually allow you to shut
down

316
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:50,520
the Raspberry Pi gracefully raspberry

317
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,180
hi will tell you the proper way to shut
down

318
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:59,540
the pie is poor power and its cuz that's
all they have an anxious to board

319
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:03,070
with this board does you hold this
button down for 10 seconds

320
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:07,760
it starts the i-net command and you can
pre program into Telugu

321
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,090
you want your 0 or whatever you want and
it will gracefully shut down there

322
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:16,590
the Pelican parts that's really nice arm

323
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:21,240
this is version to version 3 of this
actually has HDMI port now

324
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,770
johnnie uses that for showing videos I
it

325
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:29,010
your remote villages and I am so that's
this will have this

326
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:33,390
all day too if you wanna take a look at
it

327
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:38,330
and then we were planning on going back
this summer or fall

328
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:41,710
I'll actually a check for going back
next spring the reason for that my

329
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:42,500
mother Martha

330
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:46,180
person that we're supporting her mission
there she just had knee replacement

331
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,270
she's having the other one

332
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:52,910
shown she's not able to travel we want
to take her with us

333
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:57,470
once again we didn't do any of this on
our own we got it off from somebody else

334
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:02,950
you can choose when here's the links to
all of it

335
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:07,400
are there any questions

336
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:14,400
sir

337
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:21,340
for me the frustration with sitting for
hours in hours and

338
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:27,850
hours on end doing stuff that I had no
idea what I was doing

339
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:31,590
was payoff that 0

340
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,879
okay so in a village that a

341
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,830
director the orphanage name is Jane and
she like she knows

342
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:42,439
don't use a bathroom in your drinking
water

343
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,810
but a lot of people in the village just
I not so

344
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:51,370
this'll hope from learn some other
software on it is actually

345
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:54,600
from the world whore Health Organization
and its

346
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,860
some poor rules to follow and one of
them literally

347
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:02,240
arm is don't pee were you drink

348
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,810
and that was an eye-opener for a lot of
the villagers

349
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:10,139
they're like why not so what does it
matter it's just water

350
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:14,730
so that was a big one for me the the

351
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:19,080
most frustrating their was

352
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,639
not allowing myself to just do it for
her

353
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,810
especially when we were having the
driver issues

354
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:29,060
arm and not cheating in giving her

355
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:32,250
I'm I really did make her do the
research

356
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,340
arm the most rewarding that was just

357
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:39,320
seen her grow SOC started this project
whenever she was 13

358
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,490
she had never spoke publicly ever

359
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:46,360
her first public speaking engagement
wish milk on

360
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,530
but the 2,000 people in the room yes

361
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:54,139
that deserve their absolutely

362
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:57,510
and I'll tell you a quick little story
whenever I got up on stage I turned

363
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,310
around I let

364
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:01,580
while and she looked at me and said

365
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:05,370
dad where they are leaving and
immediately I'm like I gotta protect my

366
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:06,690
daughter you know this

367
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:11,130
are a shisha you know sometime the
previous speaker there probably taken

368
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:14,820
fielding questions outside don't be
upset she just

369
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:18,540
upset at age 10 either leaving is about
right

370
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,820
and I'm like about right there's two
thousand people in this room

371
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:25,159
all like 10 and now I'm so that was cool

372
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:32,160
you edit your question better

373
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:43,120
okay so the question is when I was
discussing the batteries are psyched

374
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:43,940
about the 12

375
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:47,530
I'll 12 hour battery life on on the
bigger battery

376
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:51,030
and apparently no I did not look at
using

377
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:55,370
the USB batteries arm I have one in my
backpack

378
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:58,580
I just ever thought about power in the
Rachel by with it so

379
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:01,919
at Solaris I know once again

380
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,180
no new ideas here we stole from
everybody else

381
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:08,620
so if someone else would have done that
I would have done it to you

382
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:15,620
yes yes

383
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,500
I the question is have you ever thought
about using a secondary K Schwan

384
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,800
inside being used the on outside been
charged

385
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,910
the answer to that is no because

386
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:33,870
we were able to raise a little over two
thousand dollars for this next trip the

387
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,500
rest of its coming out of my pocket

388
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,820
numb sinning for us this time such

389
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:42,590
almost twelve thousand dollars total for
all of us

390
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:46,350
um now this cost three hundred dollars

391
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:50,000
I can't really afford to do to not not
yet

392
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,910
arm but they only have school for a few
hours a day

393
00:24:54,910 --> 00:25:00,100
on if you've ever been Africa there's no
clouds like in Kenya

394
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:04,490
it rains like once a year it just
happens Rainford like six weeks

395
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:07,760
but on so now not not yet

396
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,990
not yet it once we get some are our feet
under us

397
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:17,990
and get accustomed to this I'm will
probably do that

398
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:28,250
yeah

399
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:35,250
right

400
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:50,170
no so we have not been

401
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:53,960
accepting money from anyone I'll

402
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,040
were willing to but I'm not promoting
that

403
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:00,190
the appellation Institute for digital
evidence

404
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:04,880
hired Emily myself as contractors for
their conference

405
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,310
us so we got paid two thousand dollars
for that which is cool

406
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:12,060
the Russian stuff is just people walking
up to attain a missed five ten dollars

407
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:12,570
there

408
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:16,750
sonar we've never really solicited money
in your tuition for law and that's not

409
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,940
what I was rotten

410
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:23,070
arm we believe in the class we give
until it hurts

411
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:26,159
so we have to give until it hurts for we
ask for

412
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:33,160
cell

413
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:37,660
how your yeah now one thing you can do
in johnnie logged in

414
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:40,890
did say was if you go to his website

415
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:44,630
hey he's got two places you can donate
10 miss the long family journey

416
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:47,940
so that goes directly to him the other
owners for hackers for charity

417
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:51,180
you click on that one in in the remarks

418
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:55,090
at our names he would reserve that money
for Ash

419
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:59,350
this is actually the first time I put it
out because that's not what we're

420
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,030
looking for

421
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:07,030
so I do appreciate it and yeah

422
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,800
right break but we don't we also don't
want to compete with johnnie

423
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:17,070
so were doing the same thing different
different areas

424
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:20,870
were not as big so and that is our time

425
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:27,870
as my daughter just wanna die yeah one
minute NeuN last questionnaire

426

427
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:57,000
we have really done at but that's a good
idea
