1
00:00:03,189 --> 00:00:06,189
I and I'm strollin

2
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:13,190
s you guys %uh just of going up

3
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:20,410
like if

4
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:24,190
up right that that

5
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,640
up

6
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,150
from today like

7
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:34,960
about you for quite a while

8
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,170
out

9
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:45,170
I'll up up

10
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,860
were court

11
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:59,860
euro go

12
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:18,920
it other doors open I ob

13
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:27,549
fell further ado years here's part with
personal favorite up

14
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:32,889
doing or showed that

15
00:01:32,889 --> 00:01:36,969
a at eyes out certified

16
00:01:36,969 --> 00:01:40,749
surveilling I P games nixon

17
00:01:40,749 --> 00:01:44,818
hello everyone so

18
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:48,969
before you start drinking your hearts
away and your liver's

19
00:01:48,969 --> 00:01:52,829
up we'll get some more no computer stuff
in

20
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:57,579
so a and it would happen to have an eyes
on

21
00:01:57,579 --> 00:02:01,149
or had one before release this research
back in October

22
00:02:01,149 --> 00:02:05,649
okay so I was on is a camera that

23
00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:09,610
I am is better I think been around for
four years now actually

24
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:14,200
and a lot of the people that were part
of the team that created or actually

25
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,220
former

26
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,260
Mac accessory guys through and through
whether it was

27
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,780
audio or just other kind the Mac
accessories a really really good job

28
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,860
breedlove design which you know I think
it's pretty cool camera actually that's

29
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,090
why I bought it originally

30
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:31,270
one other things though it's like many
things these days

31
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,610
all four years ago this is a little more
interesting iight

32
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,709
you completely mobile enabled it doesn't
a

33
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:41,220
have a web interface native lead for use
as an end-user

34
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:45,450
you set it up with the camera on you
actually use a QR code that will show

35
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,319
you in a second to

36
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,349
to scan all that to parrot but very
simple device very

37
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:54,230
you know very broad obviously between
distribution

38
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:57,299
I for countries in of distribution
through the channels

39
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,850
up interestingly enough Apple stop
signing this camera recently

40
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:06,280
and not sure why that is I don't know if
it's related to this at all but who

41
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:06,660
knows

42
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,859
easier question how many people have a
Raspberry Pi

43
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,670
ok more people ago so I i buy Raspberry
Pi while back

44
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:19,220
and you know setting up of clinic set up
as a stage

45
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,650
you know through my network and
completely forgot to set a static IP

46
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:25,720
I don't know what it was like most
people I just and that my network and

47
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,709
try to figure out where the

48
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:30,750
where this rafter I want and when I scan
my network i'd

49
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,870
in 45 to find this giant will support
that I had no idea why

50
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,230
there on this device what they did et
cetera et cetera on

51
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:42,220
most importantly I thought elements and
if it's twenty you note 13 at the time

52
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,850
and you see Tom entire network

53
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:47,250
and you didn't willingly put tell men on
your network

54
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,090
you Pasha look into that the stuff or
what it's worth

55
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,510
I'm so this was a list the port I saw a
pop up on the spot device

56
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,590
very quickly you know assessed that hey
up

57
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:02,780
I think the one giveaways RTSP which is
on streaming protocol so I seem head Ali

58
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,290
be related I only have one camera online
network so

59
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:09,900
thats by what it is um but certainly
enough ports

60
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,840
offer anyone the kinda be worried about
especially all those TCP ports doing god

61
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,310
knows what

62
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:19,728
the high-range so if you have a device
and really I mean we I was chatting with

63
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:20,260
my wife

64
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:25,409
my body earlier like the the one thing I
think it's los a la security talks is

65
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,580
actually methodology

66
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,130
how you go about doing what you're doing
I so

67
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:34,130
what I do this camera existed I knew it
had telnet and I knew I wanted

68
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:38,390
you horrible things through it I I
decide hey ash make I kinda wish list

69
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:41,550
I'll what those horrible things might be
so

70
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:44,970
I was the first home that I think
everyone would think get a shower right

71
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:45,440
get

72
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,760
hopefully that would be ideal and have
that remote access up but other things

73
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,070
if its running a you know a web service
we saw mobile web service ports

74
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:58,780
if it's if it has RTSP what about the
streaming protocol does that mean for us

75
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:03,409
what access can we get for the video and
the device itself

76
00:05:03,409 --> 00:05:06,469
any embedded device has a few you know
core tenants

77
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:10,409
up from where obviously being one of
them and and other aspects in

78
00:05:10,409 --> 00:05:13,659
it's a camera supply stores data or send
data how do we

79
00:05:13,659 --> 00:05:17,510
intercept that hurt you do things
related to the the camera storage

80
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,870
so again

81
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:24,659
the entire setup is actually done just
with your mobile app I

82
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:27,380
it is an I was the only device so you
have your mobile app you have your

83
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,229
camera

84
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:32,890
I you scan a QR code that you basically
encoded with your SSID and

85
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:36,050
in oppa JIP here whenever

86
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:39,760
and this screenshot when I was spring
this deck together while back I

87
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,190
was kinda lazy and didn't wanna just you
know take a screenshot my phone or

88
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:43,640
something

89
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,360
I don't know why didn't you that but on
so I did a google image search like most

90
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,940
most do and I found this Georgia and I
was like hey you know what's interesting

91
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,510
is

92
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:56,840
this qr-code like from their marketing
materials i were with the QR code says

93
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,370
I look at the QR code I know it's a
little hard to see but

94
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:03,520
on the the actual

95
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,640
network is actually stem office 136

96
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,469
and stem innovation is the company that
makes this camera and then the password

97
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,990
is we love Apple

98
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:15,150
so I've never you know gone out to I
think where they're based in

99
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:18,560
in Utah by drive by their office ever
and happen issues

100
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:25,560
SSID you might wanna try that password
so multicast DNS

101
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:29,050
is one thing that you'll see with a lot
of embedded devices generally if you

102
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:29,890
have

103
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,599
I something pop in your networking needs
to be set up multicast you know this is

104
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,930
a very quick way to help that parent
process get

105
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:40,290
get rolling I we see this with I am of
course IP cameras but things like

106
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,060
printers

107
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:45,360
a a camp like DSLR cameras that have
wifi modules

108
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,760
many similar uses like that so one thing
that we can notice quickly is just some

109
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,539
basics about what the camera is

110
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:55,100
so it has an arm ship which isn't to
pursue pricing and funny when X which

111
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:59,490
also isn't super surprising that the
meeting case most the time we're looking

112
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,650
at devices like these

113
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:05,629
one thing I saw initially though when I
was going you know sorry a look at this

114
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:09,080
this network traffic with the camera is
I did scene when you

115
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,508
basic bootstrap the camera and start up
for the first time after a factory reset

116
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:17,409
it sends over this r/c publishing now

117
00:07:17,409 --> 00:07:21,610
if you see public your network from up
and was like a Camry like oh that's

118
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:24,580
that's good for them it seems like
they're gonna transmit this to me that

119
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,089
and I can

120
00:07:25,089 --> 00:07:28,309
encrypt data and send a back over and
you know have some

121
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:32,069
integrity to this process on we'll talk
about that

122
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:35,749
and in just a second I the one thing
that we do see

123
00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:39,400
and I do mean the one thing that we do
see is the

124
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,539
admin password when it's generated it
actually comes over and it's in cryptid

125
00:07:43,539 --> 00:07:47,289
and a few only thing cryptid with on you
know with that public key to be

126
00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:50,800
deliver in the crib you the private key
on the other side so basically doing a

127
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,610
secure transfer about generating

128
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:56,060
I admin password from one side to the
other so

129
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,229
and that's that's perfectly reasonable
that the I could use a crypto and pretty

130
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,430
common way to do things

131
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,980
onto to jump ahead to slightly in you
guys already know the stocks gonna go

132
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,710
downhill for them for security zone

133
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:09,740
I'm not really spoiler alert in too much
but I 1

134
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:14,030
you know one you little the stove ideas
that you should I know about as well as

135
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:17,280
the camera can only pick up I

136
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,490
attached wanna Canada time that means if
you know like

137
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:24,800
my wife she can't have of the camera
cache her account

138
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,140
and my count the same time which means
you have to have sure credentials if you

139
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,340
wanna have access to this camera which

140
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:34,849
is never a good thing I'll when the
device resets though it does pose to

141
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:35,760
factory mode

142
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,479
these are some that no process output on
the camera

143
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:43,320
and I I really like this part because
it's the most literal thing ever

144
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,550
it's been factory reset completers
worries that like very little thing

145
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:50,750
very few things and software is that
were that strict for what it actually

146
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,620
doing so

147
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:55,320
I found that amusing but the other thing
to know is the admin password

148
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,330
if you do and change that password
everything breaks and

149
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:02,350
it gets really really unhappy with you
so

150
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:05,380
in terms over what you could do to
access this camera

151
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,600
there's certainly %ah broad very
Broadway I

152
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,750
you know number ways to go through
trying to gain access

153
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,150
and depends how much time you wanna
spend you know you could go the route up

154
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:18,959
hey I know this run some web software
lets try to you you know exploit the CGI

155
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,740
ap and try to get like

156
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:24,270
you know remote code execution or
something right okay that's that's one

157
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:24,680
route

158
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,780
I'll because the admin password going
over the wire

159
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:31,439
hurted that seems like a bad idea you
mean you know even though you might not

160
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,510
want to use 1024

161
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:36,069
our essay to do certain things I wasn't
too

162
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:40,210
you know concerned like out actually
want to go down that road

163
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:43,510
it just seems like a fool's errand to
tried you know reports that caused it

164
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,180
could be

165
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:48,140
a five digit are a5 I'll pick me up nam
Tai password it can be it

166
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,730
a hundred digits or something i you know
I don't know so why waste time there's

167
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,040
gotta be a better way

168
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,640
looking at the traffic you can actually
see that it's doing

169
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,350
HDB HTTP Digest mode for all the actual

170
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,970
on a ATP call everything about I just
mowed

171
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,890
that you need to know effectively is a
bunch of data is public about those

172
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:11,160
operations like a bunch of the data
coming over those connections is public

173
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,260
on it's all cleared out a cleartext the
one thing that matters

174
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:19,459
is when you actually compute the digest
about transaction

175
00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:22,760
unless you know the secret key that's
actually creating that said

176
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,180
that he'd I just basically I you can't
do anything

177
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:30,830
so again if we don't have the password
we have nothing with that told that

178
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,980
I'll try to brute force that sure

179
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:37,330
you know we have we have network access
to it up but you know connectivity

180
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,410
issues if there's any

181
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:42,209
modeling built-in if I if the device
just melt become

182
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:46,000
hit you hard the slight downside to that
it's not like I'm doing a local attack

183
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,450
against like a password hash

184
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:50,850
it's not so we can be fast or that that
could have an idea

185
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:55,770
I'm also super impatient and her
modifications nothing I'm super firmly

186
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:57,410
with I've learned a little bit since
then

187
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:00,510
up but it's also not you know that time
the

188
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:04,120
a cuppa tea so things I do know about
I'll

189
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,330
well we'll talk about a little bit a

190
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:10,860
dripping taps secret the maps is
something that's very easy to do with a

191
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:11,870
jailbroken phone

192
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:15,100
I you can do this the hard way you can
GB in you know

193
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,459
you going for a couple stops up but
there are there are applica watch

194
00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:19,550
Arrested crack

195
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:22,670
I that will do the trick the decryption
for you

196
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:26,719
as when you submit an app to the App
Store it's actually in cryptid binary

197
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,510
effectively

198
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:31,339
and when your phone runs of course to
run that app it has to be crib that

199
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:33,060
otherwise it wouldn't be able to do
anything

200
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,310
so effectively what you're doing and and
and the GB route

201
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:39,500
effectively short-circuit batted say out
that app is running

202
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,650
and therefore I'm gonna dump memory and
then save this

203
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:48,030
uninterrupted binary no happy ap so you
can actually I made that very quickly

204
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:52,370
and once you have the app its kinda crap
shoot as to you if you'll find anything

205
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:53,150
interesting

206
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:56,579
lucky for me I found very interesting
stuff in that mobile app

207
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:59,839
and is worse stuff starts in paris by so

208
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,760
I if you are SuperPro you might use I
don't look at stuff like this are hopper

209
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,050
on Mac or something else

210
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:10,790
I'll or also if you're like me and
sometimes just want to get some ASCII

211
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:14,670
austrians is perfectly acceptable to to
find a to so

212
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:18,560
the top one is kinda more broken up at
the bottom one i think is more salient

213
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,290
that bottom image actually shows a bunch
of contact from this mobile app

214
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:27,500
all which is effectively one giant shell
script and what that shell scripts the

215
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,390
fact we doing

216
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:33,230
is its shell script that we'll kinda
bootstrap the firmware upgrade process

217
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:37,230
and in order to do that it actually
connects to telnet

218
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:40,640
as root and then basically haps out

219
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,480
a bash script to start this for market
process that is how this camera was

220
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,030
designed to operate itself

221
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:49,970
with the mobile app so I'll

222
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:54,420
you effectively have just because the
script in there and ask if course

223
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:58,130
you have the rip at username and your
password

224
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:01,790
not just for my camera but for all the
cameras right so

225
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:05,660
this this falls under the guise of not a
default password but hardcore password

226
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,480
and sometimes people complete the two

227
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,100
combo the default password would be like
your

228
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,530
week this writer has admin admin or
something right well in this case

229
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:18,930
I don't know if I'm a consumer an
end-user I don't know that there's an

230
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,760
admin group account on this camera I
certainly don't

231
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,329
I know how helmet is right us on this
case there's nothing I could do about

232
00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:26,730
that as a consumer I'm just

233
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:30,600
up you know I'm lost basically that this
is ahead in value in

234
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,530
and there's nothing I can do about it on

235
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:37,540
so it seems we get a room login I'm
secure LogMeIn great you know

236
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:41,110
geiger shelling and do a little dance so
there's the

237
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:44,570
screenshot everyone takes when they get
rid on anything I'll

238
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:48,610
so one other tell we see a fact that we
just don't curl the running we are you

239
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:51,930
are we are news when X so just give us a
little more detail

240
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:55,209
of course the actual network services
kinda interesting

241
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:58,449
we knew about mostly those because of
course they their mapped publicly

242
00:13:58,449 --> 00:14:02,400
some the TCP job services running our
not public so

243
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,790
is kinda mixture there mike is more
clarity in the house cameras running

244
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:10,380
I'm certainly there's a lot softer on
these devices that make big all that

245
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,660
you know different aspects of my IP
camera stream in saving files and

246
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,780
encoding and all this other stuff work

247
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:19,150
on thats of cool I don't really think
too much look at that

248
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:23,339
other than what I need to do really keep
breaking stuff

249
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:27,640
so the shadow file office was actually
using does gripped

250
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:31,209
which no one should be using desperate
past like 1998

251
00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:34,470
on so this is this is a very common
scenario where

252
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:37,829
organizations will get like standard
firmware from you know some Chinese

253
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:38,810
odiaum

254
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:42,280
and never ever look at it never
interrogated never

255
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:47,689
hatchet or update or anything else and
the admin password to slash admin slash

256
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:51,690
and then Merlin I those are actually
hard put a password that come with this

257
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,370
firmware

258
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:55,400
I had someone else reach out after after
someone saw this talk

259
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,420
and they said hey I know that I know
that username and password

260
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:01,589
and actually showed me the exact
firmware that this device run that was

261
00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:01,890
just

262
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:05,870
open you know to the public from from a
distributor up with those those are hard

263
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:06,900
to passwords in

264
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:10,780
many devices not just this device aus
dem root of course is the

265
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:14,390
it cost them one for the repass were but
not a very good one either

266
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:19,839
on certainly polly I could've helmet up
in a brick or stone and got ask route

267
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,089
without too much trouble

268
00:15:21,089 --> 00:15:24,530
but the thing is a if it to know if it's
known pointedly oh sure I could play

269
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:25,400
Brick Force that

270
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,790
but again if there was an capitals in
their numbers in there anything else or

271
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:29,640
taking Muni

272
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:34,000
a long time mind if I didn't scope what
you know what character sudden stop

273
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,310
so hindsight right

274
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:40,440
in terms of how do you buy that were the
web app is

275
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,990
I punchy for lobby core crass but the
camera

276
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:47,280
I rings one young lady so you know
pretty standard lightweight

277
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,839
what web server on big fan personally

278
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:54,730
and because it's using lady I had seen
previously

279
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:58,400
if you go to the web you know the Weber
you give your basic authentication type

280
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,310
screen son who was doing some some for
access control

281
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:05,790
it's just using i-eighty password
effectively ratio access if you will

282
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:09,199
and so like again I see a user an admin

283
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,920
and I see a hash and I could do an
offline attack against the passions and

284
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,270
see if I can crack down

285
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:17,360
or just look around the file system and
end up finding that there's a config

286
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,050
file

287
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:21,190
that has the clear text equivalents of
those passwords so that

288
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:24,670
I get much easier I like to try to not
waste my time on stupid shit

289
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:28,670
so I'm this case you might see the one
where it says user user

290
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:32,880
that is another hardcoded password that
the the end user has no knowledge I love

291
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,400
has no capability to change

292
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,199
the admin password for more we talk
slightly about

293
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:44,079
me the the transfer of this big Pappa
are the saudis are saying cryptid packin

294
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,670
I'll that wear a wire while again had
tried to put forth that password I

295
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,990
probably would have been way in a really
long time

296
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:54,850
on that not a quick password to
brute-force somewhat anyways time there

297
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:59,050
up with the user user1 certainly
interesting on this and this is

298
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:02,230
useful to think about because remember I
said like this a lot of ways or

299
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:06,179
course the problem tryna you know gets
access into single stop

300
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:11,089
I in the case a user user had wanna my
routes been hey I should try to you

301
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:14,109
I'm just you them for like dictionary
attack against

302
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:17,120
this web server I prolly woulda gotten
pretty pretty quick

303
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,120
obligate you you never know and
sometimes it's easier to go down the

304
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,860
road that you know are quick

305
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:24,890
maybe they won't be successful but at
least you know don't spin your wheels

306
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,549
more than you have to

307
00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:29,760
so the camera runs a whole web spot

308
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,760
you know the full web server but it
actually has a full web ap

309
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,250
that actually does basically everything
and more

310
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:40,049
that mobile app does for you and in fact
a lot about the mobile app to doing

311
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:44,040
is actually just proxy in fruit man's to
his back and web interface

312
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:48,110
and it's been stuff out into the aisle
asap %uh so very intelligent

313
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:52,880
I it's not like a RESTful API anything
sexy it's like hey I miss an HP call at

314
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,340
this

315
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:59,010
web app and it'll something data back
and see what happens getting back to

316
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:01,290
what consumers no verse what they don't
know

317
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:04,950
again this is not a document thing you
at no point I'm

318
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:08,230
any documentation say hey you have a web
server running on this camera

319
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:13,470
hey if you wanna login do this new US
consumer never know that

320
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:15,970
on when you login with the use user
credentials

321
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:20,970
unlike certain privilege you know level
that might see on devices like this

322
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:24,590
where they might really restricted in
that part out what you can do

323
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:28,429
Abu user-level basically what you do any
read operation were lost

324
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:32,630
but no write operations for the most
part and in this case you can watch the

325
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:33,280
video

326
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,230
you can listen to audio you can make it
streaming video streaming images there's

327
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:39,510
actually a of Flash interface in here

328
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:43,550
I'll you can also see most interestingly
enough you can also see me

329
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:47,180
API keys for all the third-party
services that the scammers using

330
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:51,390
so even though you have this user user
login and you can't change settings on

331
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,340
the camera with it

332
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:56,209
you can get the API keys to which you
can then just communicate directly to

333
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,450
mister pretty services

334
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:00,940
and do whatever you want those

335
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,109
you also have for more details and
configuration for things like

336
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:07,158
on motion alarms and sound alarms

337
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:10,680
I think that which is up

338
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:17,130
Ari go perfect with you

339
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:21,240
within that sweet by access that you
have for the User user

340
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,780
you can actually do things like a dual
wireless can so I don't know about you I

341
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,840
definitely had neighbors in the past
that would put stuff like their families

342
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,570
bowl like

343
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:32,399
you know name for their street address
for their home address like crazy stuff

344
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:32,740
that

345
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:36,100
knowing he would ever do but like we all
have had neighbors that would do stuff

346
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:36,720
like that

347
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,230
I'll soul but you now playing

348
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:43,590
I guess devil's advocate in this case on
if I were

349
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:47,659
you know going on showed and looking at
a buncha cameras grammy night he's all

350
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,440
that jazz

351
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,550
on yeah of course with the type you get
a usually with by Karen daily meal

352
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:57,120
you know your location roughly on and
then let's say you have another piece of

353
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,990
data like a street address or

354
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,670
family name or something else you
actually might be a little work out

355
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:02,470
where this rule

356
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:05,670
remote camera actually is and who owns
in which house it is so

357
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:09,320
that's interesting operates more
interesting because

358
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,389
in with this user user said a
credentialed you can actually see where

359
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,030
the emotional arms are

360
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:17,590
and you can see what the sensitivity up
the audio alarms are maybe they turn off

361
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:20,189
my alarm comes with knowing her daughter
some right

362
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:24,160
ob but if I'm if I'm breaking in your
house i'd have to stay below that my

363
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:24,720
email

364
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,530
boxes there with up and the motion alarm
will never go all

365
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:31,800
so this is good in calendar to break
into someone's house and you are you can

366
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,950
see inside their house to see if maybe
someone's home or they just left or

367
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:35,610
something else

368
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:41,050
you can also in enable this beautiful
Flash interface if you're so inclined

369
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:44,480
one one thing to know i mean to scare
with a good camera the the video quality

370
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:44,900
is

371
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,040
kinda you know passable I guess at the
end of the day but the audio

372
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,790
oMG the stairway in the back is you know
I don't know twenty-some-odd

373
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:55,629
me from where the camera is and when I
was doing some the test like I could

374
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,270
hear my wife

375
00:20:56,270 --> 00:21:00,050
watching TV upstairs so audio pickups
really good which for

376
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:03,580
on you as a homeowner is a great thing
but also for criminals

377
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:08,939
an equally great thing I'm sober tonight
chart ob left side is just for more

378
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:09,730
details

379
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:14,130
on notably there's a a web interface to
actually do the firmware updates now of

380
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:14,750
course in this

381
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:19,000
in this configuration we don't have up
access to upload for more

382
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,050
up but remember that config file that we
we found the we will convict file

383
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:26,399
had the admin password so you could just
on as you know

384
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,950
talent in had out you know the the admin
password from that vial

385
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:34,970
log in as the admin June web interface
and actually just pass it the URL

386
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:38,290
up new firmware and we actually update
or you just from the web interface

387
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:41,629
a very simple process in want one thing
I

388
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:45,470
I was really out in Boston and at this I
G security about

389
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:49,010
and dangerous parking I and yes the
whole premise in

390
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:52,080
1i guess his latest you know really in
thesis is

391
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,520
I having a slight end-of-life built into
embedded devices because they're so on

392
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,010
maintainable on the whole

393
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:03,600
and you know there's also the promise
I'll how do you really verify integrity

394
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,650
up something like this ever because
you're trusting

395
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:09,650
the device to tell you that up-to-date
ortzy

396
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:12,810
or whatever the case might be so I
update firmware

397
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:17,100
on your device I can just always turn
off that it will never update for more

398
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,500
again and never override my settings so

399
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,510
once you have a device on your network
like this after you are and hopefully

400
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,670
even by time you get a

401
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:28,170
your house after you open the box and
put on your network you really can't for

402
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:30,640
sure say probably that actually secure
still

403
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,710
on which has you know some concern
implications

404
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:36,770
%uh you of people things like what ledu

405
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:40,180
highlights on an often for people out
and I'm

406
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:43,420
the bottom right pane is just some
details about the API stuff that we're

407
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:46,300
talking about earlier where you have
access to any third party services

408
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:51,440
and can see details in televisions one
of the vendors that they were using

409
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,210
I in television and I is effectively
where they're storing all

410
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:59,500
the videos for alerts so if you had a
motion or audio alert this is where that

411
00:22:59,500 --> 00:22:59,840
they

412
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,199
upload the file and television is just
using Amazon s3 on the back n

413
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,670
so one other thing I'd like to talk
about in

414
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:10,930
kinda scoping iraqi security and and US
consumers is

415
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:14,970
you know when I bought this camera and
set it up in creating my account with

416
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,850
these get with with this vendor

417
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:20,560
on I never knew that I was going to be
also up customer

418
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:24,100
up in television or these other ones
I'll talk to you about but like I didn't

419
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,780
know my dad would go to s3

420
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:29,010
you know there are some sure prolly
became and it is probably going to data

421
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:30,040
center Mike under

422
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,620
arms are just keep in mind as you're
you're buying these things and

423
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,780
transmitting data

424
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:37,080
I unless it's spelt out very very
straightforward

425
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,280
you probably don't know how many banners
on the back end are actually getting

426
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,210
your details

427
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:44,610
your date on and what happens if you're
better goes away

428
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:48,770
or that third parties you break the
contract what does that mean for them to

429
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:50,850
actually have more data anymore

430
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:53,860
%uh or you have in your date anymore

431
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:58,620
the files themselves in that in that
Amazon s3 bucket for their story and

432
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,880
out one bucket so if you're in a WS
person you know that you should

433
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,960
generally segment

434
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,540
user data out into mop bucket to not
have one giant bucket evolved a tuple

435
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:11,420
they also were doing any form access
control other than the back about

436
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:14,670
unique URL so if you ever did see the
URL

437
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:18,550
I by the way all these API calls are
clear text and all the axis

438
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:23,260
s3 was clear taxed so if you're aburto
10 on a network and you man

439
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:26,720
and the milling Starbucks you would see
all the data wind I and have always

440
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,200
access anyways

441
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,880
%ah there's no encryption done by the
camera the mobile app before this day is

442
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,460
uploaded so if you have a URL you can
download the file without

443
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:39,320
without questioners there's nothing else
you up the one below

444
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:44,230
big caveat here and on you know does the
same boilerplate

445
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:48,810
thing as every single time is I found
hardcore credentials for a.w.s

446
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:52,730
API keys in the mobile app I never
tested them because that would be a

447
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:56,250
really really obvious in blatant us yet
a violation

448
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:59,320
ob however contextually let's keep in
mind

449
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,770
one bucket all files go to that place op

450
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:06,460
I have access to the camera so I know
the camera doesn't have any additional

451
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:10,060
a blessed keys I know the mobile app
doesn't have any additional a top US

452
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:10,710
keys

453
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:14,270
so if I'm going to make you know that
happen in Burns I would say that both

454
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:18,170
he's probably rule them all and would
have probably give me access to all the

455
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:20,450
files for all users at one time

456
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:24,480
um but the company never confirmed %uh
nor denied that was the case when I told

457
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,070
them

458
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:28,740
on hands and subsequently that doesn't
work the same way

459
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:33,700
it at you stoop so hopefully they fix
some stuff in there

460
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,880
and now it's bad enough that your data

461
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,289
wouldn't be in crypt in when it's
uploaded judas third-party surfing and I

462
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:40,020
know whereof

463
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:44,090
I its all so bad that the files were
protected by access controls our

464
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:45,190
credentials at all

465
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:48,890
on but also from the mobile app remember
everything's in the model at all

466
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:52,409
I actually found that if you deleted a
file using the mobile app which is the

467
00:25:52,409 --> 00:25:53,830
only way to delete a file

468
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:58,010
I it might actually not the week while I
deleted a file from mobile app it was

469
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:01,360
there two months later I think I checked
a couple more subsequent times

470
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,970
and it's one of those things where if
you have a video that gets uploaded

471
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:06,010
accidentally

472
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:09,620
on walk to your house your dog parks in
your naked alright you're like oh that's

473
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,600
funny haha

474
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,690
I would like this video on the internet
know you might actually not the week the

475
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:14,630
beauty of the Internet

476
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:18,529
and now we are not too lenient from the
internet with your vendor

477
00:26:18,529 --> 00:26:21,919
you're not leaving it with the third
party vendor who then using another

478
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,570
third party vendor store

479
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:27,039
you have no idea that files there the
only reason I know that by always there

480
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,179
after the back is because I knew what to
look for and what you are holding 02

481
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:33,510
on and I was honestly kinda happenstance
that I even realized that

482
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:36,760
so up pretty terrifying when you think
about where your day is at hand

483
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,770
and what what else is out there that
you're unaware of who will you know who

484
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:41,590
has that

485
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:44,100
I'm UX UI see us I'll

486
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,840
they're the people that do the actual
stream in so if you're your amo anyone

487
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,600
stream the video camera to your mobile
app they're the people that actually

488
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:54,040
opera provide that service the

489
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,520
data that's being streamed and this is
where the

490
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:02,330
the web interface really comes in
importantly when you request

491
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:05,980
actually act access your camera though
the way that works

492
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:09,090
is that I'll there's Damon on

493
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:12,730
the camera that's making a connection
outbound to

494
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:15,980
on their streaming server and then your
mobile app

495
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:19,230
is contacting service provider and

496
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:23,420
all they're doing is basically proxy new
you are literally seen

497
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:27,720
this web interface affectively in your
mobile app and just have no idea

498
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,350
and it's not it's not like you're
streaming video from their server

499
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:34,660
your streaming video from your whole
literally

500
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:38,560
it's just proximate through their server
%ah so in terms of network

501
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:42,480
attacks if they have on outbound TCP
connection

502
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,860
that you have direct access to a web
server with if you can find a

503
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:48,840
multi-billion at web service without
knowing credential rendell's

504
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:53,030
you can just break-in and you know
execute code or something beyond network

505
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:56,000
in ATCO tendency with the rest the
network that this device is on

506
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,330
and a lot of hype on you know IP in

507
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:02,399
in a I embedded type devices like
cameras and similar

508
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,250
are actually going about this in a
similar way which is terrifying

509
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:11,130
I and I a more ideal way would be data
streams outbound from your network

510
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:11,630
throughout

511
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:15,300
up their party service or whatever and
then you connect to that service

512
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:18,630
and they're basically passion that data
and streaming it live

513
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:22,100
not opening a proxy connection between
your two networks

514
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,960
that's that's no bueno on you know
having at no point that

515
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,260
terminate those connections and doesn't
like him back in the other ways

516
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,930
is much better way to go

517
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:35,720
if you can see in the screenshot on by
the way I I'd regret cutting off the

518
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,160
fact that it says HDPE

519
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:40,970
so it's not a cryptic either on it has a

520
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:44,550
proxy nine that no it's not that and in
some high number port

521
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:48,440
flash mob lied I those

522
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:53,260
I those and points I you know assembly
you can a numerate those

523
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:56,600
I never tried to actually see if I can
see other peoples cameras by enumerating

524
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,310
those

525
00:28:57,310 --> 00:29:00,649
you know knock yourself out a few wanna
go down that road but

526
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:03,830
I would recommend it on its 10 things
though

527
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:07,970
you again as an end-user does you not
know that you have this

528
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:11,540
open connection for the internet to be
inside her house

529
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:15,770
like no one's told you that that's how
this works and that's frustrating and

530
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:20,040
and more frustrating as I said is its
not actually do encryption so if you are

531
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,090
at Starbucks any

532
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:24,160
are streaming your video that actually
will not

533
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:30,669
be encrypt it and someone can watch the
video along with you

534
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:32,289
one other as well now whatever

535
00:29:32,289 --> 00:29:36,379
other but a couple other aspects about
UX getting back to

536
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:39,900
password security and stuff like that
and and data transfer and who owns your

537
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,840
day and all this other stuff

538
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:44,280
on when you start to stem innovation
they would actually

539
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:47,559
yep York your password to a third party
at Ceridian

540
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:51,840
how with a third party so we talked like
hafer creatures and Twilight well you

541
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,049
like last past financial I know like if

542
00:29:54,049 --> 00:29:57,650
axe gets breach out totally just get
your that password

543
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:02,159
well a third party vendor now has your
unique password that you created for one

544
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:02,830
service

545
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:07,820
so if they get breach and you don't know
your customer of theirs

546
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:11,710
how safe are you now right so the last
past my works really well when you have

547
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:14,570
like a single pass for per service and
randomized all that

548
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:17,590
is that no one else actually use that
password for another account

549
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:20,970
happy bridge back your knowledge
hopefully obvious this

550
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:24,550
you know completely read that premise it
actually takes the

551
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:28,590
past your actual password doesn't md5
sum that password

552
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:33,050
and uses that as actually liked secret
token went through an API calls

553
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:36,320
so again if someone's on the network
with you and again all the API calls are

554
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,330
clear text they can get your md5sum
password and if they want just reports

555
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:41,169
that and start walking

556
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:44,370
in as you don't have to go through all
this like extra had a

557
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:47,500
thing just steal your password now from
workforce in a remote able in

558
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,560
and out just log into your account as if
it was you on your wall

559
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:54,530
on their old on their own mobile app um

560
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:57,560
soak up a lockable example the API call
that they were doing

561
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:01,210
about the bottom one will actually
create a token

562
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:05,340
I and then you know using that that that
mi5 password

563
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:09,290
animate open itself will come back and
you can then pass the mac address that

564
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:10,060
twice in

565
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:13,990
surgeon API calls to your heart's
content

566
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,549
up for what I did I'm

567
00:31:15,549 --> 00:31:19,320
like most people I with that showed an
but what I call did slightly different

568
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,649
than what some people might have

569
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:25,059
soon on did it's really small in terms
of the number of devices

570
00:31:25,059 --> 00:31:28,059
up for that is market share II don't I

571
00:31:28,059 --> 00:31:31,139
I know it's a lot of places and I know
it has like I really good retail

572
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:31,710
presence

573
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:34,950
however keep in mind that in order to
find these cameras

574
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:38,120
you would have to basically be port
forwarding or have no firewall or

575
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:41,500
you know some other combination that
allows you to see helmet on the internet

576
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:41,950
which is

577
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:45,690
on kinda kinda weird however the other
thing I did

578
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:50,179
is not look at she peed which probably
would have been a little bit more likely

579
00:31:50,179 --> 00:31:51,240
to be on the network

580
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:56,110
there was really no consistent unique
signature for the HTTP Server

581
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:59,860
I felt really confident about so I took
the thing I thought most confident about

582
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:02,750
which was told that because the telnet
banner was very unique

583
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:06,299
obsolete I had a higher you know hi sure
that that was a

584
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:09,389
a positive and not a false one I'll

585
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:14,309
its you know again this is from July
2013 why when I was doing actual

586
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:15,139
research so

587
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:19,070
on you know who knows what the numbers
now and like I said if you did HDPE and

588
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,189
can verify

589
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:23,480
with some you know it really want to
give your data without actually

590
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,660
walking into people's you know networks
which is a bad idea

591
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:31,400
I'll you know could be a much bigger
number now so which was wise

592
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,150
you know we have access all the stuff
the only thing I didn't ask what I was

593
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:35,820
doing this was all abilities

594
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,980
like actually finally is this and again
like they're a lot of the Japs are

595
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:41,850
probably worse than all but attacks in
smaller cities and stop

596
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:45,570
that would work but I'll in the case you
start with route

597
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:49,418
and you have for more like public access
your like funny bone ability is kinda

598
00:32:49,419 --> 00:32:52,600
not necessary at that point I might be
interesting but

599
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:57,309
I was kinda looking for big ticket stuff
so he was kinda quick synopsis have all

600
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:59,870
these issues out I think we talked all
these

601
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:04,929
at some point I'll keep in mind this is
one IP camera this is one internet

602
00:33:04,929 --> 00:33:06,960
things as one embedded device under
network

603
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,299
and with how many Boehner bilities and
how many service you know failures and

604
00:33:10,299 --> 00:33:12,740
third parties and all this other stuff
cornball

605
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,890
and if you think of how many devices the
next year's gonna be fine

606
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:19,429
and putting on your network you know
your nest or you know your TiVo search

607
00:33:19,429 --> 00:33:22,990
all these different devices that are all
you know network-enabled and

608
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:26,700
have something better hardware you know
action going on some links and all this

609
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,309
other stuff

610
00:33:27,309 --> 00:33:31,820
I each one of those is a target for bad
bad stuff like this to happen

611
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:34,990
and thinking about what your I'll you
know

612
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:38,059
how much risk you really wanna take
because honestly a lot of people are

613
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:40,530
bringing stuff just like this into their
offices

614
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:43,379
right you want to keep IP camera to
bring your office and put on your

615
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,480
network and maybe

616
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,940
maybe your eye you know health care
provider now on our health care provider

617
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:50,250
with a camera that has all these
vulnerabilities

618
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:53,840
and you know in terms of hip-hop despite
not gonna go over very well

619
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,990
people

620
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:58,720
um in I in terms of the

621
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,930
research subsequent I will talk about
disclosure in a second but

622
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:06,830
other some still room to do some other
stuff on this camera if you're so

623
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:07,360
inclined

624
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:11,040
a number one of course plenty more
bodies in the actual aP's on the camera

625
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,909
on remember that a lot of the code on
those cameras are actually the third

626
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:17,649
party vendors code to actually run their
games and stuff

627
00:34:17,649 --> 00:34:21,679
so I'm it's kind of a bigger bigger
scope than just the camera itself but

628
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,330
could be interesting on doing custom
firmware do you know doing

629
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:28,750
money hack spring-like you know I had on
someone when they walk

630
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:31,899
fire something there's there's lottery
there if you're if you're awesome

631
00:34:31,899 --> 00:34:35,819
plan to do that kinda stuff on and API's
I really don't look too hard at

632
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:39,600
I'll mostly cuz most the API testing
would have had to you

633
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,409
involved things up I would've been
mostly legal so it seem like a bad word

634
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:44,409
to go down as well

635
00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:46,790
on

636
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:49,859
now in terms of what the FTC thinks
about stuff like this

637
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:53,940
if you ever heard about the train a case
where actively there was one ability

638
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:58,480
I it was really gnarly in that you can
just go to you a URL and get direct

639
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,030
access to IP cameras

640
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:03,150
up someone cradle was about 700 or so
these cameras

641
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:07,220
put them online people start you know
putting the right for ten dollars or

642
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,010
stop

643
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:11,470
and I got the attention of water news
agencies which in turn got the attention

644
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:12,630
FTC

645
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:15,730
I and subsequently kinda got some pretty
pretty having

646
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:18,430
restrictions and some other action
against them because of their failure

647
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:19,160
for security

648
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,200
which is good you know people should be
out you know

649
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,849
somewhat chastised for huge failures
like that with first with regard to

650
00:35:25,849 --> 00:35:29,030
the privacy and safety if so many people
on now

651
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:32,940
in terms of the language what are the
restrictions was the FTC said that

652
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:35,250
marking materials train that couldn't
use the

653
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:39,869
you know affectively the phrase said you
know this is secure or the camera secure

654
00:35:39,869 --> 00:35:40,810
security or

655
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:45,328
any of those kinda Bob offshoots and we
look at the eyes on what saying this is

656
00:35:45,329 --> 00:35:49,790
again a little bit old now I'll that one
side course at secure bank security

657
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:52,750
group military all that you know all the
kinda markings that you guys see all the

658
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:53,300
time

659
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:56,589
on now I would contend that in terms of
what

660
00:35:56,589 --> 00:36:02,029
trying it did wrong is like very pop
like it pales in comparison

661
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:05,270
need to how much bad stuff them in a
patient in their camera like

662
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:08,400
complete pillars obscurity up again I
didn't like

663
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,410
try to put some other people's lives in
danger so I I guess and make not news

664
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:17,420
disclosure time-line pretty quick time
line I actually had some it this

665
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,160
research

666
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,348
I to public conferences so I have a
click up for mandate when this research

667
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:23,770
would be released unless someone

668
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:26,690
directly asked me to you know redact
something our whole back something or

669
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:27,440
whatever else

670
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,790
which I'm always happy to you you know
do for company up there

671
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:35,020
acting right way about things but on for
my very first may I said

672
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:38,849
you know I have some security issues
with the camera I'd like to cure

673
00:36:38,849 --> 00:36:41,890
you know seniors engineering personal
wealth can talk about these pens

674
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:44,960
issues just so you know I'm gonna be
releasing his research

675
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,130
in October so since email number one
they knew that that was like

676
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:52,569
basically the Andy up through all my
weird emailed

677
00:36:52,569 --> 00:36:56,339
exchanges and many of them are very
weird I really have

678
00:36:56,339 --> 00:37:00,150
pretty much nowhere until the 14 about
October

679
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:03,470
when they kinda pipe backup and

680
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:06,740
I was asked to like have a conversation
with them and talk about like all these

681
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,150
issues that I found

682
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:12,349
on Abe said like oh and your research is
wrong in this isn't right and

683
00:37:12,349 --> 00:37:16,400
something something whatever else and
who you know I'm a pretty

684
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,460
your humble guy so if you say like the
researchers wrong like I'd love to you

685
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,170
know what got

686
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:23,410
what what went wrong but keep in mind I
have like

687
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:27,109
screenshot by has two things I've seen
results like I can confirm that date i

688
00:37:27,109 --> 00:37:30,578
deleted still there I can confirm that
the root password is hardcoded

689
00:37:30,579 --> 00:37:34,150
into all your cameras like that's a very
simple thing to do on

690
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:36,869
sewing I you know I think it might've
been a little bit more posturing on

691
00:37:36,869 --> 00:37:37,319
their

692
00:37:37,319 --> 00:37:41,050
their side than anything of it why did
offer to meet up and talk and all this

693
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:41,770
other stuff

694
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:45,250
they never got back to me and still have
never gotten back to me so

695
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:48,650
oh well I'll good news is

696
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:53,599
as far as I'm aware up all the major
vulnerability is our passion

697
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:57,060
radiated mitigated or some other you
know some other way on

698
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:00,259
fixed I don't use the camera myself
anymore I

699
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:04,030
on a different camera from a much better
better for security

700
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:08,589
and you know so it's you know it's kind
of the way that most things going

701
00:38:08,589 --> 00:38:11,990
put some time and try to get some
results usually results don't come out

702
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:12,950
until

703
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:16,210
way after your foster with the vendor
because they've stopped talking your

704
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:19,760
threaten your are also up to keep in
mind

705
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,160
no wifi thermostat switch you know
nothing stopped by I think he will

706
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,250
actually have their own kind

707
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:28,190
just like thing coming up very soon our
cameras and and like all these cool

708
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:30,150
things that we have better internet
enabled her

709
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:33,760
you know some way or another I'm keep in
mind if that device communicates

710
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,440
out your network I'll maybe it's reverse
proxy

711
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,740
you know who knows right are you have to
verify that your cell

712
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:44,260
maybe it has hardcore passwords how do
you know dumping firmware going to

713
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:44,930
mobile app's

714
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:48,759
you know this is stuff that can as
consumers you have really no insight

715
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,540
into what most people like me or someone
else in the room does research

716
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:55,259
tell you about the things that are on
your device arms I I would I would

717
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,260
encourage you to look at devices like
this

718
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:00,710
on certainly don't you know attack
network services out outlook

719
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:04,040
our scope your network but if you have a
network device in your running you know

720
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,160
are short on your home network and you
but the hardware and stuff like that

721
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,690
oMG you know read reasonably assured
that you will get in too much trouble

722
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:15,150
on now certainly II I would talk to the
vendor me very kind and your choice the

723
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,520
tree is the people that you're working
with

724
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,710
for security research because lawsuits
are very easy for big companies that

725
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:20,390
brought you

726
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:26,240
to keep that in mind as well but on
stiller from Raspberry Pi I know they're

727
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,970
I just complete stop caring and I'm
rubble talking like a year now I still

728
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:31,140
don't know where that thing is

729
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:34,348
but obvious with a much more interesting
project in like the like

730
00:39:34,349 --> 00:39:37,890
I don't know the housing you that thing
for a cat internet server something

731
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:40,920
on so it's a quick shout out sobbing

732
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,569
about the focal White Plains over with
us now to us we saw him away but

733
00:39:44,569 --> 00:39:49,160
II about lab guy like me user cluster
for password cracking to get that one

734
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,140
not

735
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:53,348
I admin passwords on at the brown by CP
for that

736
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:58,069
on John oh and Adam it do offer some
guidance from stop and then my body I

737
00:39:58,069 --> 00:40:02,089
martínez at do actually what use is
jailbroken iPhone I love how the

738
00:40:02,089 --> 00:40:06,078
one jailbroken iPhone we had a security
company will along through the video

739
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:06,740
editing

740
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:10,000
guy at our company like I'll we'll

741
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,270
subsequently bought our own jailbroken
iPhone for testing

742
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:18,400
so I'll so contact details you know
please reach out to me I

743
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,339
I'm I'm sure he'll guys who had
recording after the fact if you like

744
00:40:21,339 --> 00:40:21,680
having

745
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:26,299
double back but on slider speak redact
my personal website on a calm has a

746
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:28,390
bunch of other street you know dachshund

747
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:32,529
other cool stuff I and then I in terms
of I guess time

748
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:35,670
actually finish pretty early are 5-10
minutes for questions

749
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:38,859
if we don't need that will check out
early and get it for beer but any any

750
00:40:38,859 --> 00:40:42,310
questions yes

751
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:49,310
that yet

752
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:52,250
it's a good question for the question
being I did I have a conversation with

753
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:52,840
the vendor

754
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:57,410
a voice actual or course otherwise on
all my conversations were the email

755
00:40:57,410 --> 00:41:01,000
I every time I try to I give my phone
number and say hey let's have a collar

756
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,420
or

757
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:04,550
is there a number i can reach you at %ah
they either declined

758
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:08,210
and said that they're working on stuff
and they didn't wanna talk quite yet

759
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:10,780
or are we just never got to the point
where they actually would give me

760
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,930
contact details

761
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:15,069
that we actually get to someone
important on their help desk

762
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:18,810
and their I would say their support
staff was actually really responsive at

763
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:19,290
first

764
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:22,890
way more make way more responsive than
the actual leadership the company which

765
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:23,839
is kinda concerning

766
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:28,890
on but again virtually never actually
got her message with those guys

767
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:34,129
with your question yeah ho

768
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:37,550
sure yes I might as well I might as well
actually since I have like a couple

769
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:38,340
quick minutes

770
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:41,830
um and of course on that actual life by

771
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:45,600
well so what's circles the wifi

772
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:52,600
password start but

773
00:41:53,350 --> 00:42:00,350
bought go II

774
00:42:11,269 --> 00:42:15,519
okay there oh yeah

775
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:22,519
on a look make them good sure just

776
00:42:23,869 --> 00:42:30,869
your any

777
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:38,589
so that mostly put some screen area

778
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:42,240
on so I I

779
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,680
aside another I would you research %uh
since then and you know I'm

780
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,848
have gotten down this road a little bit
more and the same kinda problems kept

781
00:42:49,849 --> 00:42:52,440
creeping up which is no different in a
lot of the research

782
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,519
they that you guys might be doing but on
you know the last

783
00:42:55,519 --> 00:42:59,339
the classroom research I did actual
really really poorly in terms of legal

784
00:42:59,339 --> 00:43:04,099
rats and other bad stuff and %ah so on
myself and then not exactly you're

785
00:43:04,099 --> 00:43:05,710
already mine owners Quine

786
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:09,180
on we decide to start initiative called
built securely

787
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:12,240
and affect Lee we're doing two things
not number one

788
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,980
is we're organizing our resources for
engineering staff so if you can read

789
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:17,359
like

790
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:21,380
1i West security paper one REST API
slide deck or something else

791
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:24,650
out you know you can point people here
and hopefully get some decent resources

792
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:25,950
that are actually useful

793
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:29,779
and watch the help out build securely
you know buildings more securely than

794
00:43:29,779 --> 00:43:33,480
must be bored doing now on so education
one part on

795
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:37,390
part number two is we also are doing

796
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:41,868
%uh you know basie pro bono security
research like

797
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:46,410
most was due anyways right %ah 4 vendors
that are small commercial

798
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:50,308
which wraps I'll you know low funded
organization because

799
00:43:50,309 --> 00:43:53,480
reality is a lot of companies are making
I O two devices right now

800
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,559
you have never heard of they're not
Samsung they're not just go there not

801
00:43:56,559 --> 00:43:57,259
Belkin

802
00:43:57,259 --> 00:44:00,789
mostly out here by since coming to the
market are very small organizations

803
00:44:00,789 --> 00:44:02,740
trying to get like a little piece of
that pie because

804
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:07,180
you think of something like ard are like
Arduino a Raspberry Pi or or gum sticks

805
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:08,970
are all these different like small
platforms

806
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:12,269
very easy to build very easy to do

807
00:44:12,269 --> 00:44:16,029
yard to play some software on you have a
free printer you make a case for it like

808
00:44:16,029 --> 00:44:17,309
you have ninety device

809
00:44:17,309 --> 00:44:21,589
like it's very very easy on so what
we're doing is we're pairing up security

810
00:44:21,589 --> 00:44:22,500
researchers from

811
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:26,029
honestly some a passenger researchers in
the world with NCC group we have I

812
00:44:26,029 --> 00:44:27,660
lacked there we exhibitor

813
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:31,848
all these all these organizations have
have paired up with us and Dom

814
00:44:31,849 --> 00:44:36,259
affect the world with but crowd give
mean vendors a direct line

815
00:44:36,259 --> 00:44:39,910
to researchers to then hopefully and
most cases

816
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:43,680
do pre-production security testing so
before you go to market with you I would

817
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,250
you device

818
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:47,890
these researchers will test it give you
bugs for free

819
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:50,990
maybe you can help it may be given
teacher like on the harpies is a party

820
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:52,960
or something like whatever just to say
thanks but

821
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:58,210
on affectively make it so it not me
testing hardware that I bought that i

822
00:44:58,210 --> 00:44:59,349
won tested

823
00:44:59,349 --> 00:45:03,279
were flipping kinda the script and
making it so vendors are opting in

824
00:45:03,279 --> 00:45:07,640
you having people research and do their
devices so really the benefit to the

825
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:08,328
researchers

826
00:45:08,329 --> 00:45:12,150
is basic to talk about the research they
get to go to conferences like this

827
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:15,420
not be threatened with legal action not
be threatened with the Indies

828
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,200
and actually come and talk about the
same important learning that I just

829
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,690
talked with you guys about today

830
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:22,759
on so that's what we're up to build
securely and

831
00:45:22,759 --> 00:45:25,960
to the long long roundabout answer is I
drop cam

832
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:29,630
so drop cam is really local company I
actually without

833
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:33,660
San Francisco during our essay of sat
down with the engineering staff gave

834
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:36,618
this slide deck and another slide deck
by iraqi security

835
00:45:36,619 --> 00:45:40,730
on they have a great security page they
have a great bounty program

836
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:44,319
for public stuff there one of our first
partners for bill that securely that

837
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,339
some new product coming out soon that
we're gonna get

838
00:45:46,339 --> 00:45:49,750
access to have when it releases

839
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:53,349
so that hopefully by the time and and
this is really the goal hopefully by the

840
00:45:53,349 --> 00:45:54,049
time

841
00:45:54,049 --> 00:45:58,309
products come to market they have been
researched and looked at and reviewed

842
00:45:58,309 --> 00:46:01,420
and patched rather than you guys buying
10,000 units

843
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:05,309
and having to try to patch the after the
fact so that's where ru up to

844
00:46:05,309 --> 00:46:08,740
om its sides it's gone very well we
started in February

845
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:13,420
were actually just about to put art
where researchers hand from Pinocchio

846
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:16,490
which is a system-on-chip that's
actually based I'm Michigan

847
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:20,079
and then drop can have some stuff coming
in July for us are so it's it's been

848
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:21,640
successful we actually have

849
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:24,910
you know them like a really good Cheryl
amazing people wait way smarter than I

850
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:25,480
am

851
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:28,920
on and work you know we're going down
the right path to hopefully

852
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:33,000
not probably change security for OT but
certainly help from the smaller brands

853
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,359
and make it a little bit more

854
00:46:34,359 --> 00:46:38,038
easy to %uh get get the assistance to
get to market more securely

855
00:46:38,039 --> 00:46:42,039
and hopefully I can snowballs a little
bit me see what happens so

856
00:46:42,039 --> 00:46:45,670
sorry for taking a to any time any any
other questions yet

857
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:51,170
um

858
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:55,450
know this research at honestly a lot I O
T stuff you can get away with with like

859
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:59,829
you know ob shit at our cap in Wireshark

860
00:46:59,829 --> 00:47:02,890
I mean for all the network's top right
on you know I

861
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:07,520
if you want to be more them the a the I
west of

862
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:11,180
again like you know having I'd uproar
something or hopper to do some the

863
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:14,359
analysis of the actual mobile images is
useful

864
00:47:14,359 --> 00:47:17,359
if I'm going to the hardware stuff by
you know you buy one

865
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:21,680
%ah some hardware like a tag that's
available or like a logic analyzer

866
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:26,230
I'll but I yeah most most the work I'm
honestly I as guess I like

867
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:30,260
estimates got real nothing everything
kinda class for down

868
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:33,480
I want you can see inside the black box:
it's not

869
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:37,270
not so much a mystery any more yeah

870
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:39,870
yeah I wish I could say this a lot like
harder to do but that's why I'm

871
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:42,930
encouraging you guys like bison I G
proper just a very own

872
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:46,109
look at it because honestly all have at
least the research stuff to get some

873
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:48,150
free tickets the conference's worst case
rates up

874
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:52,230
not the worst of course we live on but
it means beneficially think I'd like

875
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:53,490
that IP camera

876
00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:57,670
they fix always wonder bilities I
granted like I had a camera but actually

877
00:47:57,670 --> 00:47:58,030
have a

878
00:47:58,030 --> 00:48:01,060
had also bought this camera my brother
who has through like

879
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:04,330
six-month-old twins like I really want
some creepy person

880
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:08,140
looking at my nephews like from a camera
on the Internet no absolutely not so

881
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:11,420
it doesn't just have to be like cool
hacker research project like its

882
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:14,750
or and altruism what you want to help
people that can help themselves want to

883
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:16,500
tell people that they were in danger

884
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:19,950
going to get things patch that people
are you know pain are thirty dollars for

885
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:20,220
the

886
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:23,440
you have basic security on you know
there's there's a lot of good that we

887
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,210
can do in the community and certainly
other

888
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:28,240
you know package for charity in but code
all the other endeavors

889
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:32,190
%uh certainly had a much more primal you
know benefit but at the end the day

890
00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:35,680
likes safety and privacy of I'll
citizens of our country is

891
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:40,210
also pretty damn good wasting your time
so yeah I really doing for you guys do

892
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:41,620
some these private security not

893
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:44,620
on healthier your flight Dixon future
events

894
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:49,390
any I the last question cool

895
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:56,390
Thank You upstart the oh yes oh we
actually out weekly

896
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:10,910
we coordinate with the job that the PR
teams and everything else

897
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:14,250
at these at these places on I'll
actually be giving up

898
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:17,250
on Pocket Def Con on harshly about this

899
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:20,540
and partially about more I O T stuff and
%ah

900
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:23,210
we're hoping just just before that to
have some kind of announcements and

901
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,550
stuff go out publicly in

902
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:29,440
week we've had a captain community-based
right now because we're still trying

903
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,100
like you know the one thing that
frustrates me as someone that's been is

904
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:33,370
industry a while

905
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:36,470
when people start a project or
initiative like this and then say like

906
00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:39,780
our to be like huge in the past and you
know I thousand people to join us right

907
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:40,410
now

908
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:44,299
and then it goes nowhere we've grown
really really slowly with people that we

909
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:45,340
trust me know

910
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:49,750
have credibility and on we want to do
things the right way not the quick way

911
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:53,420
and so Bob you know by by Def Con time
we should have some cool

912
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:56,650
news about like you know developer our
researchers looking at are like that

913
00:49:56,650 --> 00:49:59,980
on your pipe in our press release up
with some these companies like NCC group

914
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:00,790
I'll active

915
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:04,830
Dropcam Nokia and so on and so forth ob
that makes them look good

916
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:09,060
to write like they're the only IP camera
vendor are paid right so if you combine

917
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:11,759
IP camera and you care about security

918
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,060
here's a great in a reference point for
that we're gonna buy system-on-chip

919
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:18,670
and you want to use up with that on you
to look at Nokia right because they care

920
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:19,910
about security and

921
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:22,940
so that's kinda peer pressure thing I'm
hoping for a hoping that

922
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:26,190
we get enough better than enough spaces
that when work you know

923
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:29,850
keyboard but you guys are giving out
recommendations on what what IP camera

924
00:50:29,850 --> 00:50:30,500
shy by

925
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:33,950
I I would hope you'd say something like
dropped out because you know that their

926
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:37,330
their sirs but security on and up
they're working with both securely like

927
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:39,880
that's that's a good recommendation to
make at that point so

928
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:42,990
om that's you know I think I think it's
a beneficial everyone like there's no

929
00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:44,620
one that really loses in the scenario

930
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:47,850
researchers gonna do research in after
about legal bullshit and get a

931
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:52,500
Depok on a crowd gets a huge reputation
because because they're

932
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:56,890
doing all this for free for us are our
researchers individually get there

933
00:50:56,890 --> 00:51:00,799
credit for doing the work the companies
that employ those researchers get credit

934
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:01,890
for wanting to do the work

935
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:04,750
and then of course the vendors get good
credit for being security-conscious

936
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:05,550
vendors

937
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:09,200
so on you know you really find out
opportunities with so much

938
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:13,940
upside to it and out pretty cool to be a
part of so great

939
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:15,610
thanks so much guys and redress the
conference
