unique a piece by the way

95
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,219
arm 337 unique on abilities which
discovered bases bypass least Internet

96
00:07:23,219 --> 00:07:23,919

yes we got about 30 to counteract the
gym it comments so many packets

100
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:40,110
so many packets I here's the account
listing everything's anonymized however

101
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,690
if you do sears up up there you might
wanna change your passwords

102
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:46,900
humper cost is exactly how the actions
of the network traffic her over the last

103
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,460
three days

104
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,759
I'm very entertaining can see when
people will start to go through talks

105
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:52,289
and they got bored is a nephew

106
00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:56,818
traffic goes up everything um we do see
a lot of people out there

107
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:00,830
on news reporting out there's actually a
passive we didn't execute is getting so

108
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:04,419
I you know a lot people still run all
service of work

109
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:07,889
and even hackers don't patch on those

110
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:11,039
with the the person's actual running
Android 2.2+ you might want to get a new

111
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:11,539
phone

112
00:08:11,539 --> 00:08:16,279
arm now as for images

113
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:19,870
it was most innocuous out about one in
nine was actually born arm though the

114
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,860
point we did see was very entertaining

115
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:25,270
we had summer point live action tentacle
porn cream corn points in a few

116
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:28,899
live-action we actually we actually had
a big concern there

117
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:32,059
I we saw like a whole bunch of Brega
tentacle porn and then it switched over

118
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,500
to live action for about three hundred
image in switch back over

119
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,000
