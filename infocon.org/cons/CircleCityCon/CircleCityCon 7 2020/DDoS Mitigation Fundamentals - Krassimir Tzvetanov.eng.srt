1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,100
my name is Chris Minnesota and I am a

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:08,219
graduate student at Purdue University

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:12,530
and I also am a research assistant at

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:15,440
the cyber tap program which provides

5
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:21,000
technology assistance to businesses

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:24,090
around the state of Indiana you can get

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,939
in touch with me if you email me at one

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:29,189
of those two emails and if you need more

9
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:36,809
information about me this is my LinkedIn

10
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:38,430
profile okay so let's see if we can make

11
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:40,230
this a little bit more interactive

12
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,739
despite the fact that we are dealing

13
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:45,959
with online and online presentation and

14
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:49,260
discord so if you have any questions

15
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,809
please send them in the in the discord

16
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:55,140
channel for the track and I would try to

17
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:59,640
incorporate the answers is as weak as I

18
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:04,049
go and so I hope that that is coming

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:06,510
through here okay so this is also a

20
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,610
class that I normally teach over a

21
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:11,400
couple of days so here I have taken

22
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,740
excerpts from some of the kind of

23
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,720
highlights who cover a cup of attacks

24
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:20,570
how they work actually more than couple

25
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:23,100
but then we're going to also look at how

26
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:26,309
to mitigate on system level using

27
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,679
external providers and so on and also

28
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:32,070
we'll look at some of the motivation for

29
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,990
attackers and how why they organize

30
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:36,809
those attacks and what capabilities they

31
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:43,649
have again if you have any questions

32
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:47,790
please send them in the discord chat ok

33
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:49,079
cool so we see in our sillies that's

34
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,060
kind of a question I want to ask you

35
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:54,619
just wanna see the level of engagement

36
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:57,799
and also what people have as a concept

37
00:01:54,619 --> 00:01:57,799
for this

38
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:23,910
okay I pour just one second because I'm

39
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:25,680
having a discord problem I just not know

40
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:29,160
if it back there okay so anyway so did

41
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:33,630
absolutely dinner service is basically a

42
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:36,959
resource exhaustion which is a result

43
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:38,760
leads to a lack of availability there's

44
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,190
a common misconception that you know

45
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:46,370
service is a lot of traffic over a pipe

46
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:48,569
and yes this is partially true but

47
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:51,060
dinner service does not need to be

48
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:54,208
represented as our traffic over a pipe

49
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:57,269
as a matter of fact some of the really

50
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:59,100
good attacks would result in very little

51
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:01,350
amount of traffic on the pipe end to be

52
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:05,280
very difficult to detect those just

53
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:09,090
using monitoring of SNMP counters on the

54
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,610
interfaces now another thing also to

55
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:13,320
consider is a source exhaustion leading

56
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:16,500
to lack of availability now how is that

57
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:20,519
different from a website being

58
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:24,329
overloaded so things look very similar

59
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:28,019
in many cases in the way that they

60
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:30,530
manifest to the end-user so keep that in

61
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:33,570
mind because the way we deal with

62
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:34,950
overall at websites is also a potential

63
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:36,870
way we can deal with you know service

64
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:39,420
attacks just adding more capacity in a

65
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:41,100
smart way by figuring out where the

66
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:45,089
bottlenecks are just the way you would

67
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:48,930
optimize a website to be able to deal

68
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:50,609
with more traffic okay so from security

69
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,900
point of view from operations point of

70
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:53,790
view from business point of view

71
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,250
dinner service looks slightly

72
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:59,548
differently and this is somewhat

73
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:02,640
important because we have different

74
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:05,359
players here one of them is the security

75
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,279
team which usually is a small player in

76
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:10,500
in that space then the bigger player

77
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,989
would actually be the business but from

78
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,480
security point of view if we look at the

79
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:17,250
CIA tired

80
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,469
we have confidentiality integrity

81
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:23,610
availability so this is affecting the

82
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:24,960
availability component many people in

83
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,420
the security field focus on

84
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,820
confidentiality and some on integrity

85
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:32,610
but availability is usually ignored so

86
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:35,420
again DDoS is a security event for which

87
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:38,940
usually deserves the availability

88
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:40,530
component from operations point of view

89
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,540
so those would be the network

90
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,919
administrator system administrators from

91
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:46,020
their point of view this is going to be

92
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,420
just an outage and why is that

93
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:51,719
interesting because those people know

94
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:54,090
how to do with deal with outages most of

95
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,550
the people that operate large networks

96
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:59,489
have certain level of redundancy so

97
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:01,830
there is there are good ways to leverage

98
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:04,669
your redundancy balance traffic in order

99
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:07,320
to be able to accommodate larger attacks

100
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:09,780
from business point of view it's a

101
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:12,659
matter of financial losses and why is

102
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:16,349
that important well if you want to

103
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:18,840
procure equipment or additional

104
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:20,790
bandwidth or personnel to help you your

105
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,190
company deal with in our service attacks

106
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:26,640
you need to be able to demonstrate value

107
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:29,910
and the business people will be looking

108
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:33,330
at those money that they have to spend

109
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:36,540
as an offset of losses that they will

110
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:39,090
incur so if you know that your website

111
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:43,380
will suffer ten million dollars loss

112
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:46,590
over 24 period 24 hour period if it is

113
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:49,830
down then you can very easily make a

114
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:52,739
case that there's certain probability of

115
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:55,289
you being attacked and to your current

116
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,240
bandwidth maybe or current posture will

117
00:05:55,290 --> 00:06:00,479
allow you to extend the tax below

118
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:03,990
certain level but then if it is above

119
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:06,180
certain level you'll be offline so you

120
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:08,669
can say web using losing ten million

121
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:11,520
dollars a day and the probability is X

122
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:13,950
that means that maybe you can ask for

123
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:17,250
you know ten twenty percent or whatever

124
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:18,840
it is in terms of investment for

125
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:22,140
mitigation you can also think of it as

126
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,210
an insurance policy you basic or the way

127
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:28,438
you buy an insurance policy you pay

128
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:33,688
certain premium and it helps you in the

129
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:35,899
of particular type of loss any questions

130
00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:35,899
so far

131
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:44,550
okay so just quick dissemination between

132
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:46,169
terms dinner series versus distributed

133
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:49,649
in a series I think to most people this

134
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:51,089
is free obvious so in the case of dinner

135
00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:53,159
service attack we usually have one

136
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:55,080
source of the attack that sends traffic

137
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:58,199
to the target in the case of

138
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:01,198
distributing a service attack we used to

139
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,939
see usually botnets employed to do that

140
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,629
so the attacker would issue a comment to

141
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:08,369
the command and control server and then

142
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:13,469
the command and control server would

143
00:07:08,369 --> 00:07:15,839
talk to a botnet which would execute the

144
00:07:13,469 --> 00:07:17,489
attack or deliver the attack traffic so

145
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:19,110
here basically can see that the

146
00:07:17,489 --> 00:07:20,638
difference between enough service and

147
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:23,099
distributed in a service is that you

148
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,749
have multiple sources of traffic now

149
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:27,509
things became a little bit confusing

150
00:07:24,749 --> 00:07:29,939
about five years ago when a reflection

151
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:33,709
became very popular actually know that I

152
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:36,240
think about this six seven years now so

153
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:37,619
with the reflectors we don't have a

154
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,300
command and control server we don't have

155
00:07:37,619 --> 00:07:41,550
a botnet we have a bunch of reflectors

156
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,139
and those reflectors would be the

157
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:47,189
parties that are going to be delivering

158
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:49,679
the attack traffic to the target and how

159
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:51,209
this works we're going to see in a few

160
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:55,049
minutes when we look at the reflective

161
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:57,149
attacks so anyway just bottom line the

162
00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:00,269
announced services that usually you have

163
00:07:57,149 --> 00:08:02,009
one target one one attack traffic

164
00:08:00,269 --> 00:08:04,219
generator when distributed in our

165
00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:07,319
service attacks you have multiple

166
00:08:04,219 --> 00:08:09,239
generators now this also should not be

167
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:11,309
confused with somebody spoofing IP

168
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:13,078
addresses during the attack when there

169
00:08:11,309 --> 00:08:15,749
is only one attacker and their spoofing

170
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:18,300
the IP address within the packet and

171
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:20,339
then on the receiving end it looks like

172
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:25,979
it's multiple IP addresses that would

173
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:28,679
not be DDoS okay so first looking at

174
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:33,419
volume factors why is DDoS growing why

175
00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:35,578
do we get our blog post with bigger and

176
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:37,889
bigger numbers how this company or that

177
00:08:35,578 --> 00:08:40,708
other company mitigated bigger and

178
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:41,630
bigger and attack and does that really

179
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:45,079
matter

180
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:48,110
is that really relevant well let's look

181
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:52,279
at this first first factor would be

182
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:54,620
overall bandwidth so the Internet is

183
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:58,610
growing and the individual links are

184
00:08:54,620 --> 00:09:00,740
doubling in size approximately every two

185
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:05,180
years it's a little bit delayed it's not

186
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:08,509
exactly Moore's law here but if today I

187
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:11,089
have the ability to execute an attack

188
00:09:08,509 --> 00:09:14,209
that would be 20 gigabits or let's say

189
00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:16,759
30 gigabits but I can only transfer 20

190
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:20,209
gigabits out of this attack that means

191
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:23,839
that the medium is limiting me to this

192
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:25,339
amount of attack traffic two years later

193
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,500
I will probably be able to easily

194
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:29,180
transport out of the same location that

195
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,709
I'll be generating the traffic 40

196
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:33,469
gigabits that means that I can deliver

197
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:35,268
more attack traffic so if we extrapolate

198
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:37,339
this to the entire network the network

199
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:40,160
has more overall bandwidth and it can

200
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:41,269
carry more attack traffic now also if

201
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,759
you look at it from a different angle

202
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:47,240
the network itself is a filter so if you

203
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:49,279
have been a botnet or general or

204
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:52,839
generating surface that may be

205
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:55,459
reflectors for example robots that are

206
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:58,180
not well distributed around the internet

207
00:09:55,459 --> 00:10:00,859
and for example are behind slow links

208
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:03,019
that may also impede the ability for

209
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:05,089
attack traffic to be delivered to the

210
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:07,430
target no matter how much traffic is

211
00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:09,620
actually generated think about something

212
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:12,829
that is let's if you have a large botnet

213
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:14,240
behind the Great China firewall and you

214
00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:18,500
want to attack something outside of the

215
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:20,630
firewall well good luck so overall

216
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:23,990
bandwidth one of the factors or words in

217
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:26,269
bigger and bigger attacks the next

218
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:28,959
factor is reflectors we're going to

219
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:32,480
cover this in a little bit more details

220
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:36,979
and then we have IOT embedded devices

221
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:38,810
and so-called soho devices look in more

222
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:41,360
details in those in a second and the

223
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:44,329
last few things are content management

224
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:47,149
systems the so called booter or special

225
00:10:44,329 --> 00:10:48,859
services and there is also a war of

226
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:51,439
available information on this topic

227
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:53,240
nowadays twenty years ago it was very

228
00:10:51,439 --> 00:10:55,250
difficult to get a simple going because

229
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,750
it was difficult to find

230
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,610
the tools and even if you found the

231
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:00,410
tools they would normally come with

232
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:03,290
errors in them so we had to know if I'd

233
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:09,350
be able to fix them and so on

234
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:11,959
now all information is fairly they were

235
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:17,209
born so even kids in high school can

236
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:18,589
very easily set up capability and this

237
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:21,859
will kind of come into play into the

238
00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:23,959
booters and stressors now one final

239
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:26,750
thought here on this slide the overall

240
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:30,459
bandwidth as I said so if we had an

241
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:33,980
attack that is 600 gigabits per second

242
00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:36,290
and this was six years ago that would

243
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:40,310
have been quite a bit of a thing but now

244
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:41,509
600 gig is not that bad and again this

245
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,949
is because there's more overall

246
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:44,540
bandwidth so this is what I'm saying is

247
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:46,490
that the number of the absolute number

248
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:48,500
of the attack doesn't matter that much

249
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:51,620
just because those numbers are going to

250
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:54,160
be growing increasingly just because the

251
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:58,310
bandwidth available bandwidth is growing

252
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,930
okay so home routers IOT devices

253
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:01,309
the major problem there is that was a

254
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:04,339
very easy to compromise they have a

255
00:12:01,309 --> 00:12:08,480
water bugs a lot of issues and as a

256
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:11,300
result just people abused them and they

257
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,509
can build fairly large botnets a very

258
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:17,120
good example would be the Mirai botnet

259
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:21,800
which was very popular at the end of

260
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:23,740
2016 and gave me I did a fairly good

261
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:27,019
operation took down the folks that

262
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:30,319
started the botnet but one of them

263
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:33,259
released the source code under the

264
00:12:30,319 --> 00:12:36,110
moniker I'm a senpai and this was

265
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:37,970
actually because they were trying to

266
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:39,709
kind of have a possible deniability

267
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:41,839
widel they had a source code because

268
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:44,719
they download it so if they make it open

269
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,399
source that that's great if they get

270
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,750
busted then they were like oh I don't

271
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,680
know the source code that's what I have

272
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:51,949
it

273
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:54,290
however this caused quite a lot of cable

274
00:12:51,949 --> 00:12:55,910
because a lot of other players

275
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:57,980
downloaded the source code started

276
00:12:55,910 --> 00:13:02,410
modifying it and now I have a bunch of

277
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:05,400
Mirai variants that they used

278
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:07,500
so now major

279
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,150
events another major event was the

280
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:12,350
lizard stereotypes around Christmas of

281
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:16,620
2015 which was again embedded devices

282
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:19,140
compromised CMS systems mostly Duma and

283
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:21,000
WordPress have targeted one of that

284
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,110
starts at around twenty thirteen which

285
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,890
attacks against US financial

286
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:27,810
institutions after the some of the

287
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:31,860
penalties that were that were imposed

288
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:33,540
against Iran and this is still

289
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:38,610
continuing to be a trend but it is not

290
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:41,339
not that that that big is for example

291
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:43,920
IOT devices till the major problem is

292
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:45,930
that again there are water bugs in those

293
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:49,260
systems people install them once and

294
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:53,250
they never upgrade them so this becomes

295
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:56,040
very easy target exploitation now one

296
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:58,940
other thing to note is that his attacker

297
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:01,319
self becoming more and more advanced

298
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:03,390
there was a time when we would see a

299
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,310
peach pit bug and then there would be a

300
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:07,410
water skinning because people are trying

301
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:09,300
to figure out where this bug can

302
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:12,180
actually be exploited now they

303
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:14,209
preemptively scan at very low speed but

304
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:17,069
they record the versions of different

305
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:19,050
instances of what present when a bug

306
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:20,640
comes you just play their database and

307
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:24,000
now they know what hit they don't have

308
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:28,920
to do additional squaring scanning

309
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,630
apologized okay so booters and stressors

310
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:34,439
well it's the same thing just two

311
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:37,380
different terms those are usually used

312
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:40,200
in computer by people that play computer

313
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:42,480
games and they use those services in

314
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:44,400
order to boot somebody or after the game

315
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:49,410
or at least decrease their performance

316
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:51,660
so that they can steal their gold or

317
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:55,530
whatever they need to do to disable the

318
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:57,270
tab temporarily so those you know stuff

319
00:14:55,530 --> 00:15:00,180
that around World of Warcraft then

320
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:03,990
League of Legends and so on those are

321
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:07,859
fairly inexpensive they reduce usually

322
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:09,600
small attacks for shooting gigs up to 40

323
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:12,480
gigs these exceptions is what I have

324
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,100
seen and usually the duration is short

325
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,780
for a couple of reasons first to boot

326
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,400
somebody of a game or at least disrupt

327
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:19,040
them see if you

328
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:20,390
only takes about five minutes maybe a

329
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,640
little bit more but also when the

330
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:25,720
attacks are smaller it's hard to have

331
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:28,580
those tracked and and also detected even

332
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:31,790
many of the providers - are using mrtg

333
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:34,550
drugs or derivatives the only scan every

334
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:38,620
five minutes so when they keep the

335
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:38,620
attack short they also avoid detection

336
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:47,270
okay low cost resulting from reflection

337
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:50,420
so let's look at this if we have an

338
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:53,720
attacker that operates a botnet they

339
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:55,490
have to have multiple components come

340
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,560
into play so they have to have to

341
00:15:55,490 --> 00:16:00,140
support eight many control server they

342
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:02,540
have to have all those BOTS and they

343
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:04,670
also have to have the software running

344
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:09,349
on all of those which means that they

345
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:13,640
have to infect those machines now if

346
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:16,210
they were to basically do that they

347
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:20,270
would have to have let's say a mail list

348
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:22,640
where they send particular email that

349
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:25,100
that entices people to click on link or

350
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:27,650
something along those lines that they

351
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:30,470
also have to operate the software that's

352
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:31,459
going to be infecting those machines and

353
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:33,620
so on

354
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:35,990
they can also alternatively come and buy

355
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:37,700
those infections about a couple of years

356
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:41,210
ago when I did some research that a

357
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:43,550
priest or8 for home computers was about

358
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:46,820
a hundred and forty eight hours four

359
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:49,010
thousand machines in the US so it's not

360
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:52,400
that bad but students that's an expense

361
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:54,920
that they have to incur also from a

362
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,449
legal point of view there is a couple of

363
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,459
things that are happening here so each

364
00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:01,190
of those machines that is compromised is

365
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:05,540
actually an authorized access to a

366
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:07,070
computer and then also it all the

367
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:09,530
traffic is going to a particular command

368
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:11,329
and control server so it is it is much

369
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:13,849
easier for those people to be traced

370
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:15,800
back and then investigated and then this

371
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:19,760
machine can also be seized the database

372
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:22,250
can be investigated and so on so there

373
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,690
is a word living here so it's not only

374
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,730
the magnetic cores but also there is a

375
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:28,459
lot of legal costs the tinkers or legal

376
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:29,150
risk now if they were to use reflectors

377
00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:34,190
the attack

378
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:36,860
just needs to get a list of reflectors

379
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:38,750
and then all they need to do is send the

380
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,919
traffic to those misconfigured machines

381
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:42,380
and then they're going to bounce the

382
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:45,320
traffic back so here they are exploiting

383
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:48,350
those machines however they are not

384
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:50,990
compromising any of those machines until

385
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:52,939
about probably nine 12 months ago this

386
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:55,300
was also fairly difficult to prosecute

387
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:59,030
now he was Angeles officer dapi I

388
00:17:55,300 --> 00:18:01,250
started using wire fraud by wire this is

389
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:03,950
one of the ways to do this and they have

390
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:05,720
been successful in prosecution but until

391
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:08,720
about you know I'm not so real this was

392
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:19,640
also difficult to prosecute so any

393
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:23,320
questions okay I don't see any okay cool

394
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:30,170
I am hoping I am looking at the right

395
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:35,510
channel on this court I'm just making

396
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:47,200
sure that I'm in the right place maybe

397
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:49,910
not okay cool then continue so adversary

398
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,260
just quickly here it could be a lot of

399
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:53,350
different things could be professional

400
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:56,390
DDoS operators just booter stressors

401
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:58,550
hacktivists was popular or black

402
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:00,320
I foresee the current events maybe

403
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:01,930
there'll be some activism showing up

404
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:07,090
soon as well

405
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:10,940
motivation fairly straightforward here

406
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:13,639
you know could be just trying to make a

407
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:16,400
statement or could be financial gain

408
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:23,380
about three four years ago there was a

409
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:27,650
war of emails going to people stating

410
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:30,350
hey we're going to dinner service your

411
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:33,590
website if you do not pay X amount of

412
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:35,689
bitcoins now in the beginning that can

413
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:38,389
sounded scary because a few of those

414
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:40,970
actually fouled up with the tax but for

415
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:42,159
the most part turned out that those are

416
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:44,740
mostly

417
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:47,830
and they were just using people's fear

418
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:51,220
but again the extortion is a possibility

419
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:54,820
here and other kinds of financial gain

420
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:56,830
can be efficient as well also like

421
00:19:54,820 --> 00:20:00,689
destroying the branding for company is

422
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:04,360
you know one one thing that can be used

423
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:05,890
just targeting company and like company

424
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,178
may be afraid that they will lose their

425
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:10,390
brand so for example if Nike is

426
00:20:07,179 --> 00:20:13,419
threatened that their website is not

427
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:16,630
going to be available or major media for

428
00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:19,779
example is threatened they they may

429
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:21,760
cement that or figure out how to solve

430
00:20:19,779 --> 00:20:24,789
the problem anyway another thing that's

431
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:27,279
interesting here is that many providers

432
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:32,669
that operate web application firewalls

433
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:36,850
they have fairly heavy set approves and

434
00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:39,909
during attack to alleviate the pressure

435
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:42,789
on the compute component of their fire

436
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:46,570
road they may disable some of the more

437
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:49,120
complicated rules and this has been used

438
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:52,990
in the past to attack somebody so that

439
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:55,360
they remove some of the more advanced

440
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:58,090
rules in the rule set and then the

441
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:04,330
attacker continues with exploitation of

442
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:07,870
the website okay what are the booters we

443
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:10,330
can cover it aware of those in the paths

444
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:12,939
in the in the overview slides

445
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:16,408
felling expensive short burst attacks

446
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:18,909
rudimentary scripts and so on now

447
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:20,770
looking at the user interface this is

448
00:21:18,909 --> 00:21:24,850
how those look you just basically go to

449
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:26,408
a website and you can pay you know 15

450
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:29,620
dollars an hour for example for basic

451
00:21:26,409 --> 00:21:31,299
service 200 something and so on you can

452
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:34,178
see the different prices here some of

453
00:21:31,299 --> 00:21:37,240
them also come in Bitcoin PayPal and all

454
00:21:34,179 --> 00:21:40,060
kinds of forms of payment they also

455
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,279
offered the edge boards like this one

456
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:43,450
[Music]

457
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:45,970
where they give you general information

458
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:49,059
about the site convenient executing and

459
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:52,240
so on what's also interesting to note is

460
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:55,779
that it appears that those frameworks

461
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:58,450
are fairly commonly be used

462
00:21:55,779 --> 00:22:00,250
you can just see that the template here

463
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:03,940
is different so the covers of different

464
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:05,919
but it's the same software behind it and

465
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:08,380
there were also cases where the same

466
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:10,299
operator would wooden on multiple front

467
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:12,700
ends and knowing that their syllabus is

468
00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:15,070
not very good quality so people go by

469
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:16,990
self is from one of the front ends then

470
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:19,120
they get upset did the service working

471
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:20,440
very well then go by series from one of

472
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,850
the other front ends and they think

473
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:25,500
they're buying from different operators

474
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:30,418
when they buy from the same fraudster so

475
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:30,419
that's kind of on that topic questions

476
00:22:31,139 --> 00:22:36,760
okay so we're going to look at a few

477
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:40,299
attacks in particular one of them is

478
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:42,100
sinful this is a classic attack which

479
00:22:40,299 --> 00:22:44,590
has been working for I don't know how

480
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:47,860
many years as probably 25 years ago the

481
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:48,760
first time when I encountered it it is

482
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:51,639
still relevant

483
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:53,889
unfortunately what does this attack do

484
00:22:51,639 --> 00:22:55,719
well it exploits the t way handshake

485
00:22:53,889 --> 00:22:59,320
what happens during the t-wayne

486
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:03,490
handshake we have a client that sends a

487
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:08,080
packet with the syn flag on and then the

488
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:12,820
server will respond and they will set

489
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:14,678
the acknowledgment flag on and then this

490
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:16,689
is going to establish the connection in

491
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:18,519
one direction now in order to establish

492
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:20,380
the connection in this in the other

493
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:22,000
direction we have to have one more

494
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:24,730
acknowledgment packet sent from the

495
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,549
client to the server and those three

496
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:29,500
packets are known as to a handshake one

497
00:23:27,549 --> 00:23:33,700
thing I forgot to mention here you see

498
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:35,080
how this server has to keep state for

499
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:37,299
all of those incoming packets how

500
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,949
quickly go back here see how the first

501
00:23:37,299 --> 00:23:41,039
packet comes in and the server has to

502
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:44,049
keep state here I only have displayed

503
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:45,549
the sequence number but there's other

504
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:50,500
information that the server has to keep

505
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:52,990
as well so what is this attack doing oh

506
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:55,210
it is exploiting this very need of the

507
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:58,360
server to keep state about incoming syn

508
00:23:55,210 --> 00:24:01,029
packets once we have too many packets

509
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:03,939
there will be not enough slots here to

510
00:24:01,029 --> 00:24:06,669
store information about those and even

511
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:08,020
though the server is responding if the

512
00:24:06,669 --> 00:24:10,270
attacker chain

513
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:12,160
is the source IP address to random IP

514
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:14,560
addresses there will be no pattern that

515
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:16,120
can be filtered by the defenders blend

516
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:18,250
those all those packets will be going to

517
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:20,459
random places on the Internet those

518
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:23,920
machines there will be dropping those

519
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:26,560
addresses or those those packets or

520
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:28,900
responding with some form of ICMP

521
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:31,330
depending on if there's a firewall

522
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:33,190
configured and so on but they will not

523
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:36,909
complete the two-way handshake which is

524
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:39,670
going to make this server wait for 60

525
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:42,280
seconds before it can reuse this slot

526
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:50,910
well having in mind the dog slots count

527
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:55,120
it mean thousand to four thousand okay

528
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:57,670
thousand and four thousand they will you

529
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,129
know one packet per second you can

530
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:01,600
easily see that here we're talking about

531
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:04,330
bandwidth on the order of Q bits per

532
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:08,770
second it can saturate completely a

533
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:11,409
server so that's fairly low and then

534
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:13,629
with that would require for this for

535
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:19,840
this several pay or sell for form to be

536
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:21,430
saturated there's also different ways

537
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:25,090
the queues are organized

538
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:27,640
I'm not going to or details here but the

539
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:29,580
idea basically is that in some cases you

540
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:35,890
may also have even smaller

541
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:37,300
queue lengths so how do we solve this

542
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:40,540
problem actually let's look at the mat

543
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:48,030
first so we have the back let's assume

544
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:50,889
1,000 slots in the queue the backlog

545
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:55,030
time time out or seen this if time out

546
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:56,140
is 60 seconds the sim packet is you know

547
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:58,870
the minimum packet that can be

548
00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:00,310
transmitted is a 60 64 bytes because

549
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:02,770
that's the minimum frame it can go on

550
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:04,720
Ethernet the minimum legal frame then

551
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:06,370
you have inter packet gap which is

552
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:10,210
another tiny bug so let's say eighty

553
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:12,820
four bytes what does that mean that four

554
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:17,680
thousand packets per minute we will be

555
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:19,240
looking at one point four K in order to

556
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,530
saturate this machine and as I already

557
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,770
showed in the previous slide some

558
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:26,570
machines may be configured

559
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:29,510
given lower number of slots now if we

560
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:32,720
decide to lower this time out here from

561
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:34,850
60 seconds to 30 seconds then this

562
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,320
number will merely double to point n

563
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:38,540
cubed so who cares

564
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:41,000
well let's decrease this number 60 times

565
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:42,860
this thing is going to go up 60 times

566
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,600
which were still going to look at like

567
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:47,149
90 Q bits per second which is again

568
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:49,820
nothing however when we start going to a

569
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:52,580
second or subsequent now the round-trip

570
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:54,350
time for some coins that are far away

571
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:56,060
will not be sufficient for that to

572
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:58,520
complete the TV a handshake does this

573
00:26:56,060 --> 00:27:01,760
really doesn't work because we will not

574
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:04,510
be able to have everybody complete tyj

575
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,770
check just thinking about a satellite

576
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:08,210
uplink if it goes to one hope we're

577
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:12,560
looking already at five to six hunt

578
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:15,560
least seconds latency just fiber you

579
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:16,879
know going around you know from one

580
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:19,040
continent to another we're looking at

581
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:22,360
200 milliseconds 200 milliseconds so

582
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:24,889
this is not a good way to mitigate this

583
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:26,449
increasing the number of slots is not

584
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:29,030
another way to deal with that there

585
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:31,430
again increasing the slots just double

586
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:33,260
like why to you just double this now we

587
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:36,380
require two times bigger number again

588
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:39,410
this doesn't scale very well this is how

589
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:44,330
this will look if we use next time to

590
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:46,550
observe the state of the server on the

591
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:47,270
receiving end you're going to see water

592
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:52,210
packets

593
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:59,720
sorry Wharf sockets insane receive state

594
00:27:52,210 --> 00:28:01,520
and that's basically very can a very

595
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:04,790
very obvious way to detect this

596
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:07,670
attackers yeah it's it has a very clear

597
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:09,470
fingerprint now how are we going to

598
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:12,050
mitigate this well we're going to use

599
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:15,260
something called sink okay so the sink

600
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:16,790
cookies are basically going to store

601
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:20,420
this information if you remember there

602
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:22,790
was this set of this storage that had

603
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:25,790
many slots that is the component that's

604
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:27,770
exploited well if we can find a way to

605
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:29,389
preserve this information without

606
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:30,350
keeping it in the memory of the server

607
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:35,000
then

608
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:36,949
we will be in very good shape so this is

609
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,360
what the sin cookie essentially is it is

610
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:44,780
going to preserve this initial sequence

611
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:46,549
number by encoding it into this into the

612
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:48,590
into the return package so it's going to

613
00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:50,480
take some key options like source IP

614
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:53,360
address destination IP address source

615
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:58,010
port destination port and subset of the

616
00:28:53,360 --> 00:29:04,158
options and it is going to hatch them

617
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:08,419
and then encode them back into the into

618
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:10,039
the sequence number of the packet that

619
00:29:08,419 --> 00:29:12,140
it sends back so let's see how this

620
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:14,600
thing would look we have source IP

621
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:16,429
address disruptions interval and so on

622
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:18,678
and then calculating sync okay let's

623
00:29:16,429 --> 00:29:20,390
call this sync cookie is t45 here I'm

624
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:21,950
using intentionally small numbers

625
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:23,840
because we are human and we don't work

626
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:26,720
very well with numbers in the order of

627
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:31,010
billions so here this sequence number is

628
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:32,780
embedded into the packet and then when

629
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:34,730
the third packet comes in because the

630
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:38,120
rules dictate this number would be

631
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:40,250
increased by one and when it is received

632
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:42,399
on this side if C is there enabled

633
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:46,190
because obviously you know they are or

634
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:48,140
it will calculate the same hash add one

635
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:51,020
to it and if the number matches this one

636
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:53,990
the server now knows for sure that the

637
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:56,840
first packet actually arrived and here

638
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:58,789
the hash will match now one thing I

639
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:01,370
think I didn't mention is also there is

640
00:29:58,789 --> 00:30:03,919
a time interval their time of arrival

641
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:05,629
which gives the 64 seconds resolution

642
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:09,470
which is pretty close to the 60 seconds

643
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:11,900
timeout for the scene receive slot which

644
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:14,510
is protecting us against replay attacks

645
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:17,360
so this is preventing somebody from

646
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:18,860
replaying single piece in packets

647
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:24,080
sending them back to the server just

648
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:26,719
because this timer would have the time

649
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:30,710
of arrival would would not be would not

650
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:33,140
match so the hash will not match or will

651
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:35,330
not be within 64 seconds so anyway

652
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:40,240
that's kind of how the thing cookies

653
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:40,240
work any questions

654
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:53,610
okay okay so now we're going to look at

655
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:55,530
a deflection educational tasks this is

656
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:56,909
what I was saying initially that this

657
00:30:55,530 --> 00:31:00,270
make things a little bit more confusing

658
00:30:56,910 --> 00:31:02,130
in the distributed name service attacks

659
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:04,260
or made it confusing five years ago now

660
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:05,790
it's pretty much common practice it's

661
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:08,550
actually the predominant type of attacks

662
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:11,460
nowadays but having said that there are

663
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:12,570
two terms that often get completed but

664
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,800
they're different one of them is

665
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:17,129
amplification the other one is

666
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:21,720
deflection so the reflection one

667
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:24,030
basically is the ability to send packets

668
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:28,350
and then force the other side to send

669
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:31,950
the response to another party usually

670
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:36,419
this is achieved by changing the sort

671
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:38,970
the source IP address and many protocols

672
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:41,400
would not do this validation on protocol

673
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:45,360
level it will allow for the for the

674
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:49,350
other party to achieve something yes the

675
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:51,149
slides will be available and actually I

676
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:55,080
will also point you to another link

677
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:57,540
where I have a larger deck so I'll do

678
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:59,520
that at the end thank you for or I will

679
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:04,290
post it in the problem thank you for

680
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:06,210
asking so this is saying with UDP aware

681
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:08,580
of the protocols on top of that like DNS

682
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:10,590
for example they don't need to establish

683
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:13,020
the handshake so if you spooby at the

684
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:16,100
source IP address it's very easy for

685
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:18,330
this thing to contextually make sense

686
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:21,840
for the servers and for them to

687
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:24,570
determine proper responses now if you do

688
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:26,419
this with protocols like TCP at best you

689
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:29,639
can have only the syn ACK packet

690
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:32,100
reflected somewhere which still does

691
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:33,390
give you some level of amplification and

692
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:35,760
we'll look at that in a second

693
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:38,220
but it is not as efficient as with UDP

694
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:41,010
and protocols on top of that like DNS

695
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:44,550
for example so reflection illustrate it

696
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:47,100
here we have an unwilling intermediary

697
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:49,500
which is reflector here the attacker

698
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:52,189
sends a packet they are going to spoof

699
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:53,960
the source IP address with the

700
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:57,429
IP address of the target and then the

701
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,429
response is going to hit the target

702
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:04,759
okay now protocols as I mentioned

703
00:33:03,019 --> 00:33:08,870
already the ones that are really easy

704
00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:10,820
DNS MTP SCTP now before we go to actual

705
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:14,330
attacks I want to show you amplification

706
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:17,240
just so that you know I'm exhaustive in

707
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:19,610
this so amplification is when you have a

708
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:23,720
smoke query for example DNS is a very

709
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:26,570
good example we have a an any query that

710
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:28,429
only asked for those nine letters

711
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:32,809
basically technically ten because

712
00:33:28,429 --> 00:33:34,639
there's a dot this will be at best 64

713
00:33:32,809 --> 00:33:35,629
byte packet because of the framing as I

714
00:33:34,639 --> 00:33:37,699
discussed earlier

715
00:33:35,629 --> 00:33:41,600
however the answer is going to be much

716
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:43,759
bigger now note here that protocols like

717
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:46,309
SEC make things even worse

718
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:48,919
just because then the records here who

719
00:33:46,309 --> 00:33:51,500
have much more data they have public

720
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:54,110
keys and so on and so on so this answer

721
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:56,450
here will be much bigger now many years

722
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:59,330
ago DNS could only respond with up to

723
00:33:56,450 --> 00:34:05,269
512 bytes just because this would

724
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:07,279
specification but then with ideon s0 we

725
00:34:05,269 --> 00:34:12,918
currently have the ability to send

726
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:14,839
multiple K traffic back ok so what is

727
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:17,750
the smallest DNS query possible I kind

728
00:34:14,839 --> 00:34:22,429
of answered that question already this

729
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:24,889
is how it's going to look 64 bytes v 512

730
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:28,760
bytes that responds now a piece of

731
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:32,210
trivia here the reason there are 13 root

732
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:37,250
DNS servers is because you could only

733
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:45,079
fit 13 in the answer we you could only

734
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:47,960
fit 13 servers in the 512 byte answer so

735
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:48,950
anyway so looking at the amplifiers they

736
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,379
pretty much of the same as the

737
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:53,689
deflectors this is a table that gives

738
00:34:51,379 --> 00:34:56,210
you the different quotients of

739
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:58,730
amplification I have taken this from

740
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:59,820
us-cert some of the numbers I don't

741
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:04,500
agree with but I think it

742
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:10,410
very good reference and can give you

743
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:13,220
kind of from course like a picture of

744
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:15,990
what can amplify how much

745
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:16,740
okay so DNS reflection how does this

746
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:20,399
thing work

747
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:23,279
well we have a query type Amy we send

748
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,800
this query type and it's going to get

749
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,950
all those answers this is how it's going

750
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:31,110
to look what data coming back we're

751
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:33,870
going to have the attacker send a packet

752
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:36,480
and then they're going to spool the

753
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:38,940
source IP address see here IP the source

754
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:42,200
IP this is 1000 10 which is the target

755
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:44,910
and then the reflector itself which is a

756
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:47,069
recursive DNS server so this is attack

757
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:49,560
using recursive DNS servers not the

758
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:52,800
authoritative DNS servers it's going to

759
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:55,259
respond back with the answer now keep in

760
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,210
mind that once the first query comes in

761
00:35:55,260 --> 00:36:00,000
this answer is also going to be cached

762
00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:03,140
on the recursive server which means that

763
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:07,170
for every next query it is going to

764
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:16,980
provide sub-millisecond responses so it

765
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:20,220
can fire it very rapid very high rate so

766
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:23,130
DNS reflection basically is I do sent

767
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:25,620
this bad query not only very fast to the

768
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:28,590
same server but I also send it to many

769
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:30,600
servers at the same time and then the

770
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:34,710
target gets overwhelmed with the traffic

771
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:36,720
coming back now in order to execute this

772
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:39,900
attack first you you've seen here how

773
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:42,390
I'm using / you dot edu / you you never

774
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:45,060
know that anything happened just because

775
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:47,220
all of those are recursive servers they

776
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:50,730
do not belong to preview or anybody else

777
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:52,290
that's related and they just catch the

778
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:55,230
answer and then they send the answer as

779
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:57,810
fast as they can some in some cases

780
00:36:55,230 --> 00:37:00,860
attackers have even registered their own

781
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:04,830
domains because they have control of the

782
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:08,340
content of the actual zone and then they

783
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:09,630
stop the zone with a war of junk just so

784
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:12,570
that they can get better

785
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:14,160
amplification higher amplification level

786
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:17,220
because they can stick there

787
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:18,540
is many DNS SEC keys even those will be

788
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:20,850
even though those would be invalid

789
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:23,820
they're still going to be 4k DNS SEC

790
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:27,930
keys many of them and here we have very

791
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:30,900
large answers so again I'm just going to

792
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:33,660
reiterate this even though you may see a

793
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:36,480
domain here this in no way can be used

794
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:38,580
as attribution the reason I'm saying it

795
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,410
because I have seen people go and try to

796
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:41,160
do attribution which doesn't make any

797
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:43,680
sense

798
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:47,850
but again just mention it here as a

799
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:49,710
caveat so any questions on DNS reflected

800
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:59,850
the text I'm just going to take a sip of

801
00:37:49,710 --> 00:38:01,770
water because my voice is going bad okay

802
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:06,029
I guess no questions at least I'm not

803
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:09,900
seeing anything okay ntp reflection so

804
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:13,170
here the situation is similar but we

805
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:15,810
don't have recursive DNS servers we have

806
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:18,390
NTP servers the way NTP works is you

807
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:20,910
have different stratum servers the lower

808
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:23,400
the number the closer they are or the

809
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:26,700
smaller the variance of the answer the

810
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:29,730
tolerance of the answer we as as a

811
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:32,129
matter time is so the hardest rat on the

812
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:34,620
course of their Twitter atomic clock or

813
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:38,160
some other way like radio codes and so

814
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:40,319
on and lower stratum Silver's basically

815
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:42,359
what people run on their networks now in

816
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,790
some data centers they may have one

817
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:48,180
server in the data center itself for

818
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:53,370
example feeding of a GPS unit that is

819
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:55,290
taking tank on steroids so this NTP

820
00:38:53,370 --> 00:39:00,870
server another implementation of it

821
00:38:55,290 --> 00:39:03,090
would store IP addresses in a table

822
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:04,980
every time somebody queries the NTP

823
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:08,190
server it would store the IP address of

824
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:10,560
the client which is very useful because

825
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:11,760
you know now who is using your NTP

826
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,920
server and if you decide to do

827
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,830
maintenance you know which machines lose

828
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:19,260
the ability to have time however there

829
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:21,270
was one shortcut they had implemented

830
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:23,520
that instead of having to log in the

831
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:24,930
server and query the state of the server

832
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:27,340
while you're logged into the machine

833
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:30,520
there was a remote command

834
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:33,280
that an iterator could issue called Mon

835
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:36,490
list which would basically return a copy

836
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:39,160
of that list to the administrator well

837
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:42,790
you guessed it what if I change if a bad

838
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:44,410
guy changes the IP address of the source

839
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:46,570
IP address with the address of the

840
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:49,750
victim well this traffic is going to be

841
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:53,170
sent to the victim now imagine that

842
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:55,690
instead of doing this to one NTP server

843
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:58,300
they use a very large number of entity

844
00:39:55,690 --> 00:40:00,190
servers and help the victim is buried

845
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:01,770
with responses so I'm going to go over

846
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:03,520
this a little bit slower just because I

847
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:07,300
double-click by mistake

848
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:12,220
the attacker sends a packet NTP query

849
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:14,440
Mon list query to NTP server and then

850
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:16,750
inserts the IP address of the victim in

851
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:19,180
that packet so the response goes the

852
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:21,910
victim and they receive this response

853
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:23,379
now if they do this with a large number

854
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:25,359
of servers then there'll be a lot of

855
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:27,700
traffic going to that victim the other

856
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:30,250
thing here is that you can have up to

857
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:32,950
six cabinet entries that are cached in

858
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:34,720
that lower stratum server and what we

859
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:37,419
have also observed that attackers do

860
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:39,339
before they start using a server for

861
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:41,710
reflection they would prime that cache

862
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:44,290
by sending a war of queries which both

863
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:46,750
the IP addresses just so that the the

864
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:48,880
number of IP addresses here in this

865
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:50,470
table goes all the way up to 600 and

866
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:53,320
then when they start executing the

867
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:56,230
attack they'll have the full 600

868
00:40:53,320 --> 00:41:01,800
to the target versus sending your smoke

869
00:40:56,230 --> 00:41:01,800
packet with 3 and 3 is Annette questions

870
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:09,790
ok mitigation strategies so overall

871
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:11,440
mitigation strategies there's there's a

872
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:15,009
number but the biggest biggest most

873
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:19,120
important thing which I already kind of

874
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:21,670
mentioned is the cost of an outage in a

875
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:23,589
minute of outage or a day about each or

876
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:25,750
an hour about each whatever is relevant

877
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:28,360
to the business this is the most

878
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:31,270
important method you need in order to

879
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:34,270
start thinking about mitigating DDoS

880
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:36,130
attacks unless it is a matter of honor

881
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:38,470
that the website should never go down

882
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:40,900
and somebody has endless amount of money

883
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:42,459
to pour into it you really

884
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:46,569
to understand how much money would

885
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:50,589
business be losing so that then you can

886
00:41:46,569 --> 00:41:52,420
create a case taking into account the

887
00:41:50,589 --> 00:41:54,609
risk or the probability of them being

888
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:57,609
affected by the knife service attack and

889
00:41:54,609 --> 00:41:59,380
then the amount of money that they order

890
00:41:57,609 --> 00:42:05,920
to justify the amount of money that they

891
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:09,160
need to invest into mitigation so let's

892
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,059
see if we look at the kind of the risk

893
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,618
pyramid

894
00:42:10,059 --> 00:42:14,499
this is opposed to the pyramid even

895
00:42:11,619 --> 00:42:16,960
though it looks like a triangle if you

896
00:42:14,499 --> 00:42:19,240
have at the bottom very primitive basic

897
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:22,029
attackers like Ricky Lee's booters and

898
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:25,808
so on you have a war of them so if your

899
00:42:22,029 --> 00:42:28,779
body is low your defense levels are low

900
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:31,210
that means that a large number of

901
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:33,700
attackers will be able to go above it

902
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:37,150
and cross the knife service then when

903
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:39,609
you put resources into that into lifting

904
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:42,249
that bar so you put resources into being

905
00:42:39,609 --> 00:42:44,319
prepared to mitigate attacks this body

906
00:42:42,249 --> 00:42:47,009
is going to go up which is going to

907
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:50,890
severely limit the number of attackers

908
00:42:47,009 --> 00:42:53,289
that can go above that bar and cause of

909
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:54,730
disruption theoretically if you can

910
00:42:53,289 --> 00:42:58,390
raise the bar up to the top there will

911
00:42:54,730 --> 00:43:00,249
be nobody didn't take you down so if

912
00:42:58,390 --> 00:43:01,989
this is something that you that the

913
00:43:00,249 --> 00:43:03,848
company is striving for that's something

914
00:43:01,989 --> 00:43:06,640
they should do if they for example can

915
00:43:03,849 --> 00:43:08,619
afford to be down 1% of the time maybe

916
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:11,410
they should not be aiming a hundred

917
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:14,140
percent again as we know 100 percent is

918
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:16,749
very kind of nebulous thing to achieve

919
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:19,210
sometimes just simple error can cause an

920
00:43:16,749 --> 00:43:23,038
outage but anyway so that's the idea

921
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:25,450
there there are different approaches so

922
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:27,160
for large companies it would make sense

923
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:30,069
to do it themselves because they save

924
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:33,359
money because of the capability the

925
00:43:30,069 --> 00:43:36,069
skill do they have economy of numbers

926
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:38,200
helps them save money now if they have

927
00:43:36,069 --> 00:43:39,880
to if you if you if the company smaller

928
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,859
than they can outsource that and they

929
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:45,309
also can take two strategies one of them

930
00:43:41,859 --> 00:43:47,019
is on demand or always on and there's

931
00:43:45,309 --> 00:43:48,489
always the hybrids this comes from the

932
00:43:47,019 --> 00:43:50,919
salespeople because there were certain

933
00:43:48,489 --> 00:43:52,539
companies that would sell hardware but

934
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:54,760
then they saw that the hardware can no

935
00:43:52,539 --> 00:43:56,770
longer really scale up

936
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:58,570
and they had to come up with a hybrid

937
00:43:56,770 --> 00:44:00,280
version where if you go about certain

938
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:02,830
level then the hardware can no longer

939
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:05,890
help you then you send the mitigation to

940
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:09,370
the cloud going that in details so do it

941
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:11,620
yourself how that would look basically

942
00:44:09,370 --> 00:44:13,600
you have the server here that's being

943
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:15,670
protected or let's say number of servers

944
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:17,140
can be multiple call locations I'm just

945
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:19,810
drawing one because it's simple

946
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:24,310
and then you have internet now they

947
00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:25,810
known as the cloud and you have the

948
00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:28,270
regular users that are accessing the

949
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:30,340
services of that server and then you

950
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:33,310
have attackers once the attacker starts

951
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:36,250
sending traffic you can enable your

952
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:40,870
mitigation device and then filter the

953
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:44,950
traffic hopefully you know to filter it

954
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:48,630
and then problem solved now if you start

955
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:51,580
looking here at the expenses traffic

956
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:54,370
techniques but to key amount this is

957
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:56,799
from about couple of years ago and

958
00:44:54,370 --> 00:45:00,549
depending on how much bandwidth you're

959
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:02,770
buying this price conceivably may vary

960
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:05,260
if your work provider you'll be coming

961
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:07,210
at much looking at much smaller numbers

962
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:10,390
if you're a small company you probably

963
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:13,150
looking at more than that cohesion stays

964
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:15,040
and so on power equipment and you need

965
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:16,750
also personnel to manage this if you're

966
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,520
going to do this yourself you have to

967
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:21,010
have qualified people that understand

968
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:23,650
BGP understand how to move traffic

969
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:25,540
between locations and so on and actually

970
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:29,620
this is the most expensive part here

971
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:31,900
because here even at 20k per per 10

972
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:34,810
gigabit port you know it's not that much

973
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:38,650
but when you start adding 6 7 8 10

974
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:41,200
people managing that network at 200 K or

975
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:45,190
more when you include benefits then it

976
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:47,919
becomes pretty expensive now conclusions

977
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:49,900
you have full control leverage this

978
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,460
economy of scale you have more

979
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:53,260
flexibility there but you really need to

980
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:55,330
have scale in order to be able to

981
00:45:53,260 --> 00:46:00,850
execute this or to be able to support

982
00:45:55,330 --> 00:46:05,200
this external services so those are

983
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:07,819
known as mediation services or sometimes

984
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:09,770
advertised scheme pipes and so on

985
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:11,630
their pricing is different some of them

986
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:13,490
maybe based on the attack sizes sound

987
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:16,010
that may be based on the nominal clean

988
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:18,859
traffic that is coming to your location

989
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:24,650
and as I mentioned that the model can be

990
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:26,450
on demand or hours on so on demand will

991
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:28,970
look like this so you have the same

992
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:31,669
server you are protecting here you have

993
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:34,009
either detection device or can be also a

994
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:36,980
demon on the server doesn't doesn't need

995
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:39,260
to be a separate device and you have

996
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:44,090
regular traffic at the moment and attack

997
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:47,840
starts the detection device picks it up

998
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:50,780
and then it signals the cloud or signals

999
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:53,840
the mitigation provider which is going

1000
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:55,670
to inject a BGP route and as this

1001
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:58,190
Bharat is propagating it's going to

1002
00:46:55,670 --> 00:47:00,110
hijack this traffic so is no longer

1003
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:02,090
going to be coming to you but it's going

1004
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:08,540
to be going to their mitigation pods

1005
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:11,080
which are usually in pops that help that

1006
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:13,430
are close to world metro areas and

1007
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:16,009
they're ready to talk to the customers

1008
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:18,680
and distributed widely around the

1009
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:21,920
network so they can fragment the attack

1010
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:24,379
traffic into small pieces now once the

1011
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,390
traffic gets there we have a problem

1012
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:27,920
because we don't know how to send this

1013
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:30,290
traffic back to where the content is

1014
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:32,870
well we're going to use a cheery tunnel

1015
00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:35,779
and this is how the traffic is going to

1016
00:47:32,870 --> 00:47:37,580
get to that server now there is a bit of

1017
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:39,950
a problem here though if you're looking

1018
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:42,440
at let's say frame that is 1500 bytes

1019
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:47,270
the MT is 1500 bytes and if you're

1020
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:49,880
looking at saturated links or like full

1021
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:52,190
frames the moment you insert the jelly

1022
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:55,160
header each of those who have to be

1023
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:57,200
fragmented into just so it can go over

1024
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:59,180
the jail if you gather so here there's a

1025
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:02,060
war of addition overhead the overhead is

1026
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:04,069
not only the jelly header itself but it

1027
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:06,259
is the fact that many of those packets

1028
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:08,960
who have to actually be fragmented into

1029
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:11,180
and then reassembled later then you may

1030
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:15,230
have potential loss of packets and then

1031
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:16,879
the stands fish and so on so this is not

1032
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:18,470
as bad as I make it some but it's also

1033
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,210
not the stevia so there is a lot of

1034
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:21,279
overhead from because of the tiara

1035
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:25,220
tunnel

1036
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:30,880
also mitigation is another way to go

1037
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:33,890
about it so instead of having the pods

1038
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:36,950
inserted when there is an attack you

1039
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:39,558
always have them on and the actual

1040
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:44,740
silver is never observed by the internet

1041
00:48:39,559 --> 00:48:47,089
and consequentially by the attackers so

1042
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:49,640
mitigation provider just basically sits

1043
00:48:47,089 --> 00:48:52,400
all the time here the traffic goes to IP

1044
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:55,970
space here that nobody knows about and

1045
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:57,410
when the traffic comes in they do

1046
00:48:55,970 --> 00:48:58,930
whatever they need to do and they send

1047
00:48:57,410 --> 00:49:02,319
it back sorry

1048
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:05,319
and they send it back to the server now

1049
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:07,970
if you have a content delivery network

1050
00:49:05,319 --> 00:49:09,770
there are some added benefits the

1051
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:11,839
content delivery network is going to

1052
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:15,290
cache all the static content on those

1053
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:18,799
pods and this is in turn going to

1054
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:22,250
accelerate traffic delivery for all of

1055
00:49:18,799 --> 00:49:24,049
those customers that are not attackers

1056
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:27,049
they're just regular customers so in my

1057
00:49:24,049 --> 00:49:29,420
previous job before I started school

1058
00:49:27,049 --> 00:49:33,589
that's what we did we were a content

1059
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:37,010
delivery network and we were able to

1060
00:49:33,589 --> 00:49:39,799
cache huge amounts of data so having in

1061
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:42,200
mind that all those pods or the deployed

1062
00:49:39,799 --> 00:49:44,900
in points of presence or props that are

1063
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:46,899
close to large metro areas instead of

1064
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:49,970
having to go to the servers let's say of

1065
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:51,760
our customers which would be maybe

1066
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:54,680
hundred two hundred milliseconds

1067
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:57,530
round-trip time people in Los Angeles

1068
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:59,690
will be hitting a local pub with three

1069
00:49:57,530 --> 00:50:01,839
milliseconds before milliseconds worst

1070
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:04,730
case round-trip time which would

1071
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:07,130
extremely accelerate delivery because

1072
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:09,859
first to a handshake happens very fast

1073
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:11,390
then the windows grow very fast because

1074
00:50:09,859 --> 00:50:13,940
this dictionary packages is

1075
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:16,808
instantaneous probability of packet loss

1076
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:20,599
is also very slow very small and so on

1077
00:50:16,809 --> 00:50:22,400
so this is caching the content and then

1078
00:50:20,599 --> 00:50:24,380
when attackers try to attack it they

1079
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:31,430
basically get all the traffic filtered

1080
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:32,990
on those pods and that's it here the

1081
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:33,839
other thing is also that CD ends

1082
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:35,729
operated

1083
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:37,620
very high capacity Citians usually

1084
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:40,050
operated much higher capacity than the

1085
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:43,170
on-demand providers just because they

1086
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:44,550
always run over the non regular traffic

1087
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:45,990
on top of them it's not like they only

1088
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:48,120
get inserted when there is an attack

1089
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:50,279
they're always on there's another

1090
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:53,670
benefit of Citians that since they're

1091
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:56,520
always on when an attack occurs there is

1092
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:59,970
no moving parts it's already there it's

1093
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:02,190
already set up with the other method

1094
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:05,339
here we were looking at earlier see here

1095
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:07,110
before the signaling happens I get the

1096
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:09,990
attack coming in then I have to signal

1097
00:51:07,110 --> 00:51:12,540
then the BGP route has to be propagated

1098
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:14,129
usually Doby a human that may need to

1099
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:16,800
interfere after the detection actually

1100
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:20,790
and say yeah this digit do the injection

1101
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:23,040
and this time maybe two to three to five

1102
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:24,960
minutes maybe sometimes more if somebody

1103
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:27,690
has to be paged and look at it and

1104
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:29,550
during this time there may be degraded

1105
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:32,130
service performance or even complete

1106
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:35,310
outage and until mitigation comes into

1107
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:38,130
play with the CDN or always on the

1108
00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:41,040
defense is always pond and thus there is

1109
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:42,660
no problem in here's quick comparison

1110
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:45,140
I'm sorry actually this is the hybrid

1111
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:48,060
I'm tricking way too fast

1112
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:52,200
yeah so the hybrid basically will use

1113
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:55,560
the two combined things there will be a

1114
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:57,660
on-site hardware that's going to

1115
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:59,880
mitigate lower level attacks maybe or

1116
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:02,100
under five deep under ten big under

1117
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:06,330
twenty gig and then when the traffic

1118
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:08,490
starts to go above that level then it is

1119
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:15,690
going to send the mitigation to the

1120
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:18,359
cloud and here's comparison for the

1121
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:21,120
mediation service providers how it looks

1122
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:22,520
you know on one side you have you don't

1123
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:24,990
have to do with the complexity

1124
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:28,200
accelerates company delivery if it's a

1125
00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:30,810
CDN in ultimately ends up cheaper you

1126
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:33,870
can have it did yourself unless you're

1127
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:36,180
really reward company like for example

1128
00:52:33,870 --> 00:52:39,210
Google has no point in using an external

1129
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:45,620
cm because Google itself is hesitancy

1130
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:45,620
and same with Facebook questions

1131
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:51,799
okay that's it

1132
00:52:58,530 --> 00:53:00,590
you
