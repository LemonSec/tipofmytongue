or so give or take together I'll tell

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,490
you a little bit about myself again my

10
00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:36,129
name is Mark Orlando and today I want to

11
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:38,449
talk to you about building stock teams

12
00:00:36,129 --> 00:00:41,480
because this is a passion of mine and

13
00:00:38,449 --> 00:00:44,329
I've spent about 19 years in

14
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:50,899
cybersecurity mostly in security

15
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:53,989
operations and I've built or lead or

16
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:55,609
assessed security operations teams in a

17
00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:57,589
lot of different environments a lot of

18
00:00:55,609 --> 00:01:00,500
different sectors at the White House the

19
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:02,120
Department of Energy more recently I was

20
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:05,600
the chief technology officer for

21
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:07,700
Raytheon's cyber business I spent a lot

22
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,759
of years on the manage security service

23
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:14,870
provider side and in manage detection

24
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:18,050
and response providers and I'm also the

25
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:21,620
founder co-founder and CEO of Bionic

26
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:25,700
which is a blue team focused cyber

27
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:27,980
security services firm I'm also an

28
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,840
instructor for sans psych 450 class

29
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:33,230
which is blue team fundamentals and

30
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,670
security operations I'll be taking a few

31
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:37,340
notes from that class and sharing with

32
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:39,650
them sharing them with you today and I

33
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:42,890
also happen to be an eighties kid so I

34
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:44,930
couldn't pass up the opportunity to drop

35
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,820
in some cool eighties references here

36
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:49,250
that's why I'm going to be talking a

37
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:51,050
little bit about the a-team now if you

38
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:53,330
haven't seen the a-team or are not

39
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:55,729
familiar with that show you're still

40
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:58,640
gonna get this talk it's okay just know

41
00:01:55,730 --> 00:02:02,420
that I feel sad for you and you should

42
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,070
rectify that as soon as possible but why

43
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:06,680
are we talking about this why do I feel

44
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:08,030
that this is something that rates some

45
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:12,379
of our time today is something that we

46
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:14,730
need to address well fundamentally the

47
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:17,549
biggest reason is that

48
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:21,268
I hope we all agree that people not

49
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:23,280
tools not fancy subscriptions or

50
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:25,860
technology but people will make or break

51
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,360
your security team you can have the best

52
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,580
tools in the world you can have the

53
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,160
biggest security budget if you don't

54
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:35,489
have a great group of people operating

55
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,579
them you're not gonna be operating at a

56
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:41,610
high level and more than that good

57
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,170
people are really hard to find they're

58
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,180
really hard to find and if you can find

59
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:47,819
them they're really tough to keep and

60
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:50,430
retain they're tough to empower

61
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:52,530
sometimes and if you're trying to build

62
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:55,109
up a team and create that a team

63
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,940
yourself it can be tough to know where

64
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:59,220
to prioritize your time and resources

65
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:01,019
for things like training and team

66
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,519
building building out those

67
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:03,629
interpersonal relationships so we're

68
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:08,819
gonna talk about that a little bit today

69
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:10,798
and in my personal opinion I think the

70
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:14,040
traditional ops model that we have this

71
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:15,989
concept of security operations we're all

72
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,780
sort of sitting in a room maybe a

73
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:20,639
virtual room looking at events opening

74
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,859
tickets kind of the more traditional way

75
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:26,160
of doing things that's not really

76
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:27,510
optimized for the great people that we

77
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:33,180
want to bring in and I'll talk a little

78
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:35,190
bit about why now the titles of these

79
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,810
next few slides fall firmly into the

80
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:39,000
category of if you're not familiar with

81
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:42,180
the a-team TV show you may not get it

82
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,980
but that's okay if you have a problem

83
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,419
and I think we all have a challenge of

84
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,819
some sort which is why you're you're

85
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:50,340
tuning into this talk today that problem

86
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:54,018
is building sock teams is a challenge

87
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:56,010
it's difficult why is it difficult

88
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:57,840
oftentimes we have a lack of business

89
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:00,030
business alignment we're not

90
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,849
particularly well aligned the

91
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:04,790
organization that we're protecting we

92
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:06,959
might have data and tools challenges

93
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:08,519
maybe we don't have enough the right

94
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,099
kind of tools the right kind of

95
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:12,840
visibility or maybe we have too much and

96
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:15,328
so much data so many alerts so many

97
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,160
events so many things to do that we

98
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:19,349
can't possibly do them all in a

99
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,750
reasonable amount of time I already

100
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:24,270
mentioned this outdated concept of this

101
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,330
fuller watcher I mean we're all made to

102
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:28,650
sit down and look at a queue of alerts

103
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:30,840
and that is the some toe

104
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:32,719
all of our focus as security operators

105
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,280
it's not really where we want to be and

106
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:39,449
I also think more of a systemic problem

107
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:41,549
is this concept of sustainment so if

108
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:44,630
you've ever worked in a sock or built a

109
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:47,820
sock or a defensive team of any kind

110
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:50,550
from the ground up you've probably been

111
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:52,650
familiar with this concept of

112
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:54,539
sustainment where you have a phase where

113
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:56,008
you're deploying tools and you're hiring

114
00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:59,360
people and you're building everything

115
00:04:56,009 --> 00:05:03,150
out and then you get to a point where

116
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,800
you feel like okay that's done my tools

117
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:06,900
are deployed I'm up and running I have

118
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,520
my SOPs and now we just kind of go into

119
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,919
this sustainment and over to ongoing

120
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:14,340
operations whatever you want to call it

121
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:15,960
and there's a tendency and sometimes an

122
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:19,080
organizational pressure to kind of sit

123
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:21,750
back and just kind of let it ride right

124
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,630
just watch those alerts roll in follow

125
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:27,750
your SOPs right and I'll talk today

126
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:30,180
about why that is a problem and why that

127
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:32,000
creates a kind of inertia that really

128
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:34,979
goes against what we're trying to do in

129
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,539
building those Sakae teams those really

130
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:42,719
high performing teams and no one else

131
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:44,370
can help you right fortunately in our

132
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,470
case I think there are people out there

133
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:49,229
that can help us I don't believe that

134
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:53,490
there is a talent shortage and security

135
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:55,229
operations I think that we have an

136
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:58,650
expectations versus reality

137
00:05:55,229 --> 00:06:01,440
challenge in our industry I think we

138
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:04,888
have not been inclusive enough we're not

139
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,380
maybe looking in the right places again

140
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:09,539
if you have been fortunate enough to to

141
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:11,520
been able to see the formation of a

142
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:13,110
security team from the ground up or even

143
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,580
if you've come into a situation where

144
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:16,919
you're a hiring manager or you have

145
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,859
visibility into that I think many of us

146
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:21,510
have seen situations where we're

147
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:24,539
bringing in operators we're bringing in

148
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:26,219
the blue teamers defenders and we're

149
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:30,510
expecting all of these things from them

150
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:34,500
as a defender you have to be part

151
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:40,039
analyst part data scientist investigator

152
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:42,210
engineer user Support Specialist right

153
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:46,259
Intel analyst in some case

154
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:49,489
and yet you know we expect someone to be

155
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:52,560
that all of those things on day one and

156
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:55,169
then in many cases we talk about that

157
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,690
sustainment model we often expect those

158
00:06:55,169 --> 00:07:00,960
people to sit down and look at alerts

159
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:02,819
monitor this email INBOX you know listen

160
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,258
field user complaints right and those

161
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:05,910
things are okay and those things might

162
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:08,580
be part of the job but there's a

163
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:12,870
fundamental mismatch there in what we

164
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:15,389
expect what we expect on day one right

165
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:18,570
out of the gate and then what we expect

166
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:20,280
those individuals to do relative to our

167
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:21,599
initial expectations so I think that's

168
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,530
really what we have to address and this

169
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:28,229
we're gonna talk a little bit about

170
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:30,000
today fortunately we are not the 18 on

171
00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:32,219
the TV show we don't have to break out

172
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,080
of a federal stockade we don't have to

173
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,430
break out of jail where we're wrongly in

174
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,609
prison right we just have to be able to

175
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:41,130
navigate these particular challenges

176
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:43,949
right and fight our way into building

177
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:46,050
that that high-performing team so before

178
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:47,759
we get started on doing that there are a

179
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:50,130
few fundamental considerations that I

180
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,020
think set the stage for this kind of

181
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:54,479
discussion right we need to think about

182
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:57,659
direction right where are we trying to

183
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:59,159
go and the answer to that is not we're

184
00:07:57,659 --> 00:08:00,599
just trying to get up and running right

185
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:02,190
and then it's smooth sailing know where

186
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:04,500
strategically are we trying to go what

187
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:07,320
value are we trying to bring to our

188
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:09,780
organization what is our purpose

189
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:13,440
what's the Sauk Charter right what are

190
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:16,229
we here to do how are we going to foster

191
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,729
teamwork and build interpersonal

192
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:19,770
relationships the kind of relationships

193
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:22,680
we need to enable our team to work

194
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:24,840
together how are we prepared to coach

195
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,979
that team right make sure that we're

196
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,710
staying on track that we're reaching

197
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:30,508
those goals there's a really good book

198
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:33,510
out there by simon Sinek called the

199
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:36,839
infinite game and it talks about this

200
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:39,000
concept of zealots and mercenaries right

201
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:42,930
so what we want to do is foster zealots

202
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,450
we want people that believe in what

203
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:47,819
we're doing if not the mission and the

204
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:49,950
cause at least believe in what the team

205
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,930
is doing day to day believe in that

206
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:53,250
concept of teamwork and being being part

207
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:55,370
of a group something that's bigger than

208
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:57,110
themselves

209
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:58,610
we don't necessarily want to build a

210
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:00,080
team of mercenaries that are only out

211
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:02,900
for themselves right you're gonna take

212
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,480
the paycheck move on as soon as another

213
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:08,270
better opportunity comes along right so

214
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:11,240
foster zealots not mercenaries and above

215
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:14,210
all you know as leaders as defenders as

216
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:16,790
analysts we need to have a readiness to

217
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:20,060
prove ourselves and that doesn't mean

218
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:21,740
that we need to crush ourselves you're

219
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,959
trying to show what we can do and show

220
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:25,640
what we know we need to be ready to

221
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,740
admit that maybe we don't know

222
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,779
everything that there are smarter people

223
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,700
out there that we can learn from each

224
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:34,970
other right so be ready to prove

225
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:38,000
yourself be ready to jump in and you

226
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:39,380
know learn right bring your particular

227
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,330
set of knowledge and skills your

228
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:43,420
background to the table see how you can

229
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:47,300
use that for the betterment of your team

230
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:49,430
so hopefully we all have the right

231
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:52,510
mindset right we're ready to jump in

232
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:55,189
start building that Sokka a-team so

233
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:58,040
first step here and getting started we

234
00:09:55,190 --> 00:10:00,470
need to answer some questions the first

235
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:02,089
question we need to answer is what are

236
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:05,930
we trying to do what is our business

237
00:10:02,089 --> 00:10:08,089
doing I've run into many situations

238
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:11,180
where you have a security team that

239
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:13,370
knows very well what they're supposed to

240
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:16,849
be doing day to day right they know what

241
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:19,880
they're about but they can't for the

242
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:21,770
life of them describe what value their

243
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:24,980
organization creates you know sure maybe

244
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:26,660
I work at a manufacturing company or

245
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:29,089
maybe I work at a government agency and

246
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:31,219
they do X Y & Z you know that's great

247
00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:32,990
but when's the last time if you're a

248
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:35,350
defender that you really dug into what

249
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:38,300
your organization does to create value

250
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:39,680
right what are the big developments that

251
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,300
are on the horizon what things are they

252
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,109
working on what are their competitors

253
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,630
right

254
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:46,670
how can you enable the business to

255
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:48,110
maintain the edge in whatever it is

256
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:51,770
they're doing and allow them to do that

257
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:54,709
in a secure way you have to plan it to

258
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:56,089
experiment and iterate team building can

259
00:10:54,709 --> 00:10:58,339
be very messy interpersonal

260
00:10:56,089 --> 00:11:03,560
relationships with Team Dynamics those

261
00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:05,930
things are are relatively soft so we

262
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,939
have to be ready to experiment with

263
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:09,680
different things different incentives

264
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:12,170
different metrics and measurements and

265
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,699
be prepared to iterate over time I'm a

266
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:17,510
big fan of treating the sock as a

267
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:19,730
platform that you're constantly refining

268
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:22,010
right you're putting out new releases of

269
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:24,860
what the sock is right with different

270
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:27,260
processes different measures you have to

271
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:30,580
be ready to iterate to get the right

272
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:33,370
balance of all those things

273
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:35,960
servant-leadership very very important

274
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:38,890
right for those of you that we're

275
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:41,360
fortunate enough to watch the a-team

276
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:44,689
Hannibal Smith was the leader of the

277
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:47,420
a-team and he wasn't back in some bunker

278
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:48,830
or base directing his team to to do

279
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:50,750
these missions right to try to clear

280
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:51,950
their names and go through all these

281
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,360
event adventures

282
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:56,330
you know from afar he was right there

283
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:59,840
with them and while you might not be a

284
00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:02,260
technical hands-on type of leader right

285
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:06,200
think about how you can enable your team

286
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:10,780
right kind of lead from the front as

287
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:13,520
opposed to sit back and direct from afar

288
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:15,980
how do we show results what metrics are

289
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:17,750
we going to use to demonstrate that

290
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:19,670
we're not just sinking back into that

291
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,500
sustainment mentality right that we're

292
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:22,819
getting somewhere we're going to talk

293
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,460
about that in a little more detail in a

294
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:27,470
few minutes and finally in order for a

295
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:30,830
plan to come together you have to have a

296
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:32,660
plan and the plan can't be we're going

297
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:35,320
to get up and running we're gonna get to

298
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:37,430
where you know we can look at simav ents

299
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,840
to where we can open tickets and

300
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:41,329
escalate them that's great

301
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:44,740
that's also the first step where are you

302
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:44,740
going to go from there what's your plan

303
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:50,510
so now we've got a right mindset we have

304
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,569
our plan right now it's time to build

305
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:56,590
the team and this is a concept that I

306
00:12:53,570 --> 00:13:00,020
like to refer to it is by no means

307
00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:02,030
scientific in any way and it's

308
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:04,189
represented here in two boxes right now

309
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:07,910
pay attention because there's going to

310
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:11,330
be a quiz on this later think of

311
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:14,300
two boxes as two ends of a spectrum the

312
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:16,910
18 that we're going to build in terms of

313
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:19,459
people we can have a talent centric

314
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:23,120
model or we can have a mission centric

315
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:24,710
model right now I'll describe these in

316
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,810
more detail on the next slide but

317
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:28,880
basically your talent centric model is

318
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:31,400
what I like to refer to as super host

319
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,189
hero syndrome so you have one individual

320
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:36,970
or a few individuals that are providing

321
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:39,800
the majority of the technical expertise

322
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:40,760
possibly the majority of the vision for

323
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,709
the team you know what it's supposed to

324
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:45,290
look like how it works and they're

325
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:48,470
really driving what the team is doing on

326
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:50,740
any given day on the other end of the

327
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:53,870
spectrum we have a mission centric model

328
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:58,010
this is a team that's built to fulfill a

329
00:13:53,870 --> 00:14:00,200
certain function and it matters less it

330
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:01,730
still matters but it matters less about

331
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,990
the individuals on the team and what

332
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:04,580
they're driving it's more about

333
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:06,650
organizational drivers what the

334
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:08,060
organization requires so I'm going to

335
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:11,810
describe these now I want you all to

336
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:14,329
think about where your team if you're in

337
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,810
a cyber defense team or a blue team or a

338
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:16,550
sock

339
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:18,619
think about where your team falls in

340
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:20,870
this spectrum which end are you closer

341
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:23,990
to okay now seriously listen to this

342
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:27,050
we're gonna have a quiz right on the

343
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:29,330
talaq centric talat centric sobbing by

344
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:31,670
the way neither of these are right or

345
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:34,610
wrong it's more purchased an observation

346
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:37,640
of Team Dynamics so in a talent centric

347
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:39,350
dynamic that might be where you need to

348
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,210
go if you want to get more capability

349
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:44,480
near-term if you need seasoned

350
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:45,980
experienced defenders to jump in really

351
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:50,990
get going with minimal preparation

352
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:52,940
minimal build-out at the same time your

353
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:56,330
capacity is going to be limited right if

354
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:57,650
you're relying on these rockstars on

355
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:59,660
these superheroes whatever you want to

356
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:02,000
call them you're only going to be able

357
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:04,760
to scale as far as those individuals can

358
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,010
work so your capacity to scale and do

359
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:09,730
lots of different things at once handle

360
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:12,770
heavy workload it's going to be limited

361
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:14,540
bias turnover right become a bigger

362
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:18,319
problem when you're more heavily reliant

363
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:20,390
on a few individuals all right if you

364
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,590
have one person or a few people driving

365
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:23,300
work clothes on your team

366
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:25,700
guess what you're probably going to be

367
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:27,890
focused on what those individuals want

368
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:31,040
to be focused on now on the other other

369
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:33,080
end of the spectrum mission centric

370
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,930
organizations and I don't want to pick

371
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:38,900
on public sector or the federal sector

372
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:41,270
but I often see this in kind of contract

373
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:43,640
driven environments like federal

374
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:46,310
contracts like federal agencies this is

375
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:48,170
where the processes and the team

376
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:50,839
structure and really everything about

377
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:53,360
how the team operates is well defined up

378
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:56,030
front you will do these things you're

379
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,470
gonna monitor these tools when you see

380
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:59,810
something you're gonna escalate it in

381
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:02,060
this way right with these SFA's

382
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:04,849
sometimes this structure can be a lot

383
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:07,520
less flexible it can leave less room for

384
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:09,740
creativity for the team to decide how

385
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:12,910
best to handle you know give an issue a

386
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:16,160
given incident they given failure and

387
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:18,620
not always but often there's a risk of

388
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,439
missing the forest for the trees right

389
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:23,330
sure you might be a very mature

390
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,920
organization if you're very highly

391
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:28,160
structured in this way perhaps

392
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:30,620
structured you know by a contract or by

393
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,560
a statement of work right might be very

394
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:34,910
mature but what I often see in these

395
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,400
types of organizations is they don't

396
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:39,650
have a lot of capability and that kind

397
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,880
of sounds weird to say right but you

398
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:43,069
might have these documents and

399
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,080
repeatable processes but still miss

400
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:47,660
things because you're not enabling your

401
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,850
team to be creative and to break outside

402
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:51,530
of those bounds when needed to do it

403
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:55,310
needs to be done so we'll come back to

404
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:56,900
us in a little bit but regardless of

405
00:16:55,310 --> 00:17:00,050
where you fall in that spectrum or you

406
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:02,449
need to fall when you're building your

407
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:04,730
team you start bringing in your those

408
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:07,190
eight players you want to focus on

409
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:09,170
attracting things like aptitude right

410
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:13,130
the right kind of attitude remember this

411
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:16,310
is a team sport at least it is on the

412
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:19,150
defender side right so we need the right

413
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:21,919
kinds of attitudes to come together

414
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:23,209
operate well as a team the desire has to

415
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,520
be there remember we're looking for

416
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:27,620
zealots not mercenaries we want that

417
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,300
drive that desire to learn to get better

418
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:32,659
right to be creative that's what we're

419
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:34,290
looking for and we need a diverse team

420
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:36,270
and I mean that

421
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:38,460
every sense of the word diversity of

422
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:39,870
thought diversity of backgrounds lots of

423
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:42,750
different types of people lots of

424
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:45,239
different perspectives many many studies

425
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:48,630
shown that indicate that diversity of

426
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,740
thought makes for much better analytic

427
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:54,900
results and that's what we want

428
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:56,400
ringg things we want to avoid this is

429
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,800
one of my favorites I'm sure none of you

430
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:02,180
have opinions on this / Alliance on

431
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:05,220
experience or education or credentials

432
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:07,650
I'm a big fan obviously I teach for sins

433
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:10,260
I believe in what they do I'm a big fan

434
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:12,600
of certifications and training and

435
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:15,740
professional development but we don't

436
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:19,050
want to rely on those to the extent that

437
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:20,580
we lose great candidates right so we

438
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:22,260
don't want to over ally those are good

439
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:25,500
data points they're not the be-all

440
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:27,960
end-all and finding quality people we

441
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,870
need to look out for this keyword and I

442
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:32,550
know no one listening to me right now

443
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:34,050
has an issue with this at all right but

444
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:36,570
for those other people that are not on

445
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:37,560
this talk that have big egos right we

446
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:39,899
need to kind of look out for that

447
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:42,659
because sometimes that can hamper good

448
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:45,120
teamwork okay and misrepresentation

449
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:46,260
again we need all different kinds of

450
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,510
people with all different kinds of

451
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:50,040
backgrounds okay but what we don't need

452
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,450
are folks who are going to come in and

453
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,270
maybe misrepresent what we know right

454
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:55,380
that's not a great starting point so

455
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:57,629
when you're looking for great candidates

456
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:01,800
for building out this team right look

457
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:04,860
out for misrepresentation now I can do

458
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:09,389
an entire talk and in fact there's a

459
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:11,790
whole channel in circle city con right

460
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:13,560
for looking at resumes and helping folks

461
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:17,490
be prepared to go through the interview

462
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:19,169
process but whatever your process is and

463
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:21,240
it can vary greatly from one

464
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:23,610
organization to another right we might

465
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:26,550
not have a lot of control over what that

466
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:31,620
process looks like but one thing that I

467
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:34,290
have found is Universal and most hiring

468
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:36,000
scenarios is we're asking questions

469
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:38,639
right we're trying to get to know people

470
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,320
in a very limited span of time right so

471
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,930
you want to ask the right time types of

472
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,330
questions okay if we want to find these

473
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:47,580
these zealots you know people with the

474
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:50,550
kinds of diverse backgrounds

475
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:51,840
and diversity of thought that we want we

476
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:56,760
have to ask the right kinds of questions

477
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:58,699
and this is this table is taken from an

478
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:00,810
academic paper that was released by

479
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,520
Department of Homeland Security and

480
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:06,149
George Mason University and a few others

481
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:08,040
recently that talked about strong team

482
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:09,930
dynamics in computer instant response

483
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,149
teams and I thought it was a great

484
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:14,250
description of the kinds of questions

485
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:17,340
and the kinds of responses that you want

486
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:20,040
to look for in the hiring process when

487
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:21,689
you're trying to find great people so

488
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:24,990
I'm not going to read this to you you

489
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:27,360
can see it on the screen but you want to

490
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:31,200
ask open-ended kind of scenario oriented

491
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:33,540
questions and these are elements of

492
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,750
strong responses to those questions you

493
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:38,879
want some specificity you want to ask

494
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:40,470
about processes and have you know

495
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,360
candidates be able to describe things in

496
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:44,250
order and understand you know the

497
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:46,229
rationale and it really doesn't matter

498
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:50,070
what those things are right talk to me

499
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:53,490
about how you solved a problem I mean

500
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:55,139
how you built a tool how you responded

501
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:57,810
to an incidents or identified at an

502
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:59,460
incident whatever it is right they need

503
00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:02,389
to express an understanding of the

504
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:04,710
rationale behind doing what they did

505
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:06,900
talk about whether or not they were able

506
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:08,490
to follow that process or maybe where

507
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:11,340
they had to get creative and deviate

508
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:12,620
from that process and why and you know

509
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:15,449
hopefully they can talk to you about

510
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:17,370
things that they identified that they

511
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:19,800
could improve in that process again

512
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:21,899
whatever it is made some red flag

513
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:24,000
responses I don't really know why I did

514
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,770
this or why we do this where I work

515
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,780
today I just kind of follow it blindly

516
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:32,220
and I I don't really get the rationale

517
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:34,710
behind it or real red flag we have a

518
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:37,320
process for analyzing malware but I

519
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:39,570
don't really follow that right I just

520
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,980
it's just it's onerous or you know I

521
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:42,240
don't understand it so I don't do it

522
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:46,140
right when I kind of look out for those

523
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:49,560
things or this process stinks it's

524
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:50,940
terrible if it sucks I don't know how to

525
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,889
improve it I don't really know how we

526
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:54,660
could do it better right problems

527
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:56,340
without solutions those are the kinds of

528
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:58,930
things we want to look out for when

529
00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:01,730
we're screening candidates

530
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:03,890
so if we've navigated that we found our

531
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:06,650
great candidates we're ready to bring

532
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:09,470
the team together start really you know

533
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:13,190
building that capability it's time to

534
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:14,960
think about training and there are lots

535
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:17,890
of great resources out there for

536
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:20,990
professional development and training

537
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:23,120
whatever we're using training is really

538
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:24,020
really important right and it's not

539
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,000
something that we should be doing

540
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:28,610
upfront for a limited amount of time and

541
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,830
then boom we're off to the races it

542
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:33,199
should be an ongoing activity constantly

543
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:37,070
refining our skills refining our ability

544
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:41,260
to work together as a team and in doing

545
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:44,300
that and some of this is based off of

546
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:46,790
the the research and the writings of

547
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:49,820
Chris Sanders who many of you may be

548
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:51,050
familiar with there's a lot of work on

549
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,610
the blue team sides are in a lot of

550
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:55,659
great books publish a lot of great

551
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:59,360
resources does a lot of great training

552
00:22:55,660 --> 00:23:02,030
but you know things like technical

553
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,219
analysis right learning tools things

554
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:09,020
like search syntax right how to write a

555
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:11,870
splint query how to navigate through cue

556
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:13,960
radar or elastic how to use server kata

557
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:16,550
you know those things can all be taught

558
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:19,310
following an SOP can be taught

559
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:21,500
relatively easily right how to write and

560
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:24,889
follow documentation may be a little

561
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:26,240
harder right but it's relatively easy to

562
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:29,420
bring someone up to speed on those

563
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:31,940
things the bigger challenge is teaching

564
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:33,620
things like how to think right

565
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:36,230
metacognition thinking about thinking

566
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:38,080
being aware of your biases how to

567
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:40,220
communicate well with others

568
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,720
investigative theory right what are the

569
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:46,340
business implications of what we're

570
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:48,650
doing again in my experience not in all

571
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:50,209
cases we focus a little bit too much on

572
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:52,490
the things that are easier to teach and

573
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:55,250
less so on the things that are harder to

574
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:56,570
teach because they're hard but it

575
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:58,790
doesn't make them any less important in

576
00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:00,679
fact I think they're much more important

577
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:04,040
these things that are in the right-hand

578
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:05,510
column but on the left okay and as I

579
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,580
mentioned before we want to start with

580
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:09,650
our mission in our business everyone on

581
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:11,659
the team should be able to describe what

582
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:13,430
their Charter is for the

583
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:15,440
what value they're bringing to the

584
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:17,240
business what things are concerned about

585
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,550
at a high level what's the

586
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:21,620
organization's threat model what are the

587
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:24,409
things that could impact that value

588
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:25,550
right what's the environment the larger

589
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:27,290
business environment or the

590
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:29,720
organizational environment that they are

591
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:31,399
operating in you know if you're

592
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:36,980
wondering where to start on the non

593
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:40,720
technical training start there another

594
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:44,390
area that I think we often skip over is

595
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:48,380
collaborative problem solving and this

596
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:50,800
is also from that academic paper the

597
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:55,010
joint academic paper between DHS and GMU

598
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:57,830
and others there was a big focus on the

599
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:59,690
more effective teams training in

600
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:02,810
collaborative problem-solving working

601
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:04,940
together to address issues respond to

602
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:07,010
incidents do security analysis in a

603
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:08,300
collaborative way and these are some

604
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:11,330
things that can strengthen that

605
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:13,940
collaborative problem-solving first

606
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:16,610
thing conducting pre briefings for

607
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:19,250
instant response or structured threat

608
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:21,679
hunts right don't just turn everybody

609
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:23,480
loose and have them go off and do you

610
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:26,470
know whatever it is they're gonna do

611
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:29,240
right in every episode of the a-team

612
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:31,180
there would be kind of a challenge or a

613
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,440
big problem that the team had to solve

614
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:34,790
and sometimes they would go off on their

615
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,980
own and do their own parts of the

616
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:39,260
mission right but inevitably they would

617
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:41,120
come back together right to work as a

618
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:43,730
team to you know

619
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:46,250
blast through that ambush or break out

620
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:49,160
of a barn that they were trapped in or

621
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:50,750
whatever it was right and they didn't

622
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,580
just go off and do that and expect that

623
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:54,560
everyone was gonna handle their piece of

624
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:56,899
it right without some sort of structured

625
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:59,480
conversation and sometimes maybe

626
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:02,120
off-screen but this is what we should be

627
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,680
doing every time the team is gonna go

628
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:06,280
off and do something like an instant

629
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:08,540
response like a structured hunt

630
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:11,149
conducted pre-briefing talked about the

631
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:13,280
goals roles and responsibilities you

632
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:16,340
know issues and risks what we expect the

633
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:19,370
outcomes to be things like that on the

634
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:21,679
back end conduct structured debriefs of

635
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:23,469
everything you found right did any of

636
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,570
those issues pop up

637
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:27,400
we have any challenges right where we do

638
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:29,678
run into any organizational roadblocks

639
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,929
things won't improve unless you're

640
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:35,860
conducting those kinds of reviews after

641
00:26:31,929 --> 00:26:38,520
the fact so you can improve training

642
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:43,389
training training this is something that

643
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:46,000
has been beaten into me from my previous

644
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:47,919
life in the military which is if you're

645
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,929
not on a mission if you're not engaged

646
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,600
then you're training to be engaged

647
00:26:49,929 --> 00:26:54,309
you're training to be on the mission

648
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:57,070
right so to the extent that you can

649
00:26:54,309 --> 00:26:58,418
conduct simulations we've got a great

650
00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:01,720
talk in fact I think one that's

651
00:26:58,419 --> 00:27:04,539
happening right now about purple teaming

652
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:07,450
in doing those kinds of simulations and

653
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:10,090
even if you don't have the resources to

654
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:11,559
do more structured reviews like a purple

655
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:14,199
team or maybe you don't have a red team

656
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:16,780
that you can work with look for ways to

657
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:19,090
walk the team through scenarios you know

658
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:21,789
do some tabletop exercises write up some

659
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:23,740
scenarios and walk the team through

660
00:27:21,789 --> 00:27:26,350
those scenarios verbally if nothing else

661
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:28,900
and make sure you're giving focused

662
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:30,370
feedback to your team members right

663
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:32,950
conduct those one-on-ones

664
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:34,658
when you go through these simulations or

665
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:36,970
when you're doing your debriefs right

666
00:27:34,659 --> 00:27:38,590
you're gonna see that people have

667
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:40,360
challenges right maybe challenges

668
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:42,100
communicating challenges doing some of

669
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:44,080
the technical work make sure you give

670
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:47,289
them that focused feedback early and

671
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,699
often directly one-on-one and then

672
00:27:47,289 --> 00:27:50,440
finally a pro tip when it comes to

673
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:52,990
training no matter what you're doing for

674
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:55,799
training it helps to spend at least some

675
00:27:52,990 --> 00:28:00,010
time training your own people and

676
00:27:55,799 --> 00:28:01,510
letting them train together I've been a

677
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:04,450
part of many teams right and I've

678
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:06,429
assessed many teams where the

679
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:09,700
organization is spending a lot of money

680
00:28:06,429 --> 00:28:12,580
sending individuals off and the thinking

681
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:15,370
is well they'll go off and you know this

682
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:17,740
one person will take this very focused

683
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:19,149
training and they'll come back and kind

684
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:21,280
of share what they know and it'll sort

685
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:23,650
of you know by osmosis kind of spread

686
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:25,570
out to the team and in my experience

687
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:27,429
that doesn't really work you have to

688
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:29,439
spend some time letting the team train

689
00:28:27,429 --> 00:28:32,070
together in order for them to build up

690
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,070
that shared knowledge

691
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:37,490
got a really highly trained team right

692
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:39,860
we've got the right personalities we've

693
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:41,510
got it's really good kind of diversity

694
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:43,580
lots of different perspectives on the

695
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:46,250
team we're starting to come together and

696
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:48,620
function as a group so how do we keep

697
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:50,600
everybody motivated how do we keep

698
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:52,459
everybody on the job right it is a

699
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:54,649
competitive landscape out there even now

700
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:57,620
right where a lot of people are getting

701
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:59,480
impacted by kind of the downturn and

702
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:01,219
everything that's happening some people

703
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:05,510
are getting laid off right there's still

704
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:07,040
it's still a competitive sector so how

705
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:08,450
do we motivate people and try to keep

706
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,580
you know the good folks that we've had

707
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:14,810
that we have that we've made all of

708
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:16,340
these investments in first up we want to

709
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:18,560
keep you know a little bit of healthy

710
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:22,250
competition can be a great thing and it

711
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:24,500
can be a great motivator but we also

712
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:26,810
want to build this kind of no

713
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:29,150
competition zone right we're all a team

714
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:31,190
at the end of the day it's not about you

715
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:33,080
know who is doing better than whom who

716
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:35,590
did what right everything's a team

717
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:38,919
effort so we need to foster that sort of

718
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:41,179
collaborative no competition zone I

719
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:43,420
talked about the super hero syndrome

720
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:45,470
ranked that talent centric model and

721
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:46,970
sometimes that's necessary I'm gonna

722
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:50,660
talk about some case studies in a few

723
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:53,690
minutes where I personally kind of had

724
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:56,450
to go that talent centric route to get

725
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:58,850
the results that I wanted but that's not

726
00:29:56,450 --> 00:30:01,790
great for long-term retention because

727
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:03,889
when that talent inevitably moves on it

728
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:05,600
takes another opportunity your

729
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:07,970
capability is gonna crater that's gonna

730
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,070
have a huge impact so shifting tasks

731
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:11,990
around letting people cross train occupy

732
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:15,020
different roles even if that's temporary

733
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:18,370
it's a great way to hero proof your

734
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:20,750
organization your team on the 18

735
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:22,459
everybody had their specialties you had

736
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:24,650
team members that were really good at

737
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:26,300
building things right or destroying

738
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:29,060
things you had team members that were

739
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:30,770
great at social engineering team members

740
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:32,990
that were great at planning it was a

741
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:36,020
pilot right lots of different skill sets

742
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:38,890
but they were all able to in some cases

743
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:41,180
switch and kind of do each other's job

744
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:44,650
right and they were a stronger team for

745
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:48,400
it celebrate small wins

746
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:49,630
so so much of what we do in running and

747
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:52,510
building and being part of security

748
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:55,270
teams I know you all are gonna be sad to

749
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:57,850
hear it I'm kind of sad to say it it's a

750
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:59,950
sales job all right we have to sell what

751
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:01,419
we're doing sometimes to our own team

752
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:04,030
you have to so what we're doing

753
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:05,710
certainly to management to stakeholders

754
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:07,120
that are footing the bills for what

755
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:09,700
we're doing right so we need to

756
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:12,459
celebrate those small wins did we add a

757
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:14,830
new capability did we drive some of our

758
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:17,410
metrics further into the area that we

759
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:18,909
want them to be we need to look for

760
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:22,870
opportunities to sell what we're doing

761
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:24,310
celebrate those wins I have talked about

762
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:26,290
collaboration and creativity several

763
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:28,120
times already but we need to look for

764
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:31,120
ways to promote that and if you're not

765
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:34,000
doing that in a purposeful structured

766
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:36,520
way it's really easy once that

767
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,280
empowerment once that creativity starts

768
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:41,110
to falter it's gonna gain momentum and

769
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,550
it's gonna be much harder to reintroduce

770
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:46,169
that back into the team if you're not

771
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:48,250
maintaining it talking about empowering

772
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:50,710
we have to make sure that we're

773
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:54,630
empowering and equipping our team to do

774
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:58,960
what's important there's this concept

775
00:31:54,630 --> 00:32:01,810
called and named after Dwight Eisenhower

776
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,160
it's called Eisenhower matrix and if you

777
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:04,330
were to look up the Eisenhower matrix I

778
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:07,030
don't have a picture in here but it's a

779
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:11,199
way of organizing tasks into things that

780
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:13,149
are urgent and important and some tasks

781
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,040
might be very important but they're not

782
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:18,460
particularly urgent some tasks might be

783
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:21,970
urgent but not particularly important so

784
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:23,670
for example if you're one of your

785
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:28,030
responsibilities on the security team is

786
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:30,610
monitoring the spam inbox and I do often

787
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:36,010
see that weirdly in security teams as

788
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:37,810
monitoring spam that might not be

789
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:40,300
particularly important but maybe you

790
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:42,220
have an SLA around taking some action

791
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:43,510
right to monitor that so that is

792
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:45,820
something that is urgent not

793
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:49,660
particularly important okay and what we

794
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:51,790
want to do as leaders right even you

795
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:54,190
know if we're a part of a larger team we

796
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:55,899
want to try to drive towards focusing on

797
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:57,420
things that are important even if

798
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:59,040
they're not urgent right keep as

799
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:01,800
much of our attention as many of our

800
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:03,960
resources on those things as we can and

801
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:06,800
it can be difficult because as we all

802
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:10,470
know insecurity everything's urgent

803
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:12,360
right so we have to try to empower our

804
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:16,650
team to work through that focus on what

805
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:18,149
is not only urgent but is important so

806
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:20,250
how do we measure what we're doing I

807
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:23,610
mean you can't manage what you can't

808
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:25,140
measure and this happens to be kind of a

809
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:29,399
favorite topic of mine in security

810
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:31,920
operations because I'm a nerd key

811
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,900
performance indicators and a

812
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:36,480
lesser-known

813
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:40,470
type of metric objectives and key

814
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:42,810
results ok ours so most of us if you're

815
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:45,240
part of a security team you've got KPIs

816
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:48,060
to instrument your operation whether

817
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:50,970
that's you know time-based metrics how

818
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:52,379
you're doing how what are the numbers

819
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:54,480
and types of incidents that you're

820
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:56,130
responding to how many changes you're

821
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,480
making in the environment you know

822
00:33:56,130 --> 00:34:00,810
things like that they instrument your

823
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:04,110
operation on a day to day basis ok ours

824
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:06,990
which I think were pioneered at Intel

825
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:10,139
many years ago they tie your operations

826
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:13,679
to a larger strategy so what are our

827
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:15,779
strategic objectives things that we want

828
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,730
to do and what are the key results we

829
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:21,260
have to see in order to reach those

830
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:23,760
objectives ok

831
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:25,530
how will your training and your

832
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,450
mentorship that you're doing drive

833
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:28,650
improvements in these areas right

834
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:31,529
everything that you're doing

835
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:33,480
should improve your KPIs and if you have

836
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:36,060
ok ours they should improve those as

837
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:37,918
well so let's talk about those in a

838
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:39,960
little bit more detail so sample KPI is

839
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:43,168
again most of us have this kind of thing

840
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:45,630
in our security teams right some some

841
00:34:43,168 --> 00:34:47,790
examples might be you know coverage

842
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:49,620
right here your visibility for

843
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:51,600
monitoring it might be your time to

844
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:54,929
respond remediate or containing

845
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:57,720
intrusions if you wanted to introduce ok

846
00:34:54,929 --> 00:35:00,240
ours into your measurements some

847
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:02,850
examples might be you know a strategic

848
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,799
objective of our security team is we

849
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:07,020
want to reduce successful social

850
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,619
engineering attacks all right so how do

851
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:11,140
we do that

852
00:35:08,619 --> 00:35:14,259
what sure what KPI is do we need to be

853
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:16,479
seeing to bring you know successful

854
00:35:14,259 --> 00:35:19,479
social engineering attacks kind of back

855
00:35:16,479 --> 00:35:21,129
into the range that we want to see right

856
00:35:19,479 --> 00:35:22,569
hopefully at zero probably won't ever

857
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:28,019
get there but what is an acceptable

858
00:35:22,569 --> 00:35:30,640
level maybe want to maybe want to reduce

859
00:35:28,019 --> 00:35:33,549
identification and response time right

860
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:35,769
so that is a point in time finite goal

861
00:35:33,549 --> 00:35:38,650
we want to get it down to you know this

862
00:35:35,769 --> 00:35:40,479
time or less so let's focus on that

863
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:43,269
right

864
00:35:40,479 --> 00:35:46,569
okay ours right can be used to bring

865
00:35:43,269 --> 00:35:49,808
those KPIs into the desired range right

866
00:35:46,569 --> 00:35:58,719
we want to get time to respond down to

867
00:35:49,809 --> 00:36:03,519
zero or you know down to whatever so

868
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:05,950
let's see when we're measuring people if

869
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:08,738
you listened to Alyssa's

870
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:11,229
keynote yesterday you heard her talk

871
00:36:08,739 --> 00:36:13,839
about you know using fear uncertainty

872
00:36:11,229 --> 00:36:15,249
and doubt food to communicate issues to

873
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:17,229
management and how that doesn't really

874
00:36:15,249 --> 00:36:19,058
work it's not a good motivator so

875
00:36:17,229 --> 00:36:20,319
similarly when you're measuring your

876
00:36:19,059 --> 00:36:23,499
people and you're trying to motivate

877
00:36:20,319 --> 00:36:26,259
them right we want to inform we want to

878
00:36:23,499 --> 00:36:29,529
empower right not penalized that doesn't

879
00:36:26,259 --> 00:36:31,420
mean you don't correct issues when you

880
00:36:29,529 --> 00:36:33,789
see them it doesn't mean you don't

881
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:37,239
enforce good discipline when you need to

882
00:36:33,789 --> 00:36:38,650
but we don't want to build assembly

883
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:40,660
lines that's not what we're doing here

884
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:43,719
right remember this is an expert kind of

885
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:47,229
task so we want to look for you know

886
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:51,069
measurements goals metrics that motivate

887
00:36:47,229 --> 00:36:53,680
and that measure not penalize we want to

888
00:36:51,069 --> 00:36:56,109
prepare our team members for future

889
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:58,509
success right prepare them to handle

890
00:36:56,109 --> 00:37:00,308
change so they're going to be lots of

891
00:36:58,509 --> 00:37:01,869
organizational changes that as the

892
00:37:00,309 --> 00:37:03,969
security team we're not going to have

893
00:37:01,869 --> 00:37:06,670
control over right mergers and

894
00:37:03,969 --> 00:37:09,069
acquisitions budget changes things that

895
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:11,979
are going to impact us and we need to be

896
00:37:09,069 --> 00:37:14,288
prepared for that so if we lose our

897
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:16,899
fancy new tool that everybody loves and

898
00:37:14,289 --> 00:37:19,719
we have to make do with some other

899
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:22,370
lesser alternative we still have to be

900
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:24,350
able to do our jobs and be successful

901
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:27,020
so think about that when you're planning

902
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:29,330
your training what you're gonna focus on

903
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:32,000
when you're planning out your SOPs and

904
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:34,970
how the team works and above all you

905
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,520
know everything changes right semper

906
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:41,240
Gumby prepare to be flexible prepare

907
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:43,600
your team to handle change so I've

908
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:45,950
mentioned in this paper a few times from

909
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:47,990
DHS and George Mason University and

910
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:49,609
several other groups that paper is

911
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:51,589
improving social maturity of

912
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:53,600
cybersecurity instant response teams and

913
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:55,700
if you're in any kind of leadership or

914
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,200
management role highly recommend you

915
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:59,540
read that it's a great paper there's

916
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:03,020
lots of good stuff in there but now I

917
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:05,029
want to take a few minutes to talk about

918
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:07,040
challenges that we're gonna run into and

919
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:08,960
the first set of challenges are

920
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:12,440
described in this paper they're called

921
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:14,960
collaboration chillers and that might

922
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:17,300
sound like you know the new Mountain Dew

923
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,700
flavor I don't know how much I like that

924
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:22,970
phrase but I think the concept is really

925
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:25,430
sound right look through this list if

926
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:28,220
you're on a security team and count how

927
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:30,919
many of these things you have in your

928
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:34,520
team or you've seen as a problem failure

929
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:35,750
to share information not initiating

930
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:38,420
collaboration just kind of staying

931
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:40,400
focused head down right doing what we're

932
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:42,290
doing focused on our own stuff not

933
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:45,230
really looking to bring other people in

934
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:47,870
or enable others not adapting to change

935
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:51,340
we just talked about that not

936
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:53,569
communicating not trusting our teammates

937
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:55,250
interpersonal conflicts right those are

938
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:57,110
gonna be natural in any kind of team

939
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:59,600
environment so that's gonna be a

940
00:38:57,110 --> 00:39:01,730
challenge no matter what lack of

941
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:03,410
knowledge about team member expertise I

942
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:05,560
want to talk about this a little bit

943
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:09,319
more depth write this paper also

944
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:12,920
introduces the concept of SKU shared

945
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:14,720
knowledge of unique expertise and I've

946
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:18,860
seen this problem a lot in security

947
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:21,290
teams I've never heard it given a name

948
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:24,650
like this so I really like this concept

949
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:28,160
you know we want to foster and improve

950
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:31,790
you know skew this shared knowledge of

951
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:33,170
who knows what right so you should be up

952
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:35,180
look at your team and every team member

953
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:36,160
should be able to look around and say if

954
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:38,859
I have an issue

955
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:41,049
with you know this type of malware or I

956
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:43,360
have an issue that is specific to

957
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:46,510
Windows environments or Linux

958
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:47,710
environments or I have an issue you know

959
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:49,870
kind of bringing vulnerability

960
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:52,900
management you know kind of into where

961
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:55,089
we need it to be who has expertise in

962
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:57,310
those areas who has background in those

963
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:59,470
areas where is that unique expertise and

964
00:39:57,310 --> 00:40:02,140
how do I tap into it right this is gonna

965
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:04,990
require knowledge tools right if you

966
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:06,400
have a wiki a knowledgebase you know

967
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:08,379
some kind of knowledge management system

968
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,680
right this is where those things come in

969
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:13,330
I mentioned - task shifting and

970
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,830
cross-training this is where that is

971
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:16,750
really important because those skills

972
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:19,060
are gonna come out right people are

973
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:21,010
gonna be more aware of the knowledge

974
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:22,690
gaps that we have and how different

975
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:24,880
teammates can come in and fill those

976
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:27,580
gaps and I also talked about those

977
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:30,130
action app after-action reviews right

978
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:33,400
incredibly important hey we missed this

979
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:35,260
you know we kind of stumbled on doing

980
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:37,480
some of this you know static analysis of

981
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:39,550
the sample but hey so-and-so over here

982
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,990
actually it was really good at that and

983
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:42,910
we should have gotten that sample to

984
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:47,799
so-and-so you know much faster things

985
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:49,600
like that some other challenges that

986
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:52,660
we're gonna run into building our a team

987
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:55,750
and inward focus again I'm sure no one

988
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:58,270
on this stream has a problem with this

989
00:40:55,750 --> 00:41:00,820
right focusing only on what we do or

990
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:02,770
what our team does right at the expense

991
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:06,160
of what's going on around us I'm sure

992
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:08,050
none of us have that challenge but it is

993
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,549
out there some teams do run into this so

994
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:13,420
you gotta look out for that role

995
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:16,390
oriented bias I have an Intel background

996
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:19,140
so now everything to me is an Intel

997
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:21,819
problem okay that's that's pretty common

998
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:23,379
especially if you have scenarios where

999
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:27,340
individuals are specialized in different

1000
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:29,380
areas conflict lack of trust lack of

1001
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:31,830
empowerment nothing will kill a team

1002
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:34,840
faster even a very highly skilled team

1003
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:36,940
then a lack of empowerment to do things

1004
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:38,770
right to take action to respond to

1005
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:43,540
something they're seeing I mean to make

1006
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:46,920
sure folks are empowered here's what you

1007
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:50,759
can do to address these issues first

1008
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:53,069
right not everyone is is social not

1009
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:56,099
everyone is extroverted or outgoing and

1010
00:41:53,069 --> 00:41:56,369
that's fine but to the extent that you

1011
00:41:56,099 --> 00:41:58,380
can

1012
00:41:56,369 --> 00:42:01,619
you gotta foster interaction and social

1013
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:03,480
connections of some kind right even if

1014
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:05,819
it's leading a you know kind of

1015
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:08,490
non-work-related discussion you know a

1016
00:42:05,819 --> 00:42:09,779
slack channel or discord channel for non

1017
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:11,250
work stuff

1018
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:12,720
you know where people can kind of talk

1019
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:13,700
about things right get to know each

1020
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:17,910
other a little better

1021
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:19,618
set and communicate clear goals clear

1022
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:21,598
roles clear standards we talked about

1023
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:24,270
having a plan make sure the team knows

1024
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:27,119
what that plan is that the team knows

1025
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:28,710
how well that their they're doing to

1026
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:34,170
achieve those goals right to execute

1027
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:34,829
that plan you all as leaders in whatever

1028
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:37,230
you're doing

1029
00:42:34,829 --> 00:42:39,390
on the defensive side you need to

1030
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:41,400
exemplify these communication norms

1031
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:45,299
right so create a safe space for

1032
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:47,030
communication they share often right be

1033
00:42:45,299 --> 00:42:50,819
transparent as transparent as possible

1034
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:52,589
you are going to set the tone for the

1035
00:42:50,819 --> 00:42:54,089
culture within your team right so

1036
00:42:52,589 --> 00:42:58,319
consider that when you're making

1037
00:42:54,089 --> 00:43:01,020
decisions and we talked about doing

1038
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:03,270
exercises simulations you know purple

1039
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:04,349
teaming tabletops things like that you

1040
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:06,780
got to push the team out of their

1041
00:43:04,349 --> 00:43:09,180
comfort zone not too far not all the

1042
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:11,970
time but people are at their most

1043
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:13,259
creative and they feel most empowered

1044
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:16,230
when they're learning new things where

1045
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:17,549
they're slightly pushed outside of you

1046
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:19,200
know their their background their

1047
00:43:17,549 --> 00:43:21,480
skillset and what they're used to doing

1048
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:23,430
that helps maintain that flexibility

1049
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:25,740
helps people grow and learn and that's

1050
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:28,589
what we're all about so I'm going to

1051
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:31,740
round out the talk today just by sharing

1052
00:43:28,589 --> 00:43:33,089
some anecdotes from my experience that

1053
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:34,890
touch on some of the things that we've

1054
00:43:33,089 --> 00:43:37,290
talked about building you know these a

1055
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:39,299
teams I'm going to talk about how I have

1056
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:41,750
tried to build my own a teams in some

1057
00:43:39,299 --> 00:43:48,150
cases very successfully in some cases

1058
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:51,119
learned a lot starting with back in 2008

1059
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:52,890
I was brought in to build a 24/7

1060
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:54,660
security operation center for the

1061
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:56,098
executive branch if you stare really

1062
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:58,589
closely at the slide you might see a

1063
00:43:56,099 --> 00:44:00,690
hint you know or her what I was saying

1064
00:43:58,589 --> 00:44:02,940
earlier at

1065
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:06,150
about where this was but had to bail out

1066
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:08,849
the 24 by 7 sock some of the challenges

1067
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:11,540
coming right in very small budget for

1068
00:44:08,849 --> 00:44:14,460
this agency so despite its visibility

1069
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:16,980
this agency had a very small operating

1070
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:20,160
budget because it was small

1071
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:23,250
organizationally it was an organization

1072
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:25,440
in flux so again this was 2008 it was

1073
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:28,349
about a month before the administration

1074
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:32,250
was transitioning from one to the other

1075
00:44:28,349 --> 00:44:33,540
so lots of changes if you're familiar at

1076
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:35,910
all with the executive branch you know

1077
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:38,790
that the presidential Records Act

1078
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:41,578
dictates that at the end of it of an

1079
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:43,859
administration every piece of data

1080
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:47,910
that's every hard drive every document

1081
00:44:43,859 --> 00:44:51,029
everything is gathered collected and

1082
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:54,118
sent off to National Archives and we

1083
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:55,500
basically start from scratch right so a

1084
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:57,270
lot of stuff happening not just

1085
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:59,520
organizationally but also from a data

1086
00:44:57,270 --> 00:45:00,990
and information perspective and this was

1087
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:03,599
a brand new sock

1088
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:05,759
this agency did not have any kind of

1089
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:08,910
security operations capability basically

1090
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:13,500
had a couple of federal employees that

1091
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:16,020
were effectively their security team so

1092
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:17,460
one other challenge that I didn't

1093
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:19,790
mention on the previous slide as well as

1094
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:23,760
I was the last person to be brought in

1095
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:26,849
so I was handed my team I was handed my

1096
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:30,140
tool sets I was handed my contract I was

1097
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:33,510
a contractor meeting a contract team so

1098
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:35,129
not a lot of chances or opportunity to

1099
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:37,740
be creative be flexible what we were

1100
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:40,530
doing it's kind of given the team given

1101
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:42,450
the capability and told ok you know go

1102
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:47,190
do this with these people and these

1103
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:49,290
tools so how did I build this sock a

1104
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:51,060
team out of you know being handed a lot

1105
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:53,220
of these things that may or may not have

1106
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:56,190
been you know purpose-built for

1107
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:58,500
functions let's just say the first thing

1108
00:45:56,190 --> 00:46:01,349
that I learned very quickly is that we

1109
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:02,640
had a very very savvy customer so the

1110
00:46:01,349 --> 00:46:04,710
federal employees that I was working for

1111
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,660
at the time were really sharp they're

1112
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:09,420
very technical they had had some

1113
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:12,000
incident activity in the past and had

1114
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:13,960
handled that they had built out their

1115
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,880
entire security stack so

1116
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:20,770
very very capable they knew what was

1117
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:22,450
going on so we had to you know work hard

1118
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:24,880
to come tell stories that interested

1119
00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:27,850
them so hey we really got our sin

1120
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:30,100
you know tuned really well and you know

1121
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:31,600
good signal-to-noise ratio

1122
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:34,509
we've got our case management you know

1123
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:36,700
kind of an order right that's all good

1124
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:39,550
that wasn't the most exciting thing to

1125
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:41,680
them right so we had to adopt very

1126
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:43,450
quickly a more Intel oriented focus

1127
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,980
right talk about things like

1128
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:47,410
state-sponsored activities that were

1129
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:50,590
maybe impacting other similar agencies

1130
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:54,040
or this agency we looked at VIPs that

1131
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:55,870
were being targeted this agency has a

1132
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:58,750
lot of sub agencies where they're

1133
00:46:55,870 --> 00:47:00,670
sending VIPs all over the world so you

1134
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:03,040
know they're kind of threat profile is

1135
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:04,630
is very very unique in that sense so we

1136
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:09,970
kind of tailor the program to focus on

1137
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:11,230
some of those unique challenges we also

1138
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:14,169
had to be very focused on the customer

1139
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:16,720
so the new administration coming in at

1140
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:18,820
the time was kind of uh pending a lot of

1141
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:21,879
the norms around how this organization

1142
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:24,370
functioned relative to things like

1143
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:26,620
social media and you know being visible

1144
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:28,779
visible and engaging with the public

1145
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:31,350
right and so we had to build kind of an

1146
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:34,840
tailor what we had technology-wise

1147
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:38,500
around those use cases so a big example

1148
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:40,690
of that is Facebook at the time was a

1149
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:43,630
huge mechanism for engaging with the

1150
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:45,520
public and previously had been just

1151
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:46,810
completely blocked right so we had to

1152
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,610
figure out kind of how to creatively

1153
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:51,009
enable the access that the

1154
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:54,070
administration users wanted without

1155
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:55,680
compromising some of the things that we

1156
00:47:54,070 --> 00:47:59,380
had to do from a privacy and security

1157
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:01,990
and data retention perspective one thing

1158
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:03,460
that I learned here in trying to build a

1159
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:08,140
high-performing team in this kind of

1160
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:10,660
environment is we often think as

1161
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:13,150
security practitioners that were smarter

1162
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:15,490
than everybody in the room I mean not

1163
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:18,070
everybody on this talk right but other

1164
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:20,620
people certainly sometimes think that

1165
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:23,650
right that's not always gonna be the

1166
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:25,330
case in some cases your customer you

1167
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:27,099
know they brought you there right they

1168
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:29,410
know maybe much better than

1169
00:48:27,099 --> 00:48:31,269
you do what the tools are what the

1170
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:33,549
mission is right with where the the

1171
00:48:31,269 --> 00:48:36,038
bodies are buried so to speak so you

1172
00:48:33,549 --> 00:48:38,140
have to find ways to be air quotes

1173
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:39,489
smarter than your customer right in

1174
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:41,650
order to bring value to them what are

1175
00:48:39,489 --> 00:48:43,630
some insights some things that you and

1176
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:45,249
your team can do right to bring value to

1177
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:46,630
the organization that is not there

1178
00:48:45,249 --> 00:48:48,308
before and it's not always going to be

1179
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:52,749
well we're really smart we know things

1180
00:48:48,309 --> 00:48:56,499
about security second case study fast

1181
00:48:52,749 --> 00:48:59,890
forward a few years and I was part of an

1182
00:48:56,499 --> 00:49:01,269
organization that did a lot of fret

1183
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:03,999
hunting and instant response in

1184
00:49:01,269 --> 00:49:04,868
forensics type consulting work and our

1185
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:07,868
customers

1186
00:49:04,869 --> 00:49:10,319
this was back around 2012 our customers

1187
00:49:07,869 --> 00:49:13,390
were clamoring for some kind of ongoing

1188
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:16,239
managed service kind of augmentation not

1189
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:18,129
in the traditional MSP sense but they

1190
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:21,039
wanted kind of this threat hunting as a

1191
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:23,710
service so we built out a managed

1192
00:49:21,039 --> 00:49:26,710
service which one or two years after the

1193
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:28,539
fact I think Gartner coined the phrase

1194
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:31,509
MDR managed detection and response

1195
00:49:28,539 --> 00:49:33,099
provider but before that was really much

1196
00:49:31,509 --> 00:49:36,279
of a thing we built out this early

1197
00:49:33,099 --> 00:49:38,769
service to provide that kind of expert

1198
00:49:36,279 --> 00:49:41,140
support to customers on a monthly a

1199
00:49:38,769 --> 00:49:42,968
sustained basis so we had very clear

1200
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:45,308
goals what we wanted to do with a

1201
00:49:42,969 --> 00:49:49,329
service like this we didn't have a lot

1202
00:49:45,309 --> 00:49:50,979
of processes so we had to bring in kind

1203
00:49:49,329 --> 00:49:52,029
of an expert team to just make things

1204
00:49:50,979 --> 00:49:54,339
happen really fast

1205
00:49:52,029 --> 00:49:56,259
so remember I talked about that talent

1206
00:49:54,339 --> 00:49:59,140
centric model versus the mission centric

1207
00:49:56,259 --> 00:50:01,119
model so in the previous case study that

1208
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:03,460
executive branch agency that was very

1209
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:05,859
much a mission centric model we had to

1210
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:08,140
do what that customer wanted in the way

1211
00:50:05,859 --> 00:50:10,960
that they wanted it done right with very

1212
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:12,788
little deviation okay so that was very

1213
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:16,239
much a mystic mission centric type of

1214
00:50:12,789 --> 00:50:18,969
environment here was almost the opposite

1215
00:50:16,239 --> 00:50:21,549
type of scenario there really wasn't a

1216
00:50:18,969 --> 00:50:24,130
lot of structure there were no kind of

1217
00:50:21,549 --> 00:50:26,109
guardrails there was nothing that came

1218
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:30,489
before that told us how this kind of

1219
00:50:26,109 --> 00:50:32,979
thing would work so my strategy here was

1220
00:50:30,489 --> 00:50:34,509
to adopt that talent centric kind of

1221
00:50:32,979 --> 00:50:37,960
focus make sure that I just had really

1222
00:50:34,509 --> 00:50:40,140
really good capable smart people to get

1223
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:42,690
in and do quality work and then bill

1224
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:44,129
structure around that kind of building

1225
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:47,760
the plane as it's going down the runway

1226
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:49,440
so to speak so the way that we attacked

1227
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,630
this problem and grew our customer base

1228
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:54,590
and ultimately made made this MDR

1229
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:58,440
offerings successful is starting small

1230
00:50:54,590 --> 00:51:00,390
again looking for those quick wins right

1231
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:02,400
fine good fishing holes right good good

1232
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:04,830
ways of fret hunting and finding

1233
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,540
compelling things in these customer

1234
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:09,090
environments and then building from

1235
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:11,070
there and building up really strong

1236
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:13,380
supporting functions like research and

1237
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:15,810
development project management trying to

1238
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:17,940
add some of the structure bring us away

1239
00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:19,970
from being so heavily reliant on a

1240
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:23,370
handful of really talented individuals

1241
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:25,500
and finding a way to achieve more

1242
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:31,190
maturity more kind of reliable

1243
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:35,220
repeatable successes so in this example

1244
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:37,320
my 18 looked like a bunch of great

1245
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:40,859
utility players that could do a lot of

1246
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:42,660
different things and do them well I also

1247
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:44,370
needed them to be really good

1248
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:46,620
communicators right we were talking to

1249
00:51:44,370 --> 00:51:48,720
external customers a lot and in some

1250
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:50,910
cases having conversations that we'd

1251
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:53,430
never had before so good communication

1252
00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:54,629
skills was very important here good

1253
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:57,690
customer support skills from very

1254
00:51:54,630 --> 00:52:00,480
important and ultimately we needed to

1255
00:51:57,690 --> 00:52:03,360
foster a generative environment so we

1256
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:06,240
all you know physically worked in the

1257
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:09,090
same room very open kind of

1258
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:10,080
communications a lot of team building a

1259
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:13,650
lot of bringing the team together

1260
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:16,670
outside of the office and you know doing

1261
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:18,900
a lot of structured activities to build

1262
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:21,120
that collaborative and generative

1263
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:23,130
environment where everybody hopefully

1264
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:25,190
you know felt comfortable bringing up

1265
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:26,910
new ideas new ways of doing things hey

1266
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:28,470
you know we haven't really thought about

1267
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:30,149
this but I'm seeing it with a lot of my

1268
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:32,730
customers you know let's build something

1269
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:34,950
to to address you know that challenge

1270
00:52:32,730 --> 00:52:40,670
right fostering new ideas really really

1271
00:52:34,950 --> 00:52:43,950
really important in that environment so

1272
00:52:40,670 --> 00:52:46,280
to summarize when our plan comes

1273
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:48,089
together right we love when that happens

1274
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:50,880
talent can be found in a lot of

1275
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:53,070
different places and it's less important

1276
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:55,080
where those places are

1277
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:57,390
we don't want to be very narrow-minded

1278
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:59,970
and how we look for it but when we find

1279
00:52:57,390 --> 00:53:03,980
it we want to know that we have it how

1280
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:07,529
to identify how to foster it retain it

1281
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:09,270
ultimately difference between an a team

1282
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:11,370
and the other team right is gonna be

1283
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:13,050
these things how well the team works

1284
00:53:11,370 --> 00:53:15,180
together cohesion how flexible it is

1285
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:17,310
right how resilient in the face of

1286
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:19,109
change and you want to be able to see

1287
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:22,080
measurable results right the proof is

1288
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:23,400
gonna be in the pudding how well is the

1289
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:25,049
team executing its mission

1290
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,190
are we getting where we need to go are

1291
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:28,350
we staying out of that kind of

1292
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:29,910
sustainment rut or we're just sort of

1293
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:32,940
doing the same things day in the day out

1294
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:35,370
and here are some other resources that

1295
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:38,100
if you're focused on your building and

1296
00:53:35,370 --> 00:53:41,009
leading teams that I find to be very

1297
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:46,080
useful I would be remiss if I did not

1298
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:47,490
plug sands SEC 450 which I think of

1299
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:49,500
course I'm very biased but I think it's

1300
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:52,890
a fantastic course if you're able if you

1301
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:54,360
have the means to take it a lot of great

1302
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:56,580
information even if you've been working

1303
00:53:54,360 --> 00:54:00,630
on the blue team for a long time

1304
00:53:56,580 --> 00:54:01,890
there's also Sands Management 551 which

1305
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:04,410
is another course written by John

1306
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:07,710
Hubbard who wrote 450 as well

1307
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:09,779
15 551 is in beta it's a two-day course

1308
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:11,520
on building and leading Sox some some

1309
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:13,710
really great content there really

1310
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:16,830
anything written by Chris Sanders are

1311
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:19,410
produced by him you cannot go wrong any

1312
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:20,790
of his books on security operations he

1313
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:24,120
also did all it's a lot of really great

1314
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:26,040
research and writing on the intersection

1315
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:27,950
between psychology and security

1316
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:30,480
operations which are really fantastic

1317
00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:32,490
there are a lot of free resources out

1318
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:34,560
there in the Sox Summit presentation

1319
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:36,359
archive that sands maintains a lot of

1320
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:39,299
great presentations papers there and

1321
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:41,690
then finally this is getting to be

1322
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:44,240
somewhat of an oldie but still a goodie

1323
00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:46,860
miters ten strategies for building

1324
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:50,759
world-class security on cyber operations

1325
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:52,740
is a free ebook that's out there that

1326
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:55,020
although it's a few years old at this

1327
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:57,680
point I think is still a great resource

1328
00:54:55,020 --> 00:55:00,120
very relevant to building running teams

1329
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:04,290
so I told you that there was going to be

1330
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:06,720
a quiz on the talent centric and mission

1331
00:55:04,290 --> 00:55:11,520
centric fortunately for you all it is

1332
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:14,459
take-home quiz so that pop quiz is your

1333
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:16,830
team more talent centric or is it more

1334
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:17,940
mission centric think about that and

1335
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:19,950
when you answer that question and think

1336
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:21,960
about whether or not that's what you

1337
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:24,629
really need and whether or not that's

1338
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:26,609
the best fit for your organization and

1339
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:29,099
if the answer is no you know what can

1340
00:55:26,609 --> 00:55:30,960
you do to bring it more in the other

1341
00:55:29,099 --> 00:55:32,700
direction make sure you schedule

1342
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:35,790
one-on-ones with your team if you don't

1343
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:37,618
do that go in on Monday morning or log

1344
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:41,009
on a Monday morning and do that right

1345
00:55:37,619 --> 00:55:42,420
away it's very very important when when

1346
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:44,460
you're doing those one-on-ones ask your

1347
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:46,800
team members to talk about SOT Charter

1348
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:48,270
what they're protecting and then look

1349
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:50,270
for ways to remove some of the barriers

1350
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:52,140
navigate the challenges we talked about

1351
00:55:50,270 --> 00:55:55,020
that stand in the way of good

1352
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:56,848
communications good teamwork and find an

1353
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:58,800
opportunity conduct a structured

1354
00:55:56,849 --> 00:56:01,320
pre-briefing whether that's just for an

1355
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:04,290
exercise or a scenario based simulation

1356
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:06,240
or if you have an incident pop up or a

1357
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:08,460
case that you're working try doing a

1358
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:10,348
more structured activity to you know

1359
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:13,830
foster that open communication and that

1360
00:56:10,349 --> 00:56:17,130
teamwork and finally let's keep in touch

1361
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:19,619
