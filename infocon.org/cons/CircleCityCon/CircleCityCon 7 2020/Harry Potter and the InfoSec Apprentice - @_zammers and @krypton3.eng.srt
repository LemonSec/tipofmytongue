14
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:43,750
other side stories if you don't know the

15
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:48,949
books we will be spoiling them for today

16
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:51,410
you have now been warned hi there I'm

17
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:53,030
Sanders I'm a Ravenclaw so I like doing

18
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:54,949
math for fun that really interesting

19
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,540
encryption and security so I'm entering

20
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:58,040
high school this year and hope to learn

21
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:00,430
a whole lot more about computer science

22
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:03,320
cyber security and cryptology

23
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:04,968
hi I'm Krypton I'm a Gryffindor and I am

24
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,890
proud of it I love woodworking and

25
00:01:04,968 --> 00:01:08,928
crafts I like to pick locks and I love

26
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:16,009
to code I'm right now working on my very

27
00:01:08,929 --> 00:01:18,890
own online entertainment portal so

28
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:20,990
stories are really fun they teach about

29
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:22,729
the world humans have used stories for

30
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,048
thousands of years to figure out things

31
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:25,429
that they don't understand and to

32
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:27,710
explain complicated ideas

33
00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:29,780
mr. Issa had the right idea with his

34
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:32,059
fables my parents have been talking with

35
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:34,189
hair that tortoise since I was little

36
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,770
the ancient Greeks used myths to explain

37
00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:38,389
seasons variety of spiders my brother

38
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:40,939
and I like to read oh you remember

39
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:42,710
things you need it's a lot easier to

40
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:44,960
remember stories on a lesson

41
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:47,809
me personally songs are even better than

42
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,419
stories songs are like stories just set

43
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:53,240
to music I learned how to use order of

44
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:54,619
operations in math with just a song let

45
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,048
me tell you it was a lot more fun

46
00:01:54,619 --> 00:01:59,659
singing and dancing math than just

47
00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:01,549
memorizing the rules anyway one day I

48
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:03,649
realized that there's a lot of info

49
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:05,569
section in the Harry Potter books so I

50
00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:09,619
tried to find as many as I could

51
00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:11,480
that's how this all started first we're

52
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:13,960
going to talk about the coolest and also

53
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,149
the most cursed subject at Hogwarts if

54
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,980
against the dark arts this is the class

55
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,900
where Harry and his friends learn about

56
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:21,399
things that can hurt them but also how

57
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,980
to protect themselves it's a pretty

58
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,530
dangerous class - for examples never

59
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:28,390
open a cage full of Pixies thanks for

60
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,580
fantastic Gilderoy Lockhart for that

61
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:32,019
lesson

62
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,060
muggles don't have to worry about Pixies

63
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,160
or a Dementors but being online can be

64
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:38,410
dangerous - I don't want someone to hack

65
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,900
my school and change my grades so I feel

66
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:43,000
oh my or steal money out of my bank

67
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,490
attack I don't have enough money and I

68
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,930
but I would like to keep it we have to

69
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:49,030
know how to protect ourselves and

70
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:51,670
information about ourselves when we are

71
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:54,490
online we'll talk about the dark arts

72
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:58,119
later but safety first security is very

73
00:02:54,490 --> 00:03:00,850
very important so we start with

74
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,920
authentication first Who am I who are

75
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:05,079
you in a world of harry potter who you

76
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:09,730
say you are is very important can you

77
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:12,940
prove that you are you this is from the

78
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:15,910
store sir stop three up two across he

79
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,290
muttered right stand back Harry he

80
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,520
tapped the walls three times at the

81
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,440
point of his umbrella

82
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,210
we've just begun to learn about the

83
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,609
Wizarding World and Hagrid has already

84
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:29,950
shown us our very very first security

85
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:32,650
example so let's talk about passwords we

86
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:35,200
are used to passwords email Instagram

87
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:37,600
zoom meetings we have too many of them

88
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,600
we all complain about them but we need

89
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,670
them we could probably talk about passes

90
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:45,660
for the entire hour we are going to

91
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:49,359
focus on three types rotating passwords

92
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:51,310
biometrics and shared passwords rotating

93
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,920
passwords refer to passwords that change

94
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:55,750
periodically someone steals the password

95
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,609
that person has a limited amount of time

96
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:00,280
to use that password otherwise it

97
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:02,410
expires and no longer works does that

98
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,210
sound familiar the passers enter each

99
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:06,310
houses common room change regularly

100
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:09,040
sometimes a member of the house don't

101
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:10,570
even know password and have to wait for

102
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,150
somebody who does know to come

103
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:14,620
Ronna Harry often get locked up outside

104
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:17,079
the common room because they are up to

105
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:19,989
no good password changed Neville almost

106
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:21,159
always has directs rescue it also makes

107
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:22,659
it really hard to sneak into another

108
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,660
half his company because you have to

109
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:27,430
make sure you know the latest password

110
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,380
biometric password receives body parts

111
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:31,389
so in the muggle world we might use a

112
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,440
retina scanners or fingerprints and the

113
00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:35,410
Wizarding World

114
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:38,050
thieves goblins biometric scan be used

115
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:40,419
on their own like apples face ID or you

116
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:42,160
can unlock a phone with a fingerprint or

117
00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:43,960
it could be the second part in two

118
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:50,289
factor authentication and it goes with a

119
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:52,780
password and some passwords are shared

120
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:54,130
within a group or a team everyone in the

121
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:58,179
office is gonna know the password to

122
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:59,469
open up the keypad everybody in the

123
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,639
office again know the code to open up

124
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:02,590
the keypad in the front of the building

125
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,870
if you don't need to go into building

126
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:07,239
you won't know the code in the same way

127
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:08,740
only wizards and witches know what spot

128
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,750
on the wall they have to press and in

129
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:13,440
what order be able to get into Diagon

130
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:15,990
Alley there's a difference between

131
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,190
authentication and authorization

132
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:19,990
authentication is about who you are

133
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:22,840
authorization it's about what you're

134
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:24,690
allowed to do to security you want folks

135
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,530
just because you're authorized

136
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:29,020
authenticated doesn't mean that you're

137
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:31,448
always authorized that's computing let

138
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:33,219
me say the portrait of the fat lady is

139
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:35,620
at the entrance of Gryffindor common

140
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:38,830
room and the only way in is if the fat

141
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,900
lady lets you she knows that Harry

142
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:44,320
Potter's are great is joy Gryffindor

143
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:45,789
great that's authentication but the fat

144
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,310
lady isn't gonna let him in

145
00:05:45,789 --> 00:05:50,770
just because he's Gryffindor and he's

146
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:52,870
Harry Potter Harry Potter still has to

147
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:54,669
give her the correct password that is

148
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:57,070
authorization he has to prove he is

149
00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:59,349
allowed to go in authorization can

150
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:01,659
happen without authentication too though

151
00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:03,490
in Goblet of Fire Cedric Diggory tells

152
00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:04,900
Harry the password zones in the prefix

153
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:10,030
bathroom and it works for him even

154
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:12,609
though Harry is not a prefect hazard

155
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:13,960
managers save all our passwords this way

156
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:16,180
we can have super long and super

157
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:18,430
complicated passwords for each of our

158
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,110
accounts because we don't want to use

159
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:22,180
the same passwords over and over and

160
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:23,949
over again we also don't want to

161
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:26,199
accidentally forget that that happened

162
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:27,820
to you I keep asking my parents if I can

163
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:29,620
use LastPass but they keep telling me I

164
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:32,020
don't have enough account yet although I

165
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:33,759
am working on it see your keepers are

166
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,740
like password managers because you give

167
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:40,539
your secrets to them and they keep them

168
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:41,320
safe for you we live in New York City we

169
00:06:40,539 --> 00:06:43,539
have a dead bill

170
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,969
and regular lock on our door and a chain

171
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:47,680
that's later defense someone trying to

172
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:50,170
break in half to get past my guitar

173
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,940
laughter get has a deadbolt and cut the

174
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:53,560
chain it's a lot harder to get through

175
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:56,050
the comparative we just had one lockable

176
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,690
door in security it's almost always

177
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:03,040
better and several challenges than just

178
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:05,560
four still in the Sorcerer's Stone we

179
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,600
have this bit from Halloran he borrowed

180
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,430
fluffy from me then some of the teachers

181
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,340
didn't shipments professor sprout

182
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:14,290
Professor Flitwick Professor McGonagall

183
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:16,599
Professor Quirrell and Dumbledore

184
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:18,220
himself did something of course hang on

185
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,710
I've forgotten somebody oh yeah

186
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:22,540
Professor Snape Hagrid this time ice

187
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:24,099
talking about defenses when something is

188
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:26,380
super important you want to make sure

189
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:29,710
it's hard and time-consuming for anyone

190
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:31,990
to steal the more layers of security

191
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:34,120
have guarding something the harder it is

192
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:36,220
to get past it's like having a lot of

193
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,590
locks in a door maybe you have to get

194
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:40,360
through multiple doors to get to a tocsy

195
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:42,549
you can afford to droop and at every

196
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,380
door you have to swipe your badge or you

197
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:46,000
have to enter your password anytime you

198
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,530
do something different which would be

199
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,230
really annoying but it also slow down

200
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:52,929
attack so I stuck with the Triwizard

201
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:55,030
Tournament the final challenge is a maze

202
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,410
and there are many obstacles preventing

203
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:59,890
the school champions from getting to the

204
00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:01,890
middle the triangular Cup there's the

205
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:04,030
Sphinx their spells

206
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:05,710
however the obstacles are really that

207
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:07,869
differ from each other if you had a wand

208
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:09,909
and knew the rice spells except for the

209
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,680
Sphinx if you think about it that

210
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:15,910
acromantula and the blessings group or

211
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,430
even basically the same challenge what's

212
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:22,720
better than having a lots of challenges

213
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:24,670
having unique ones MFA or multi-factor

214
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,550
authentication is when you need more

215
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:29,170
than just a password to log in a UV key

216
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:31,330
is something different from a password

217
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:34,150
and protects accounts even if someone

218
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:36,280
has your password that person also needs

219
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:38,919
the physical objects or in the movies

220
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:41,650
when the spy needs a badge voice

221
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:44,290
recognition and a retina scan just to

222
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:48,760
get into a room you want different types

223
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:50,230
of security defenses the defenses the

224
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,030
teachers put around the Sorcerer's Stone

225
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,780
is a great example of how unique

226
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,370
defenses

227
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:56,980
make it hard for a thief to

228
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:59,470
succeed Harry Hermione and Ron had to

229
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:02,529
get past fluffy with music Hermione knew

230
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:04,620
how to escape the devil snare because

231
00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:06,250
she'd actually paid attention in

232
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:09,790
herbology

233
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:12,550
Harry flew around the room of flying

234
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:15,219
keys to find just the right key to

235
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:17,729
unlock the door and Ron played wizard

236
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:21,100
chess to get across the room

237
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:22,690
Professor Quirrell then failed to find

238
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:26,800
the stone because he didn't understand

239
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:28,960
how to use the error of Arison but Harry

240
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:33,329
did each of these challenges required

241
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:35,350
different skills and strengths

242
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:37,150
encryption is a really important

243
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:39,730
security layer and it protects many

244
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:42,310
things we do online encryption makes it

245
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:45,430
possible to talk privately my snaps on

246
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:47,020
snapchat are encrypted the HTTP on

247
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:49,209
websites means data from the site is

248
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:51,040
encrypted when it goes to the server for

249
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:53,050
online shopping that means that credit

250
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,209
card numbers protected from thieves for

251
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,699
logging in a password isn't just put out

252
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:59,380
there in plaintext

253
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:01,750
we jump ahead to Goblet of Fire for this

254
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:03,400
one I just thought you want to take

255
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,650
advantage of the common room being quiet

256
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:08,230
she said really get a chance to work on

257
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:09,459
that egg oh I I reckon I've got a pretty

258
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:11,680
good idea what it's about now

259
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:14,219
Harry would have you really said

260
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:17,170
Hermione looking impressed well done

261
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:19,000
here Hermione wants Harry to decrypt an

262
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:22,930
encrypted message we'll come back to

263
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,990
this in a bit secrets are pieces of

264
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:28,420
information such as passwords and credit

265
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:30,390
card numbers only certain people or

266
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:32,979
servers need to see this information

267
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:35,110
secrets can also be messages and

268
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:37,630
conversations only the people who are

269
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:40,420
having a conversation with Chenoa who

270
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:42,520
are saying if someone we don't trust get

271
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:45,160
to see our secrets we can be in grave

272
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:47,439
danger encryption and other methods help

273
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,000
us share secrets with only those we

274
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,560
trust

275
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,209
when Dumbledore's Army is first formed

276
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,609
in the order of the Phoenix the members

277
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:57,459
realize that don't that Dolores Umbridge

278
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:59,170
could not find out about the group da

279
00:10:57,459 --> 00:11:01,060
members need to trust each other not to

280
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:02,740
go blabbing to non-members about what

281
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:05,819
the group does where they meet or even

282
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:07,710
who the members were they science agree

283
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:10,500
and promising to keep the secret but

284
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:13,170
when - Mariana tells Dolores Umbridge

285
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:16,200
about the group that trust is broken

286
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:19,880
Mariana is punished too though as boils

287
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:22,830
erupted on her face to spell out sneak

288
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:26,100
hermione is very serious about keeping

289
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:28,290
secrets one way to protect information

290
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,510
is encryption when you equipped

291
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:32,099
information use a rule to change the

292
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:34,620
information into a form that can not be

293
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,540
understood anyone who must understand

294
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:39,000
the information needs to know the rule

295
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:40,410
to decrypt the gibberish sometimes at

296
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,620
different rules even necessary to

297
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:45,600
decrypt it if the rule is the same to

298
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:48,090
encrypt and decrypt the data that's

299
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,530
called a symmetric encryption that means

300
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:52,290
that the sender and the recipient each

301
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:54,270
have the same key the rule is different

302
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:56,459
that's a symmetric encryption because

303
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:58,650
there is one key to encrypt and one key

304
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:01,290
to decrypt we'll talk about this more

305
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:03,000
later in Goblet of Fire

306
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:04,770
Harry steals a dragon egg in the first

307
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,990
challenge and that contains a clue about

308
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:08,400
a second challenge he has to figure out

309
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:11,460
how to make the magically recorded

310
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:14,010
message given loud and annoying noise to

311
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:16,530
an actual clue he can use the decryption

312
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:17,910
key turned out to be water when he open

313
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:19,920
the egg in the air it played the

314
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:21,360
encrypted form of the message when they

315
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,550
opened egg under water and listened

316
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:29,220
under water the message is decrypted and

317
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:30,870
he learns the next clue there are many

318
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,940
ways to protect informations that

319
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:34,980
they're harder to steal ciphers are

320
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,630
different methods that can be used some

321
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:39,630
are better than others you can use

322
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:41,880
substitution ciphers and rot13 to write

323
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:43,350
secret messages to your friends you need

324
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:46,620
a bit more than that for online shopping

325
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:49,440
them RSA is a widely used a symmetric

326
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:51,180
key algorithm for encrypting data AES is

327
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,310
an example of a symmetric key algorithm

328
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:56,729
in cryptographers are still developing

329
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:58,949
new methods we mentioned the Sphinx from

330
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:00,720
Goblet of Fire earlier this Fink's

331
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:02,190
required Harry to solve a riddle for

332
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,770
letting him proceed further into the

333
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:06,420
meets the riddle was a code and you

334
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:08,640
needed the answer to get to the rest of

335
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:10,860
the secret or in this case the rest of

336
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,630
the maze in Deathly Hallows

337
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,310
Dumbledore gave Hermione the first

338
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:16,320
edition copy and the tales of you in the

339
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:18,569
bar the book is originally there's an

340
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,589
runic script so Hermione first had to

341
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:22,510
figure out what is

342
00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:24,550
her task wasn't just translating the

343
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,990
route from English she also needed to

344
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:31,029
his Dumbledore's notes to figure out

345
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:32,680
what Dumbledore wanted her to know one

346
00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:34,329
of the most important ways to use

347
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,719
encryption is to protect what we're

348
00:13:34,329 --> 00:13:36,729
saying

349
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,260
so eavesdroppers like Fred and George

350
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:40,660
don't hear anything even with their

351
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:43,120
extendable ears the point is to send

352
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:45,370
messages in a way that can't be read or

353
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,339
heard by someone else and to make sure

354
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:49,839
that each of the correct recipients

355
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:52,120
encryption is also proof that no one has

356
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,920
changed the message either imagine

357
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:57,880
trying to buy anything online was a game

358
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:59,589
of telephone or credit card number I'd

359
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,839
slap point out something sighing

360
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:03,610
George's extendable ears is a perfect

361
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,100
example of a man-in-the-middle attack

362
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:08,950
your person a talking-to person beat and

363
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:11,680
in front of George or person seen in

364
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:14,200
some cases are right there to learn what

365
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,660
in the world is going on person a and B

366
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,100
most likely have no idea that there is

367
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:20,319
anyone else taking part in their

368
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:24,010
conversation what's the little tangent

369
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:26,050
you can keep God anyway in an end-to-end

370
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:28,569
encryption messages are encrypted by the

371
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:30,430
sender and decrypted by the receiver to

372
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:32,829
keep anyone intercepting the message

373
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:34,630
from getting the information there's so

374
00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:37,329
many ways to send messages using antenna

375
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:40,240
Krypton out there snapchat iMessage

376
00:14:37,329 --> 00:14:42,459
signal the Death Eaters have the dark

377
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,380
mark on their forearms they know that

378
00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:46,899
when that mark Burres Baltimore has

379
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:48,550
summoned them they must obey as far as I

380
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:50,019
can tell there is no way for someone

381
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:52,899
else to trigger in the dark mark as a

382
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:55,240
fake call Dumbledore's Army has members

383
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:56,890
in different houses and classes and it's

384
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,720
difficult to pass messages but the time

385
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:00,939
and date of their meetings as long as I

386
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,070
can put a flier up in the Great Hall the

387
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:04,839
messages carry the members carry

388
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:07,720
enchanted galleons that display the

389
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:08,740
message secretly the members of the

390
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,899
order of the Phoenix

391
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:13,480
also use antenna encryption using a

392
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:15,579
Patronus so the Patronus is specific to

393
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,380
the person casting the spell it shows

394
00:15:15,579 --> 00:15:20,260
that the message is genuine and really

395
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:22,120
from that person Arthur Weasley sends

396
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:23,500
the Patronus of a weasel to the burro to

397
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,360
warn them of the minister of magic

398
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,980
coming Kingsley Shacklebolt

399
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,290
sends a warning message of yet Patronus

400
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:31,209
Emma links to the burro during floor and

401
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:32,250
Bill recent wedding but the ministry has

402
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:35,729
fallen to the deaf you

403
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:37,170
coming I'm gonna throw this code in here

404
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:40,020
because it's a cool reporter the

405
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:41,880
Phoenix after fake galleons unreal

406
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:43,530
galleons that's just a serial number

407
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:46,350
referring to the Goblin who cast the

408
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:48,270
coin on these fake coins own the numbers

409
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:50,520
will change to reflect the time and date

410
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:52,290
of the next meter when Harry sets the

411
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:54,329
date of the next meeting he'll change

412
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:58,010
the number on his coin and they'll all

413
00:15:54,330 --> 00:16:01,410
change to mimic his sometimes you just

414
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:03,450
don't know if the message is really from

415
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:05,579
the person it claims to be that's why

416
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:08,760
using an out-of-band method to confirm

417
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:10,950
the sender is helpful you get an email

418
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,930
telling you to do something text the

419
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:13,890
person just to make sure the email is

420
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:16,439
from that person

421
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:18,750
Harry usually uses Hedwig to send

422
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:21,480
letters to Sirius but when all the

423
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:23,970
messages sent by apples are monitored

424
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:26,670
he's afraid to use Hedwig so he uses the

425
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:29,460
flu Network instead the way that public

426
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:32,160
key the way the public keys and private

427
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:33,540
keys work is that Mathis is you sent to

428
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,850
you are encrypted with the public key

429
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:37,680
that you share with everyone and can

430
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:40,910
only be decrypted with the private key

431
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:44,880
that only you have my parents sent in

432
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:48,030
PGP my parents use PGP to send encrypted

433
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,920
emails this way sadly we couldn't find

434
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:51,900
any examples in the Harry Potter books

435
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:55,650
if you find any please share them with

436
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:57,870
us the next two defenses don't fall

437
00:16:55,650 --> 00:17:01,290
under authentication or encryption we

438
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:03,060
thought they are pretty cool in the

439
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:06,540
half-blood Prince we learned that very

440
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:08,310
dark magic or proxies well you split

441
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:10,199
your soul you see it says Slughorn and

442
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:12,810
high part of it in the object outside

443
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:15,870
the body then even if one's body is a

444
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:17,520
texture destroyed one cannot die or part

445
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:22,619
of the solar mains earthbound and

446
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:26,040
undamaged with data fragmentation a

447
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:28,379
secret like a top-secret file it's split

448
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,930
up into small parts and stored in

449
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,940
different places the idea is to make it

450
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:34,980
hard for someone to find and assemble

451
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:37,230
all the pieces in the right way to view

452
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:39,540
the file encrypt each part and it gets

453
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:42,150
even more complicated but what I'm

454
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:45,270
really really frustrate that it's a Kurd

455
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:47,160
put the pieces on different machines

456
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:49,470
throughout the entire network the

457
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,780
catches that slows you down when you

458
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:53,610
want the file to but the secret may be

459
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:56,430
important enough to be worth taking that

460
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:58,439
extra time it's like a Horcrux the

461
00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:00,780
different fragments are all sections of

462
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,700
a whole Baltimore put a bit of his soul

463
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:05,550
into seven different places his diary

464
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:07,410
his grandfather's ring sounds are

465
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:10,290
slytherins lock it

466
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:13,200
helga hufflepuff's cup Rowena

467
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:15,889
Ravenclaw's diadem nough gave me the

468
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:19,260
snake and by accident Harry Potter

469
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:21,650
damaged the Horcrux and Voldemort solos

470
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:23,440
damaged

471
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:25,520
damaged enough of these fire or

472
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,850
fragments and you won't be able to

473
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:31,160
reassemble the document anymore there

474
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:33,050
ways to trick attackers and to think

475
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,640
that they're successful honey pots

476
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:35,750
shrink attackers into breaking into

477
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,540
computers that all have anything

478
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:40,250
important cyber deception sets of decoy

479
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:42,440
in the network and tricks attackers into

480
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:44,990
going after those decoys it's a time

481
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,550
waster all the time the attackers are

482
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:48,770
trying to steal passwords and files from

483
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:50,930
the decoy machine is all the time

484
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:53,690
they're not using to steal real files

485
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:55,610
for damage real machines the order of

486
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:57,020
the Phoenix needed to pick up Harry from

487
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:59,060
Uncle Vernon's has to take him to the

488
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:01,910
Burrow they need the Death Eaters

489
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:03,980
will try to kidnap or kill Harry so they

490
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:06,920
camp with the plan to have seven Harry

491
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:08,270
Potter's with seven identical Harry

492
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,010
Potter's the Death Eaters that have a

493
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:12,290
hard time knowing which group had the

494
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:13,760
real harden the idea was to try to lower

495
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:16,070
the Death Eaters into attacking the

496
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,440
decoy Harry and give the real Harry time

497
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:21,169
to get to the Burrow

498
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,880
we talked a lot about defenses but what

499
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:25,130
in the world are we protecting ourselves

500
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,810
from Harry and his friends learned about

501
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:30,260
the attack so they could use their

502
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:34,159
defenses so this section looks at the

503
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:36,470
most common attacks we go back to a Poli

504
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:39,500
to the we go back to the Chamber of

505
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:41,450
Secrets for this one what we have to do

506
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:44,360
is get inside the Slytherin common room

507
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:46,910
and ask not void for a few a few

508
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:50,030
questions without him realizing it's us

509
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:54,280
don't bother with the truth serum spell

510
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:57,830
that forces people to talk trick them

511
00:19:54,280 --> 00:20:00,440
social engineering is when you but else

512
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:03,260
is when you convince someone to tell you

513
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:05,540
something really important even if they

514
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:08,390
should the easiest way is just to ask

515
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:11,360
okay what's the Netflix password not

516
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:13,100
telling you that oh well I tried but

517
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,830
what if I knew that the password was

518
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:18,730
saying grandma's birthday then I can

519
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:22,100
just ask her and she'll probably tell me

520
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:24,050
Hagrid accidentally revealed how music

521
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:26,149
puts fluffy to sleep which is how

522
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:27,379
Professor Quirrell got past fluffy when

523
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:31,310
I was trying to steal the Sorcerer's

524
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:34,250
Stone Hagrid didn't need to do that here

525
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:36,250
he also used Felix Felicis to help him

526
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:39,890
talk to Horace long

527
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:42,890
Slughorn didn't intend to tell Harry

528
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:45,860
anything about Horcruxes but wound up

529
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:48,380
doing so don't tell a stranger on a

530
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:50,209
discord Channel the name of your dog if

531
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:52,070
that's your security question if your

532
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:53,510
friends offering five bucks for your

533
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:55,970
password don't give it to them

534
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:58,570
not even if it means when you can buy

535
00:20:55,970 --> 00:21:03,050
loste candy

536
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:03,560
speaking of candy pair drop a licorice

537

541
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:15,770
Harry NoZe Dumbledore loves candy when

542
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:19,150
you're Russian sometimes you don't want

543
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:19,150
to go through the entire list

544
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:23,870
brute force attacks or Morland could be

545
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:26,570
successful when the person is using a

546
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:28,540
common password like password 1 or a

547
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:31,159
guess full pattern like QWERTY you in

548
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:33,260
the previous quote Harry has to run

549
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:35,390
through a long list before accidentally

550
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:37,160
guessing huh crush clusters and jelly

551
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:39,050
hollows Harry rightly guesses that

552
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:41,960
Dumbledore is a new password enter the

553
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:43,700
Headmaster's towered brute-force attacks

554
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,740
can be really really slow and really

555
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:47,810
inefficient because it's just a long

556
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:49,760
guessing it it may be just going through

557
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:51,530
a list of frequently used passwords or

558
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,450
it could be trying to put permutations

559
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:55,250
of letters and numbers but if an

560
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:59,030
attacker has plenty of time and it's

561
00:21:55,250 --> 00:22:01,550
still worth the effort for this fake is

562
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:04,389
from the Chamber of Secrets again except

563
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:07,610
that he looked pale and shocked Ron was

564
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:09,980
indistinguishable from crab that

565
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:13,699
Polyjuice potion is quite the ultimate

566
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:16,250
form of identity theft Harry and his

567
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:18,350
friends use Polyjuice potion to make

568
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:20,840
themselves look like other people so

569
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:22,969
that they could be in places that maybe

570
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,889
they shouldn't be they sneak into the

571
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:27,530
Slytherin common room to talk to Draco

572
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:29,630
Malfoy lady they turn themselves into

573
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:31,580
actual ministry workers to get inside

574
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:33,860
the Ministry of Magic the danger of

575
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:36,919
course is if you run into the person you

576
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:39,620
are pretending to be someone once stole

577
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:42,320
my dad's social security number and

578
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:44,300
opened up a bunch of new credit cards he

579
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:47,030
found out because that person bought a

580
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:48,540
lot of stuff from Target and old navies

581
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:50,639
and other store

582
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:52,860
and he got the bill if someone has your

583
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,290
email address and password that person

584
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:57,389
can send emails at you I would have so

585
00:22:55,290 --> 00:23:02,909
much fun pretending to be my brother on

586
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:06,030
his inside cap tips to be a secure which

587
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:08,040
are wizard use a secret keeper protector

588
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:10,230
sensitive information in a safe and

589
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:12,540
secure place protected with a strong

590
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:16,070
password password managers are awesome

591
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:19,470
use them Dumbledore was a great wizard

592
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:21,480
his passwords were not so great don't

593
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:24,270
use candies or hobbies as your password

594
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:26,550
make them complicated and hard to guess

595
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:29,790
for someone else but easy to remember

596
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:32,340
for you don't rely on just one layer of

597
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:34,379
security if the Sorcerer's Stone is

598
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:37,139
pronounced by so many things why is it

599
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:39,480
tourists are protected that well if for

600
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:41,460
my use sending message is that can't be

601
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,860
intercepted and you should be doing the

602
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:47,310
same thing there's many ways to use an

603
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:49,050
encryption use them Sirius Black cut

604
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:50,399
into the Gryffindor common room because

605
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:52,409
Neville attend the password is going to

606
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,060
loss that paper don't write down

607
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:57,660
passwords on a post-it or someplace

608
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:59,280
anyone can see look out for potential

609
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,480
scams when someone is trying to get you

610
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,639
to reveal something they don't do to

611
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,390
know if it's too good to be true it

612
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,810
probably is

613
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:11,610
and then remember what madam oudy always

614
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:14,820
said constant vigilance it's not just

615
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:16,409
