1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,919
my name is marianne watick and i'm a

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,000
senior software engineer at raytheon

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:09,760
my presentation is the wonderful world

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,320
of devsecops and harry potter

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,200
our agenda for today is my biography an

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,640
introduction

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,439
to devsecops and harry potter and

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,880
we'll be discussing the terms for devsec

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,880
ops and any questions

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,679
my biography i am a cyber engineer at

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,080
raytheon and i've been there for 29

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,840
years

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,680
both in software and the cyber

14
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,440
engineering departments

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,519
i have an msia in cyber security i have

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,320
certs in secure coding

17
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,680
and i'm working on others in other certs

18
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,960
right now

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,760
i work with programs implementing secure

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,320
coding

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,960
static head analysis and working in

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,920
their devs tech ops processes

23
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,800
i try to stress the importance of using

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,120
secure coding practices and help with

25
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,559
the software development phases and

26
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,039
making sure

27
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,840
that they keep their code as secure as

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,560
possible

29
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,520
we all know that over the years a lot of

30
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,520
programs

31
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,560
didn't understand exactly what secure

32
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,920
coding was

33
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,240
and now that we're actually using

34
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,720
devsecops we're finding a lot of bugs

35
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,720
and code

36
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:27,679
introduction okay

37
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:31,280
why did i come up with this well

38
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:34,320
introduction we're going to talk about

39
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,600
liking devsecops to the harry potter

40
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,479
books and movies

41
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,240
as well as their timeline i'm going to

42
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,360
give you some analogies

43
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,759
that will tie them to both the movies

44
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:49,039
and the books and kind of give you a

45
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:51,040
better understanding so that you can

46
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,680
kind of remember the phases of death

47
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,880
secops a little bit better

48
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,119
the people that i work with not

49
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,759
necessarily the security people

50
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,200
but the software people don't understand

51
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,240
what dev stack ops

52
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,598
in all of the phases of

53
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,799
the process actually are

54
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:15,760
we have to explain

55
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,760
what all the different steps are and if

56
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,120
i can liken it to something that maybe

57
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,000
they would understand

58
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,480
like harry potter it might make it more

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,239
fun

60
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,238
and something that they would remember

61
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:35,120
so definite of does sec ops

62
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:38,640
basically we've all we all um

63
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:42,000
heard devops when it first came out

64
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:45,040
and devops

65
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,160
came out and said okay

66
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,720
we were going to actually add security

67
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,840
in

68
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,400
where we could and security was added on

69
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,000
top

70
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:59,200
of devops it was security as code added

71
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,920
just as a endpoint and it was kind of

72
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,480
added on top or where they could find

73
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:09,599
the place to put it in but now

74
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:11,760
devsecops is actually including security

75
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,040
where it needs to be actually in the

76
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,079
beginning

77
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,480
and in the where it needs to be all the

78
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,000
way through the processes so that it's

79
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,599
not just in

80
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,519
where you know kind of yeah we

81
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,879
we we need to do security sometimes so

82
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,720
let's just stick it here

83
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,560
let's stick it there and hey where do

84
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,840
you sit we do we do security

85
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,840
yeah we're doing security

86
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,679
so for those who don't know about harry

87
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,760
potter

88
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,360
yeah i've got my harry potter things

89
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,040
if you don't know what this is then

90
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,799
you're a muggle non-magical person

91
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,840
harry potter is a series of books and

92
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:55,040
movies describing a young wizard harry

93
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,799
and his friends ron and hermione takes

94
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,319
them through their daily lives

95
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:02,799
over the years through school and out

96
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:05,119
through good times and bad and they

97
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:10,799
fight evil along the way

98
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,799
and they get to use magic along the way

99
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:20,079
step one of the devsec process

100
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:23,600
collecting code and building it

101
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,280
in a version control tool i've included

102
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,199
a couple of the different tools that can

103
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,080
be used for version control

104
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,400
a lot of us are used to using this as

105
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,960
like

106
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,520
just a cm tool but now that we're

107
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,799
actually

108
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,840
doing a lot more with a cm tool we're

109
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,919
actually calling it version control tool

110
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,239
because we're actually doing more than

111
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:46,240
just one build at a time

112
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,840
we may actually be doing multiple

113
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,560
versioning

114
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,638
multiple versions at the same time i've

115
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,000
actually got one program that's actually

116
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,120
doing multiple versions

117
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,080
of a package or multiple versions of

118
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,400
code

119
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:05,599
at the same time so this is being done

120
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,479
at right now i know of a program that's

121
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,759
doing this

122
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:12,479
so using using a version control tool

123
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,560
is more common where before we used to

124
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:17,599
just call it cm

125
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,520
and doing builds um

126
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,080
you could do them nightly you could do

127
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,560
them as codes checked in

128
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,000
it depends on how much code check-ins

129
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,600
you're doing

130
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,320
um i've got some programs that do builds

131
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,840
on a nightly basis because they do a lot

132
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,360
of code check-ins

133
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,919
i do i have some they do it

134
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,240
whenever their code is checked in

135
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:45,359
because they don't do a lot of code

136
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,919
check-ins so doing it when code is

137
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,080
checked in

138
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,080
is more more feasible for them

139
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:58,720
so for step one for for harry potter for

140
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:02,080
people that would understand this

141
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,840
think of hogwarts as the hogwarts

142
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,039
students going to diagon alley

143
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,520
they have to collect everything just

144
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,280
like

145
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,520
collecting everything in the cm tool

146
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,280
they had to go to hogwarts

147
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,799
and so they need all of the stuff they

148
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,719
need to go to school

149
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,840
they need to collect their uniforms

150
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,400
their books

151
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,318
their their cauldrons to get them do

152
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,638
their magical

153
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,840
potions and things like that they need

154
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,880
their quills to

155
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,599
to write all their their

156
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,479
school work on and they need their

157
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,000
parchment

158
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,000
i don't even know what parchment's

159
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,360
actually made of but

160
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,199
and then they have to take the hogwarts

161
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,400
express to school

162
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,080
they get they get on the train and they

163
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,479
put on their uniforms and their robes to

164
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,318
go to school i actually got to raid the

165
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,960
hogwarts express when i got when i went

166
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,360
to uh

167
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:57,198
universal that's where i got my wand

168
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,919
that was actually kind of fun i did that

169
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,919
on my birthday

170
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:07,280
step two is unit testing

171
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,639
and unit tests can be written in a lot

172
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,520
of different uh

173
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,639
programs it can be used for a lot of

174
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,560
different languages

175
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,720
we actually have some programs at our

176
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,919
building that actually do

177
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,639
use a right unit tests and i'm not

178
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,960
sure at this time if we actually have

179
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:28,639
any that are actually integrating them

180
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,000
um but it would be something that could

181
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,199
be actually integrated into

182
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,400
your pipeline but there's

183
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,319
they could be written for a lot of

184
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,198
different languages and they could

185
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,000
actually be

186
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,720
integrated into your build pipeline and

187
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,160
once you're

188
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,479
once you have them in they could

189
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,639
actually be for

190
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,318
this for this step they could actually

191
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:52,160
be used for jenkins

192
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:54,160
used as promoted builds actually go

193
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,440
from one step to the next step to the

194
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,840
next step and if it

195
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,240
actually passes your unit test you

196
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,440
actually can go to the next step

197
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,639
and just keep going on in your

198
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,639
actual pipeline

199
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,039
for harry potter students arrive at

200
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,960
hogwarts

201
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,159
getting off the train getting to the

202
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,239
school

203
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,680
their testing is done by what's called

204
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,720
the sorting hat

205
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,199
you can't even see my picture

206
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:25,360
[Music]

207
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,360
um the sorting hat actually

208
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,360
tests each student when it gets when

209
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,399
they get to school

210
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:35,440
and they are tested

211
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,039
by this sorting hat by the values that

212
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,360
the students have

213
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,360
and they go into their houses and that

214
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,320
becomes their family for the years they

215
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,320
are at hogwarts

216
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:57,120
the next step in the devsec process

217
00:08:53,200 --> 00:09:00,800
is the code quality analysis phase

218
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,800
all of these different

219
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,920
tools can be used for what's called code

220
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,200
quality

221
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,599
it can be for either code quality or

222
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,399
security issues can be found

223
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,360
and a lot of these different tools can

224
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,720
be run

225
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:22,640
against a lot of different languages

226
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:26,880
some of these have different platforms

227
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:29,920
different languages they can all be run

228
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:32,959
during the build process or after

229
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,560
and um these issues can be found they

230
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:37,760
could be

231
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,680
you could actually return a report and

232
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,640
say hey too many issues were found

233
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,719
you don't want to continue um going on

234
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,920
to the next phase or you might want to

235
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,880
say hey

236
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,880
oh there's a certain number of highs you

237
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,920
don't want to continue

238
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:56,000
um come up with a different type of

239
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,199
criteria that you just want to

240
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,880
say hey something like that is is

241
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,160
something that you want to check

242
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:07,200
so many security issues things like that

243
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:10,880
and it's something that it would be very

244
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,959
dependent on what type of program

245
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,920
or the code that you're actually running

246
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:17,199
this these

247
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:20,479
tools on um we want

248
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:23,200
we have a couple of the tools on this

249
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,160
on this list at our site that we're

250
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,440
running

251
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,920
and several of the languages

252
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,920
as well

253
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:37,839
for quality

254
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:41,839
at hogwarts i've i've listed a couple of

255
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,480
quality magic mistakes that were made by

256
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,320
students

257
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,079
at hogwarts um for instance the uh the

258
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,360
polyjuice potion

259
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,800
apollo juice is a something that

260
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,680
students can

261
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,959
or anyone can take that could turn you

262
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,519
into something else

263
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,880
it's usually for a person to turn into

264
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,600
another person

265
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:06,079
unfortunately hermione turned into a cat

266
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:10,320
by accident you're not supposed to

267
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:13,680
turn into a non-human

268
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:16,720
and she turned into a cat that was

269
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,680
not supposed to happen uh she made a

270
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,880
potion

271
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,479
and it didn't turn out quite right and

272
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,920
it blew up in her face

273
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:29,120
another quality mistake uh

274
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:32,560
one of the other people in the uh

275
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:36,480
the big three in hogwarts

276
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:39,760
tried to make a cup out of his rat

277
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,440
and it had a tail um

278
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,519
that wasn't quite supposed to happen

279
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:47,839
either and he

280
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:51,360
had a broken wand and he tried to cast a

281
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:54,560
spell on somebody because

282
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:58,320
he said something bad about his future

283
00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:01,839
girlfriend and it backfired

284
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:05,040
caused him to throw up slugs um

285
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,600
basically the whole idea about this

286
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,519
slide

287
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,920
is that basically

288
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,720
magic needs to be perfect just like

289
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,000
software

290
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:20,399
and well

291
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,760
software can't be perfect i mean we're

292
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:26,560
all human

293
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,560
but needs to be as close to

294
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:34,880
good and as secure as we can make it

295
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:39,839
so quality and secure

296
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,839
code is what's important so

297
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,959
step four is packaging

298
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:50,800
when code is built it needs to be

299
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:54,160
packaged in order to be able to

300
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:57,359
release it and

301
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,719
or we need there's different ways to

302
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,200
release

303
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,839
and that would actually depend on how

304
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,200
your

305
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,880
customer or how it needs to be deployed

306
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,240
so some of the different ways that it

307
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,279
can be released

308
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:14,720
is through a jar for java war

309
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:17,760
for web in ear

310
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,240
enterprise architecture

311
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,920
or install shield a lot most people know

312
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,959
what an installation file are

313
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:28,959
is i mean i used to write them a lot

314
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:30,959
uh years ago and there's

315
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,359
many other types of archives files that

316
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,518
could be used for packaging

317
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,839
or you could just bundle them up some

318
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,959
other type of way

319
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:44,320
but they all need to be packaged

320
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:47,119
some secure way so this is

321
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,000
this is the packaging step but you need

322
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,959
to make sure that

323
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,079
however they are packaged it has to be

324
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,839
securely

325
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:58,880
done and it needs to be done in a manner

326
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,880
that it is also

327
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,839
done someplace that is secure

328
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:10,160
so for harry potter

329
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,519
when you sat get ready to package and

330
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,959
deliver

331
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:18,079
you they are they use

332
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:20,319
a couple different methods letters and

333
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,359
packages can be said by owl

334
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,040
unfortunately

335
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:28,240
you have to watch out because they bite

336
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:31,760
they also uh sometimes don't get there

337
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:34,800
quite as fast as you may want them to be

338
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,720
notes could be delivered by patronus and

339
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,199
they could also be delivered by paper

340
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,199
airplane

341
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,959
the patronus is also used for other

342
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,399
things but

343
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,959
the patronus was used when the ministry

344
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,560
fell

345
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:54,319
for those that do know the actual movies

346
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:59,839
and that one was that one was kind of a

347
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,839
cool instance

348
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
step five is the pre-post environment so

349
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,319
this is where you're actually setting up

350
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,480
your environment for deployment

351
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,000
so this is the first step first time we

352
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,600
see the word ops this

353
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,160
is where we're actually setting up the

354
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:19,040
operational environment

355
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,639
for getting it ready to for actual

356
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,920
deployment this is where you're setting

357
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,199
up your space

358
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,519
for storing it for deployment so some of

359
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,479
the

360
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:30,399
some of the actual software that can be

361
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,519
used for setting up your operational

362
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:35,759
environment

363
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:38,720
include rockspace azure vmware

364
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,000
aws jira these are all the different

365
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,079
software tools that can be

366
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,079
used for setting up your environment

367
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:50,480
but these also have

368
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,560
security concerns make sure that however

369
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,440
you set it up make sure you think about

370
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,680
security

371
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:59,600
very first place very first time you

372
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,599
think about your operational environment

373
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:10,000
step five this is where

374
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:12,240
ron and hermione and harry they are

375
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,360
they have to start thinking about okay

376
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:18,399
yes we have to

377
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:22,240
they're they're starting to think okay

378
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:25,120
we have to

379
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,480
collect they're they're collecting their

380
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,600
their friends together

381
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:32,639
and they're going to become the army

382
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,639
to to fight evil they're they know

383
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,680
that they are going to be the ones who

384
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:40,320
have to fight

385
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:44,079
the bad people who are coming

386
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:47,920
to hurt the magical world

387
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:51,680
and they know that right now

388
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:55,040
there is no one who really can protect

389
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:59,279
them except for harry

390
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:02,319
and so they're only kids

391
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:04,959
but they know that they are the ones who

392
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,600
have to do what

393
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,640
has to be done unfortunately a lot of

394
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:12,799
people

395
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:15,839
are against them but they

396
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:18,319
they are the ones that that know that

397
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,159
they're they're starting their baseline

398
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,520
their beginning environment here at

399
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,600
school

400
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:29,120
and so um that's this is the

401
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:32,159
beginning environment right here okay

402
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:35,199
um acceptance testing

403
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,679
this is where you are you've got your

404
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,039
your environment set up and you have

405
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,400
your test teams

406
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:45,280
um use the environment your

407
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,080
you have the package is ready to deploy

408
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,720
but you're using

409
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,639
tests to make sure and use the promoted

410
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,400
builds to make sure that once it's

411
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,919
actually through the test

412
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:59,280
that the tests can go to the next phase

413
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:02,400
it's going and saying yes it's

414
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:05,678
past this so we can go to the next phase

415
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:09,600
yes it's got everything

416
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:12,799
ready to deploy it but again

417
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,799
everything has to be

418
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,520
going and going and going but it has to

419
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,120
be tested

420
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:24,160
and secured along the way

421
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:27,280
and before you can actually

422
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:31,039
continue on it has to be

423
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:34,960
approved by the customer or

424
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:38,320
whoever is saying this is what i want

425
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,720
to go to the next phase so it has to be

426
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,480
through the acceptance part before it

427
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,200
gets to the next phase

428
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,480
so whoever has made that decision to say

429
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,760
this is what

430
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:52,720
is in this acceptance

431
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,919
testing or the requirements for this

432
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,880
acceptance

433
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:59,360
you have to make sure that those tests

434
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,360
are here

435
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:08,000
for harry potter they have their testing

436
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:12,240
they have what they call owl

437
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:15,520
or ordinary wizarding level tests

438
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:18,799
and they have newts

439
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:22,480
nastily exhausting

440
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:24,000
wizarding tests that they take at the

441
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:28,400
end of their seventh year

442
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:31,919
at hogwarts um each one

443
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:35,760
well owls lead up to the the newts

444
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:38,960
and if you pass your owls

445
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,799
with so many you can actually go to a

446
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:45,120
certain career

447
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:48,400
and if you get so many

448
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:52,639
newts then you can actually

449
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:55,440
get the career that you want but

450
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,799
it doesn't always work out because there

451
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,640
have been

452
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,639
there were cases in both the books and

453
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:04,080
the movies where certain

454
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:06,080
students didn't actually finish

455
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,439
their exams or they didn't actually

456
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:11,120
finish

457
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:14,480
even hogwarts school um

458
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:18,158
for instance two of the brothers of

459
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:20,640
one of our three didn't even finish

460
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,960
school at all they didn't even they took

461
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:26,480
their exams but they didn't even finish

462
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:32,000
school so um but

463
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:35,919
they opened up a very famous wizarding

464
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,000
s um wizarding weasley's wizard wheezes

465
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:41,440
and they became very famous and

466
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:45,200
very rich um

467
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:48,400
so they didn't have to actually finish

468
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:51,120
hogwarts these these two but

469
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,799
normally you would have to finish at a

470
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:56,158
wizarding school

471
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:58,799
so just just take that into account that

472
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,440
these two didn't have to finish their

473
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,639
their

474
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:06,480
their tests

475
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:08,159
step seven um

476
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,480
so this is the production environment

477
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:13,360
this is where everything that was

478
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,000
ready to be deployed to the operational

479
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,479
environment

480
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,919
is is in the the operational environment

481
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,440
ready to deploy

482
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:25,120
is saved so again this is with

483
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:28,640
rockspace the azure the vmware

484
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,520
the aws and the jira everything that is

485
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,120
now

486
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:36,400
there in in the operational environment

487
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:38,799
this is where everything is now

488
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,440
everything's gone through all your steps

489
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,960
and is

490
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:45,360
there you've it's your customer

491
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,200
has got it there it's all there and

492
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:50,320
ready to go to your customer

493
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:53,760
so how do you get it from there

494
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:56,559
is it is it secured is it now

495
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,360
all to the point where it's in the right

496
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,879
format

497
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:04,000
is it is everything tested

498
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:07,200
fully and is it

499
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,880
in the right place in formats

500
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,480
everything ready for your customer to go

501
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,080
to go to your customer

502
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:16,400
is it so you

503
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,000
there's still steps at this point even

504
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,320
though it's the last step

505
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,440
there's things you have to think about

506
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,799
so

507
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:27,520
you know you have to think about

508
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:31,520
security even at this point

509
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:35,280
but this this is where it has

510
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:38,879
we have to think about the harry potter

511
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:41,840
because they they

512
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,120
they beat the voldemort and the death

513
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,559
eaters which

514
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,520
they were the bad guys that i talked

515
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,520
about they were the

516
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:53,120
the really really bad guys um

517
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,720
hermione went back to school she took

518
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,799
her test

519
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,200
after voldemort was killed he was the

520
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:02,559
really really bad guy

521
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,400
ron became an auror

522
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:07,039
he was a dark wizard catcher he went

523
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:10,320
around and he caught all the bad guys

524
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:12,640
he married hermione she became a

525
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,240
minister for magic she became the the

526
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,960
head of all the magi

527
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,960
all the wizards

528
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,679
harry became the r and married ron's

529
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:27,120
sister

530
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:28,880
but this wasn't the end so ron never

531
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:32,000
went back to school

532
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:35,120
harry never went back to school

533
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:39,600
but hermione did

534
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:42,080
so not everybody has to finish

535
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,279
um at least that's the way they did it

536
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,080
in harry potter i mean

537
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:47,200
they were able to do what they wanted to

538
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,220
do

539
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,159
without having to finish the whole

540
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:55,600
[Music]

541
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,600
the whole process

542
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:03,520
so if we look at this it's

543
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:06,240
this is my the whole steps in review

544
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,799
i mean check out and build code see them

545
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,080
and build

546
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:13,200
code students get ready to go to school

547
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:16,799
unit testing run unit tests

548
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:19,919
students get sorted into houses

549
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:21,679
the code quality use code code quality

550
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,240
analysis tools

551
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,880
everyone makes mistakes even in harry

552
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:31,039
potter world

553
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:34,159
in devsecops package

554
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:36,559
uh deliver code for release

555
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,480
um in harry potter owl delivery just

556
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:41,918
think of it that way

557
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,440
and pre-post environment set up your

558
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,240
environment for deplo

559
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,960
deploying to the operational but that's

560
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,039
the setup

561
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,720
phase for harry potter world

562
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,240
they were just getting ready to fight

563
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:58,640
this was the students

564
00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:01,919
teaching themselves and

565
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:04,240
the next acceptance testing phase

566
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,360
and that's where the the tools are

567
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,799
getting ready

568
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:12,158
to deploy um

569
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:15,600
that's where the owls are they take

570
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:18,000
their owl and their nude exams

571
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,080
and then for the production environment

572
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,559
that's where the code is ready to

573
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,559
deploy to the operational environment

574
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:27,760
but there's still

575
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:30,320
security needs to be done

576
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,960
and then for the harry potter evil's

577
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,678
gone

578
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,039
but they continue to live their lives

579
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,600
through their kids

580
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:39,600
not sure if you caught that that picture

581
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,158
i had on that last page

582
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,120
all the harry potter people they all had

583
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,000
their own kids

584
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,439
and they all went off to harry potter or

585
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,840
to hogwarts

586
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,799
and their kids went off to hogwarts and

587
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,279
lived on

588
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,279
through them

589
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:59,039
so my conclusion even

590
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,120
though all steps are recommended to make

591
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:03,840
a secure software package

592
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,360
all not all programs can implement it in

593
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,600
the very beginning

594
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,719
and as we saw through harry potter good

595
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,199
one in the end

596
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,200
but not everyone completed the steps in

597
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,799
order to graduate

598
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,039
so if your program can start with

599
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:20,559
verifying build files

600
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:22,559
they can add unit tests and and

601
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:24,799
it will depend on how much your customer

602
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:26,080
is requiring how much time you have to

603
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:29,760
implement

604
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:33,199
but in the end try not to bypass any

605
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:36,720
best cyber practices and make sure you

606
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,480
include all the security that you can at

607
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,640
every single step throughout the

608
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:43,520
practice every single step

609
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:46,640
don't don't forget any security

610
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:49,120
throughout the process

611
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,279
so if you have any questions again my

612
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:55,039
name is marion watick

613
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:57,919
that is my hacker handle on twitter

614
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:59,360
so if there's any questions you can hit

615
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:04,159
me up

616
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:04,158
later on thank you
