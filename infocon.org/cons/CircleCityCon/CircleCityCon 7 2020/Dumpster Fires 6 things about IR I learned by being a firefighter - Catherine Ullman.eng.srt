1
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:11,340
please welcome Catherine home into the

2
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,160
stream with their talk dumpster fires

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:20,160
six things I learned about ir by being a

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:22,470
firefighter hello everybody and big

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,550
thank you to circle city con for having

6
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:28,049
me here today as the introduction stated

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,720
I'm going to talk a little bit about

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,070
some things that I learned about being a

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,989
firefighter I've been a volunteer

10
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:38,040
firefighter for a number of years now

11
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:41,399
and thankfully I've learned things from

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,739
that I guess you'd call it hobby that

13
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,730
I've brought into my day job so let's

14
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:49,530
see what we're gonna talk about tonight

15
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:52,440
so here's our agenda I'll do a little

16
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:55,410
intro a little about me we'll talk about

17
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:58,070
what I are really is some firefighting

18
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:01,559
stuff some differences and similarities

19
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:03,270
between the two some challenges and

20
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:05,610
opportunities that I've learned I'll

21
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:10,409
give you a short summary and some final

22
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:12,600
thoughts all right so this is a little

23
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:14,400
about me if any of you have met me or

24
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,189
heard me speak in the past most of you

25
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,189
know I'm on staff and involved with a

26
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:21,960
number of different cons I volunteer all

27
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:25,048
over the place I'm actually volunteering

28
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,908
with Circle City Con today as well I've

29
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:29,299
spoken into some places and I've got

30
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:31,860
some certs and some degrees and things

31
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:34,560
this is the slide most of you probably

32
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:37,170
don't know about me if you had met me in

33
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,350
the past I am technically a state

34
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:42,899
certified fire instructor and I have a

35
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:45,780
bunch of credits toward a community

36
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:47,790
college degree I was a certified fire

37
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,630
investigator at both levels in the state

38
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:54,479
of New York and I also have my

39
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:57,240
certification as a fire instructor and I

40
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,860
was a member of Jay fire so I've been in

41
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,710
the firefighting community it's been

42
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:04,590
about 24 years that I've been doing this

43
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,389
and as if those of you who happen to

44
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,060
hear Alyssa's talk this morning about

45
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:11,340
making parallels between one thing that

46
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,959
you're passionate about and taking them

47
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,670
to

48
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:16,280
another thing you're passionate about I

49
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:19,640
think that finding those parallels can

50
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:22,489
be very instructive so for anyone who

51
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:26,089
doesn't necessarily believe she's not

52
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:28,430
really a firefighter okay well here I am

53
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:30,019
I am right in the middle there I'm

54
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:33,439
holding what's called a thermal camera

55
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:36,260
which is a camera that allows us to see

56
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:38,900
different gradations of temperature so

57
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:41,480
things that are very hot will show up as

58
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:43,790
more of a white color and things that

59
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,069
are cooler will show up as varying

60
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:47,780
shades of grey darker as they it's

61
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:52,548
cooler so it's really just showing that

62
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:54,620
differentiation okay so now let's get

63
00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:56,959
into some of the meat and potatoes

64
00:02:54,620 --> 00:03:00,379
what exactly is incident response

65
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,790
because not everybody knows so this is

66
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:03,379
what I'm going to use as a basic

67
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:05,328
definition of an incident response

68
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:07,250
it's these technical components that we

69
00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:10,040
need to analyze and contain an incident

70
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:12,049
ideally from going further and what does

71
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,480
that entail well it means we're going to

72
00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:17,750
address Network events we can

73
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,328
proactively or reactively respond to

74
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:23,599
them and it's any event that can affect

75
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:25,370
the CIA triangle confidentiality

76
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,698
integrity and availability of that

77
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:30,560
information now I want to just quickly

78
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:32,000
note this differs slightly from incident

79
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,069
handling and we'll talk about that in a

80
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,419
minute

81
00:03:33,069 --> 00:03:37,790
these are the goals of incident response

82
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:40,549
right we want to make sure we know when

83
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:42,349
something has occurred if there's an

84
00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:44,449
attacker involved we want to stop them

85
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:46,759
we want to minimize any damage that they

86
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:48,979
might have caused and we're gonna follow

87
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:50,720
through to find out like you know what

88
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:53,199
happens so that we can prevent it from

89
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,180
happening in the future

90
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:59,120
these are your basic phases of Incident

91
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:01,009
Response you can see we have you know

92
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,019
preparation we're gonna identify things

93
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:05,358
contain them get rid of the bad guys

94
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:07,340
recover and we're gonna hopefully learn

95
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:10,400
some lessons from that experience which

96
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:12,859
will lead to better preparation this

97
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,479
just breaks down all of those stages and

98
00:04:12,859 --> 00:04:16,609
the kinds of things we do at each one

99
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:18,320
right so during that preparation stage

100
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:20,539
we're going to document the heck out of

101
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,029
everything because if you don't know

102
00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:24,780
what you have or where it is it's very

103
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:27,210
difficult to respond there's a

104
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:30,330
problem we might build some tools we

105
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:32,969
might not only build tools but we might

106
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:34,620
take some tools that we just bought and

107
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:36,900
put them in place or we might be

108
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,419
researching and and deciding on some

109
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:41,340
tools we're going to be aware of the

110
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:42,659
attacks we're gonna find some mechanism

111
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,669
to tell us whether it's an external

112
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,770
entity or we have systems in place that

113
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:49,799
are telling us there's a problem the way

114
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:52,710
will contain obviously is will say patch

115
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,720
things will block a situ traffic will

116
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:57,359
pull a power chord if it's necessary and

117
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,460
to get rid of the attacker we're gonna

118
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,320
do some form of remediation maybe take a

119
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,690
compromised host off the network and

120
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:06,870
recovering is all about restoring those

121
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:09,540
business functions so obviously if you

122
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:11,970
are in a situation where you have a

123
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:14,280
department go down or a process that's

124
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:17,580
on that is affected we need to make sure

125
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,140
those things are back online then we

126
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,150
want to take what we've learned from all

127
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:25,380
of this so that we don't make that same

128
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:27,900
mistake a second time here's the reason

129
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:30,090
why I separated Incident Response and

130
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,919
incident handling now in small

131
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:33,479
organizations it's impossible to

132
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,359
separate these because there just isn't

133
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:37,919
the manpower but ideally if you have a

134
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,840
large enough organization you really

135
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,150
want somebody else doing the incident

136
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:45,119
handling this is the logistics and

137
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:47,880
communications coordinating planning all

138
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,979
the things that go into resolving an

139
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,750
incident if you're the person who's

140
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:54,030
doing Incident Response you are

141
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:56,789
typically boots on the ground working on

142
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:59,219
that response you don't also want to be

143
00:05:56,789 --> 00:06:01,830
reporting to somebody right in front of

144
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,539
you who keeps asking you when are you

145
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:06,060
gonna be done when are you gonna be done

146
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:08,219
what's going on and so ideally you want

147
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,919
someone else handling that side of it

148
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,910
and we'll see how that parallels some of

149
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:14,419
the things that I've learned is a

150
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:18,690
firefighter in just a minute

151
00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:20,810
so as parallels go let's now talk about

152
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:24,120
what firefighting is which may seem

153
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:27,120
somewhat obvious right it's the attack

154
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:29,760
it's the attempt to prevent the spread

155
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,400
of additional fire we want to extinguish

156
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:35,250
an unwanted fire and I specify unwanted

157
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,679
because some of us might have a barbecue

158
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,070
pit right and we want that fire we want

159
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,600
to cook

160
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:41,580
food over it but we don't necessarily

161
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,700
want our house on fire

162
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:47,250
we don't want our garage on fire

163
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:49,080
you know our vehicle on fire or just you

164
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:51,420
know a fire in the woods behind us

165
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,039
that's out of control so you know for

166
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:56,070
what it's worth that's how I'm defining

167
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:58,440
it so what are our goals as firefighters

168
00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:00,500
but our number one goal is to protect

169
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,440
the health and safety of ourselves and

170
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:07,170
others so others including the public

171
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,800
and including our other members of our

172
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:12,630
firefighting team we want to protect

173
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:15,270
everybody and you know their property

174
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:16,440
private property public property we want

175
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:20,820
to make sure to protect the environment

176
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:22,920
when you put water on a fire if you put

177
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:25,020
it on the kind of fire it shouldn't be

178
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:27,240
on because there are fires we don't put

179
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:29,700
out with water we could actually cause a

180
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:33,090
bigger problem then you mean too by

181
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:35,580
allowing chemicals that are runoff to

182
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:37,530
get into streams we want to also

183
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:40,950
minimize disruption of the community

184
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:43,830
right so if there is a major fire you've

185
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:45,780
probably had to be rerouted whether it's

186
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:47,219
maybe down a different Street maybe

187
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:49,440
you've had get off a highway somewhere

188
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:51,480
because there's been a car fire or

189
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:56,160
something so we want to minimize those

190
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:58,230
things so we also have a similar cycle

191
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,000
that is called the preparedness cycle

192
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:04,680
and this really comes from the more

193
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,050
general idea of Incident Response for

194
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,640
firefighters which we'll just see in a

195
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:10,950
moment but you'll see it's very similar

196
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:13,409
right we've got preparation we have

197
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:17,070
something that happens in emergency we

198
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:18,720
have a response we recover we consider

199
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:23,190
mitigation and we're right back to

200
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,510
preparation again so what do we mean in

201
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,650
terms of firefighting in these

202
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:27,990
particular things

203
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:30,960
well mitigation as you'll see is about

204
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:33,390
preventing future emergencies or

205
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,299
minimizing their facts so you'll often

206
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:41,010
see firefighters who are doing

207
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:43,140
educational in educational different

208
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:46,470
kinds of events so maybe an open house

209
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:49,439
maybe they go to schools they hand out

210
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:50,570
smoke detectors we make sure sprinklers

211
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,420
are in place

212
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:55,850
then our preparedness are things like we

213
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:57,469
maintain our gear we're gonna prepare to

214
00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:00,350
handle that emergency we do what's

215
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:01,490
called pre-planning for buildings so

216
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:03,350
we're gonna take a look and we're gonna

217
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:05,000
see in terms of those buildings are

218
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:07,010
there problems with that building that

219
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,830
if there was a fire would be difficult

220
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:12,410
to access maybe its wires that are in

221
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:13,940
front of it maybe it's the fact that the

222
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:16,100
streets really narrow

223
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:19,339
maybe the houses are very close together

224
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:21,230
in terms of response that's the actual

225
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:23,180
responding to the emergency our goal

226
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:25,940
there of course is to save property and

227
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:28,310
lives including our own and then the

228
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:30,920
recovery so we're gonna clean up we're

229
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:33,319
gonna you know make sure that we at

230
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:35,660
least clean up as much as we can and

231
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,190
then it could be other entities come in

232
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:42,709
to help with restoration and doing

233
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:44,540
repairs so this is another slide from

234
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:46,460
the same fire that we saw in the very

235
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:48,589
beginning and I'm going to tell you a

236
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:51,830
little story and then later I'll tell

237
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:54,890
you how it ends so here I'm just doing

238
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:57,170
my job in the picture on the left I'm

239
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:59,089
the person behind

240
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:02,150
there's a gentleman sort of leaning over

241
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:04,370
and what I am doing is I am changing his

242
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:06,980
air bottle air bottles are what

243
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:09,440
firefighters use to go into those smoky

244
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:11,450
environment environments so that we

245
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,250
don't breathe in those toxic chemicals

246
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:16,610
but they're only good for a certain

247
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:18,800
period of time most bottles these days

248
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:20,959
are like thirty roughly thirty minutes

249
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,150
some are forty-five and that's what

250
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:25,339
they're rated for but most people wind

251
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:26,930
up using them a lot faster when a

252
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:30,890
firefighter starts to run out of air

253
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:33,739
they come out and somebody who is in

254
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:35,600
charge of changing the bottle takes the

255
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:37,490
bottle out of the harness you can see

256
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,010
the little bit of the harness on the

257
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:43,520
picture on the right and replaces it

258
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:45,350
with a fresh bottle so this was my job

259
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,569
at that fire at that moment I was

260
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:49,540
replacing bottles for interior

261
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:54,260
firefighters who were coming in and

262
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:56,569
needed fresh oxygen so as you can see

263
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:58,160
I'm left that's what I'm doing I want

264
00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:00,350
you to pay special attention to the

265
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,270
picture on the right I want you to

266
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:03,570
notice the blackening in the shoulder of

267
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:06,689
the firefighter

268
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:12,650
and I want you to notice closely how

269
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:16,110
deep it is and how far back it goes and

270
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:17,880
unfortunately what happened as I was

271
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:19,740
changing his bottle is something that I

272
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,760
won't forget and it's something that

273
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:27,960
actually was the impetus for this talk

274
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:29,700
so we'll come back to that all right so

275
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:32,610
in firefighting we have something called

276
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:34,080
the incident command system for those of

277
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:36,810
you in the military this should be

278
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:38,850
fairly similar to things that you've

279
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:42,150
experienced because this is our chain of

280
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:45,510
command and we like to refer to this as

281
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:49,230
the organized response to a problem it's

282
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:51,840
how we organize who does what at a scene

283
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:54,570
and this is really helpful and I think

284
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:58,070
we could find some use for this in our

285
00:11:54,570 --> 00:12:01,290
Incident Response system in computing

286
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:03,510
this is what it looks like you'll notice

287
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:06,300
that for every particular individual

288
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:08,670
involved there are not a ton of people

289
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:11,339
underneath and that's part of what makes

290
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:13,949
this really really effective the

291
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:19,230
incident commander only has a couple of

292
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:20,790
people under under them and the thing

293
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:22,950
that they're going to focus on is the

294
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:25,140
big picture and these other folks are

295
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:26,070
going to take pieces of that big picture

296
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:29,550
and it's going to be their

297
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:32,010
responsibility so for example at a fire

298
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:33,680
the section that we focus on the most is

299
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:36,480
probably going to be operations

300
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,219
operations are much like our incident

301
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,770
responders who are boots on the ground

302
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:43,050
and they're directing exactly what needs

303
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:44,670
to happen as guided by the incident

304
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:48,209
commander so what does that look like

305
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:51,030
more in detail so this is breaking that

306
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:53,400
down your I see your incident commander

307
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:55,170
is going to define the overall goal and

308
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,959
operational objectives and it might be

309
00:12:55,170 --> 00:13:01,530
overall for an entire fire it might be

310
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:03,600
for a subsection of a fire depending on

311
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:06,630
what the focus is for the IC at the

312
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,460
moment but then operations is going to

313
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:10,680
take that information and determine the

314
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:13,800
actual strategy and tactics that go into

315
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:15,530
exactly what the teams are going to do

316
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,750
so who's going to go in and

317
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:18,860
are they gonna knock down a wall is

318
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:21,050
somebody gonna take out a window

319
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:23,960
howard's ventilation gonna happen those

320
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:25,849
kinds of things there are also people in

321
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:28,040
very large incidents especially that

322
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:29,930
handles specifically logistics do we

323
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,699
need more people are there special

324
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:33,469
supplies and equipment that need to be

325
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,270
brought in for that particular incident

326
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:37,520
then there's somebody who handles

327
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:40,939
planning what if this is a big big

328
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:42,980
incident so the ICS system was used for

329
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:45,680
things like Hurricane Katrina so

330
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:47,180
long-range planning and the ultimate

331
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,449
demobilization of that planning

332
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:52,430
someone's got to do that too so and then

333
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:54,350
in terms of money money's got to come

334
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:56,540
from somewhere so again especially when

335
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:58,550
it's a larger incident you might need

336
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:00,469
money to buy things so they take care of

337
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:01,790
compliance and licenses and and all

338
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:05,630
those little administrative details

339
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:10,430
which can be significant all right so

340
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:13,220
let's do some comparing so in terms of

341
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:14,599
methodology you'll see that these while

342
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:17,840
they're in a slightly different order

343
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,400
there's preparation involved in both you

344
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:21,350
have some form of response and

345
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:24,650
mitigation whether we call it mitigation

346
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:27,410
or containment we're going to be doing

347
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:28,970
some form of recovery and I added less

348
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:32,300
and learn to firefight even though it's

349
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:34,520
not officially in that circle because

350
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:37,520
realistically we do come back to the

351
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:40,939
firehouse and we typically do spend a

352
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:43,460
bunch of time as soon as we kind of get

353
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:46,580
back and clean up and and maybe not the

354
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:48,530
same day maybe it's the next day we talk

355
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:50,420
about what happened and how we could do

356
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:52,069
it better next time and what went wrong

357
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:54,050
and what went right so we're doing

358
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:58,310
lessons learned even if it's not part of

359
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:59,290
that formal cycle here are some things

360
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:01,459
that I think are interesting

361
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:05,089
misconceptions about both

362
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:07,160
so for Incident Response not every event

363
00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:09,740
is an incident but a lot of people think

364
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:12,020
that's the case we get lots and lots of

365
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:14,540
events right things that could

366
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:18,050
potentially have an impact on our CI a

367
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:20,780
triangle but don't necessarily and we

368
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:21,469
don't really handle an incident the same

369
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,780
way every time

370
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:25,100
I mean sometimes we do right there are

371
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,400
certain things that are the same every

372
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,830
time

373
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,420
there are lots of times where you see

374
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:31,980
something you've never seen before and

375
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,020
so then you have to figure out what

376
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,640
you're gonna do with it

377
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:37,500
we know those of us who've been doing

378
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,689
this a while it is not the case that

379
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,640
every incident gets solved quickly right

380
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:43,890
there are some you can just you know

381
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:46,939
quickly shut right down and then there

382
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:49,530
are others it could take weeks or months

383
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:52,380
the thing that I want to bring out here

384
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:54,780
is this next point there is the thought

385
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:56,520
that everybody on an IR team needs to be

386
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,300
a rock star and I'll tell you what it's

387
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,160
not true

388
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,569
we need lots of different people who are

389
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,880
good at lots of different things for

390
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:04,380
Incident Response and some people are

391
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,640
really good at some things and some

392
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,040
people are really good at other things

393
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:11,280
and we need to be cognizant of our

394
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:14,370
strengths among those people so that we

395
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:18,260
can best utilize those resources we also

396
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:21,210
can't always attribute what happened

397
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:22,980
accurately it's really sometimes very

398
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:24,930
difficult I was talking about this with

399
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:27,690
somebody earlier today in a chat that

400
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:29,219
you know attributions tough and and yes

401
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:32,340
there are times when we can figure out

402
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:34,500
exactly you know who the bad actor was

403
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:37,710
and exactly how they get in but not

404
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:40,170
always and there's some some parallel

405
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:42,210
misconceptions to firefighting did you

406
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:44,969
know that firefighters are not always

407
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:46,680
paid as a volunteer firefighter I don't

408
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:49,140
make a dime and neither does anybody

409
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:51,890
else in my entire department we have

410
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:55,590
four fire companies that each have

411
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:57,900
twenty to thirty five forty members so

412
00:16:55,590 --> 00:17:00,390
we're talking over a hundred people they

413
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:03,600
don't get paid a dime for saving your

414
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:05,940
life that's it that's that's it we do it

415
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:09,720
because we enjoy it it's something that

416
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:12,450
we have really taken on as part of who

417
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,459
we are now what does that sound like an

418
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:17,670
incident response anybody out there ever

419
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:20,430
feel that way about security I mean I

420
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:23,670
don't know is sort of how I feel right

421
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:26,280
it's just part of who I am obviously

422
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:30,750
firefighters yeah not always big tough

423
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:32,580
dudes not a big tough dude right here we

424
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,050
also don't fight every fire the same way

425
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:36,659
in the same way that we don't do that

426
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:39,928
with Incident Response yes we have

427
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:42,629
certain things that we pay attention

428
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:46,139
- and certain methodologies that we

429
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:48,629
follow but we're going to we're going to

430
00:17:46,139 --> 00:17:50,519
let the facts and the details of the

431
00:17:48,629 --> 00:17:52,199
scene dictate how we're going to fight

432
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:55,379
that fire and we're going to let that

433
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:58,649
incident command structure help clarify

434
00:17:55,379 --> 00:18:00,748
those particular details we definitely

435
00:17:58,649 --> 00:18:02,459
don't extinguish every fire quickly in

436
00:18:00,749 --> 00:18:04,980
fact the fire that I showed you the

437
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,820
picture of earlier on we were there

438
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,809
about four hours

439
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:12,509
it was a long fire and it was a mess and

440
00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:14,279
it's also not a full-time job again it's

441
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:16,590
something I do as a volunteer and I put

442
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:22,200
a lot of hours in but my day job is

443
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:24,059
doing Incident Response and security so

444
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:28,080
here are some really important

445
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:30,570
distinctions between the two IR doesn't

446
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,730
usually involve life safety now that's

447
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:34,678
not true in health care right so for

448
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:36,990
those of you working in hospitals or

449
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:39,269
clinics or you have anything to do with

450
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,440
life safety you can truly say if

451
00:18:39,269 --> 00:18:43,769
something goes wrong

452
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:46,350
you know this is a life threat but at

453
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:49,289
the University where I work

454
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:51,869
I'm frequently telling people no one

455
00:18:49,289 --> 00:18:53,340
will die because the network is

456
00:18:51,869 --> 00:18:56,189
unavailable because something went wrong

457
00:18:53,340 --> 00:19:00,360
right so you have to think in terms of

458
00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:03,240
risk how serious the risk is this IR

459
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:05,519
teams typically are paid most fire

460
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:09,509
departments that aren't in major cities

461
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:11,100
in New York State are not paid and

462
00:19:09,509 --> 00:19:13,440
that's true in other places around the

463
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:15,480
country certainly if firefighters have

464
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,330
gear and Weez all kinds of equipment

465
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,559
like that camera I showed you earlier

466
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:21,658
and I our teams are going to be using

467
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:25,649
the computers and software and not so

468
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:28,769
much hoses we as a firefighter we wear

469
00:19:25,649 --> 00:19:31,080
our special gear as an IR person I'm

470
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:32,220
wearing what's comfortable especially if

471
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,249
it's going to be something where I'm

472
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:36,929
working for hours we sometimes show up

473
00:19:35,249 --> 00:19:38,820
in special vehicles as firefighters all

474
00:19:36,929 --> 00:19:40,980
right big fire trucks ambulances things

475
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,269
that make a lot of noise and of course

476
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,279
as a firefighter we're going to use

477
00:19:42,269 --> 00:19:47,220
water foam and chemicals and things to

478
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:49,019
take down fires we aren't going to do

479
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,519
the same kind of firefighting we're not

480
00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:52,470
going to pull a plug in quite the same

481
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:53,820
way although I've certainly been on

482
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:55,410
situations that were like

483
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:59,939
fires were part of taking that fire out

484
00:19:55,410 --> 00:20:01,710
was literally pulling the plug here are

485
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,480
some similarities I think that are worth

486
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:06,600
noting and this is really what's going

487
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:10,020
to lead into some of these things that I

488
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:12,270
learned right in both cases we need to

489
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:14,730
focus on that immediate issue first and

490
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:16,650
figure the cause out later as someone

491
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:18,630
who's been doing both firefighting and

492
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:21,030
fire investigation for a long time I

493
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:22,980
don't do anything with fire

494
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:26,760
investigation directly until the fire is

495
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:28,470
out and even when it's out yes I'm

496
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,870
making mental notes of what I'm seeing

497
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:33,390
but I may not be changing anything or

498
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:35,010
doing anything further that's really the

499
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:37,680
same an incident response right in some

500
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:40,070
cases we don't pull the plug because we

501
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:42,810
need to see what the attacker is doing

502
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:44,639
we're gonna use triage and for those of

503
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:47,580
you not familiar with the term triage

504
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,260
it's just this idea where you have a lot

505
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:52,290
of things coming at you in an incident

506
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:54,300
in a fire scene or an accident this is

507
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:56,010
probably the easiest way to understand

508
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,600
it let's say there's a motor vehicle

509
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:59,879
accident which is one of the things

510
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:03,540
firefighters are often assisting with

511
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:05,790
and you have multiple victims if there's

512
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:08,550
only say one or two of you and there's

513
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:10,680
five victims not everybody can get help

514
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:13,470
right away who do you help first

515
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:15,480
so triage involves this idea of

516
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:18,320
considering the risk for each one of

517
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:23,370
those patients if you have a patient who

518
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:25,860
literally just appears to be decapitated

519
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:28,560
something like really significant like

520
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:30,840
that you can't save that person they're

521
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:35,250
gone and you might have somebody who's

522
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:38,639
screaming in pain but they're seemingly

523
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:41,010
reasonably functional you might not want

524
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,080
to focus on them and instead focus on

525
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:46,170
somebody who has a significant leg wound

526
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:49,620
that over a short period of time they

527
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:52,290
could bleed out right so it's not unlike

528
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:54,389
an incident response situation maybe you

529
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:56,100
need to focus on a server and not

530
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:56,880
necessarily a workstation or the other

531
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,800
way around

532
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,420
but you need to triage you need to go

533
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,820
through and you need to decide which of

534
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:06,570
these things needs critical help and

535
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:08,639
needs it first that's the whole idea

536
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:11,220
it's cyclic in nature we've already seen

537
00:22:08,639 --> 00:22:13,979
those cycles in terms of you know we go

538
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:15,299
through these patterns and we start with

539
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:18,269
some sort of documentation and

540
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:21,389
pre-planning and ideally we learn

541
00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:23,279
something in the end we also need to

542
00:22:21,389 --> 00:22:25,080
think outside the box as incident

543
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:27,690
responders because sometimes things are

544
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:30,210
not so straightforward a great example

545
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:31,950
of that in the fire service is not just

546
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:34,710
putting out fires but sometimes rescuing

547
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:37,649
people I have a friend who's with

548
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:40,590
another fire department where they also

549
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:43,830
do emergency response with the ambulance

550
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:45,779
and they had a very large gentleman that

551
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:48,360
they needed to get out of the second or

552
00:22:45,779 --> 00:22:51,120
third floor of a building and they had

553
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:54,870
no way easy way to get him out of there

554
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:58,258
so what they did is he thought outside

555
00:22:54,870 --> 00:23:00,840
the box and he went to the local

556
00:22:58,259 --> 00:23:03,690
hardware store and he bought a whole

557
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:05,970
bunch of wood and they built something

558
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:07,860
to help get this gentleman out an

559
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:10,259
incident response it's not so different

560
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:12,539
sometimes we use tools and ways that we

561
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:15,720
never thought we'd be using them just to

562
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:17,580
find information out or to get something

563
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:20,309
back up and running again it's not

564
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:21,720
unusual for for those of us in Incident

565
00:23:20,309 --> 00:23:24,000
Response to use tools in a slightly

566
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,980
different way and I'm seeing more and

567
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,039
more and I think this is fantastic

568
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:31,590
that Red Team tools folks are learning

569
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:34,049
in the blue team side how to use those

570
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:36,090
tools to understand where their

571
00:23:34,049 --> 00:23:39,360
vulnerabilities are right so this is an

572
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:41,250
example of that we often bring in

573
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,080
outside entities if you're in an

574
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:45,179
organization and you have a significant

575
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:47,370
breach you might be calling in somebody

576
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:48,750
like mandiant or your insurance company

577
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:52,768
might be calling in somebody like ma'am

578
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:55,440
you in fire service same thing we might

579
00:23:52,769 --> 00:23:57,570
not have enough manpower to handle the

580
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,610
incident in question so we bring in an

581
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:02,879
outside agency maybe we need the police

582
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:04,949
to help us - maybe we need a helicopter

583
00:24:02,879 --> 00:24:06,178
for some reason all of these things

584
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:08,730
involve bringing in these outside

585
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:11,789
entities and sometimes those in-house

586
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:13,830
teams there are factories that have

587
00:24:11,789 --> 00:24:16,169
their own firefighting team because they

588
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:17,939
know they can get to whatever it is

589
00:24:16,169 --> 00:24:18,950
inside a lot faster than waiting for

590
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:21,200
somebody to show up

591
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:22,310
same thing with incident response right

592
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,500
sometimes you have a team that's

593
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:25,700
internal or maybe you have you know one

594
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,770
or two people that are at least your

595
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:30,820
point people so those are some

596
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:34,450
significant similarities

597
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:36,678
all right now getting to the challenges

598
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:39,650
remember that picture that I showed you

599
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:42,380
of the firefighter with a burn coat this

600
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:46,580
is a challenge this is where I ran into

601
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:48,260
tunnel vision my focus really was

602
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:50,840
changing that bottle right that was my

603
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:53,570
job but what I didn't notice was how

604
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:55,639
badly burned his coat was and as a

605
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:59,450
result I also didn't happen to notice

606
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:01,580
that the hose on his air pack had been

607
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:04,220
damaged when I went to put the new

608
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:05,030
bottle in place and snap it in and turn

609
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:07,750
the air on

610
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:11,120
I actually got hit with a blast of air

611
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:13,610
and thankfully my helmet was on and so

612
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,620
there was you know I had no injury no

613
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:18,260
damage there was nothing but think about

614
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:21,379
what could have happened right I was so

615
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:23,750
hyper focused on the job and the task at

616
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:26,840
hand I didn't take a step back and look

617
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:29,990
at that bigger picture so this is an

618
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,939
example of tunnel vision and thankfully

619
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:35,179
it ultimately didn't lead to anything

620
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:41,360
serious but it could have here's another

621
00:25:35,179 --> 00:25:43,100
example same fire different picture now

622
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,260
what you may or may not be able to see

623
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:47,899
in this picture if you look very closely

624
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,830
is that the cones in this image they're

625
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:52,070
protecting something

626
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:54,080
what are they protecting well like I

627
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:56,240
said you probably see maybe you can see

628
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,949
the hose but that's not really what

629
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:01,820
they're protecting what they're

630
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:04,400
protecting is a downed power line now if

631
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:06,230
you come up on that scene and you are so

632
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,929
hyper focused on putting that fire out

633
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:09,409
and running into that house what are the

634
00:26:08,929 --> 00:26:11,720
odds

635
00:26:09,409 --> 00:26:13,190
even with those cones there that you

636
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:17,270
might just run right into that

637
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:19,059
electrical line that's not good right so

638
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:21,799
we have this problem in the fire service

639
00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:25,158
so what it was my take away for that in

640
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:27,650
incident response guess what same thing

641
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:30,890
it's easy when there's an incident to go

642
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:33,650
running in but we should be thinking of

643
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:35,630
our own safety first and that includes

644
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:37,970
both our physical safety and our mental

645
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:39,679
well-being are you being brought in

646
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:42,770
because there might have something to do

647
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:45,380
with child pornography that can be

648
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:47,179
mentally very damaging are you walking

649
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:49,159
into a server room that maybe has

650
00:26:47,179 --> 00:26:51,500
asbestos like in that picture down on

651
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:53,210
the right because something's broken and

652
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,799
you need to walk in there we had a

653
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:56,659
situation with a server room only a

654
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,790
couple of years ago where there was

655
00:26:56,659 --> 00:27:00,290
flooding now imagine what that could

656
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:03,620
have been if you didn't realize it was

657
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:05,870
happening so it's important to think

658
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:07,668
about all of these things and consider

659
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:10,850
the bigger picture before you jump to

660
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:13,370
conclusions is an incident malware or

661
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:15,860
maybe something's just misconfigured are

662
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:18,110
you just blindly grabbing hardware to

663
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:20,030
acquire it for you know a forensic

664
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:23,418
investigation before thinking through

665
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:27,190
what that could ultimately do to the

666
00:27:23,419 --> 00:27:29,630
situation if you just pull that hardware

667
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:32,480
maybe it's encrypted and if you don't

668
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:35,030
get that key you're out of luck is what

669
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,490
your face was really ransomware or is it

670
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:40,970
just a phishing message it's really easy

671
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:43,100
to get caught up in the moment so here's

672
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:44,630
another challenge and you can see how

673
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:47,330
one kind of leads to the other right

674
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:52,190
this reactionary behavior outside

675
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:54,350
influences are really really forcing you

676
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:56,090
to make the wrong kinds of decisions

677
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:58,520
because you're not evaluating that big

678
00:27:56,090 --> 00:28:03,610
picture instead of thinking about any

679
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:06,679
kind of pre-planning or any sort of

680
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:09,620
documentation you have you're just

681
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:12,590
reacting and we do this all the time and

682
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:14,989
we do this in the fire service too here

683
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:17,689
is an example where reactionary behavior

684
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:19,520
did play a role this was a horrible fire

685
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:22,100
in Worcester Massachusetts that involved

686
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:24,950
a warehouse that warehouse was built in

687
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:27,709
1906 who was a meatpacking plant it

688
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:29,290
hadn't been in use for many many many

689
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:30,940
years but the

690
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:32,639
our department hadn't done any

691
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:35,110
pre-planning no one had been in it

692
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,630
nobody knew what was in it nobody knew

693
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:40,330
how it was structured and it turned out

694
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:44,080
there were mazes and mazes and mazes of

695
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:46,449
meat lockers so what happened she the

696
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,590
firefighters went in because they heard

697
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:51,340
there could have been somebody trapped

698
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:54,250
inside they get lost so then what

699
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:56,560
happens well the chief does what he

700
00:28:54,250 --> 00:29:03,100
always did sent in two more firefighters

701
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:05,350
who subsequently got lost and then they

702
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:07,689
sent in two more firefighters bet you

703
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:09,340
can guess what happened this was a very

704
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:12,550
very sad story and there were a lot of

705
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:14,409
reasons why this went badly but one of

706
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:17,800
them was that they did not have pre

707
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:20,830
plans for this fire and and so

708
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:22,960
ultimately six firefighters died the

709
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:26,830
fire chief after the sixth firefighter

710
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,780
went in said no more he a lot of the

711
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:30,220
firefighters on that scene were furious

712
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:31,960
because they wanted to save their

713
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:36,240
friends but the reality is it was too

714
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:39,160
late so this happens in the fire service

715
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:42,910
it also happens in incident response

716
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:45,430
right this is kind of what I learned if

717
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:47,080
you don't have for example clear goals

718
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:50,110
when you're doing a forensic response

719
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:53,409
you are gonna get lost lost in that

720
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:57,040
cloud you also can be asked for things

721
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:59,920
like find the bad stuff well that puts

722
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:01,899
you in a really awkward position you're

723
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,900
reacting because somebody says oh no

724
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:07,090
there's a problem find the bad stuff

725
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:10,600
force the issue to find out what exactly

726
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:11,830
are they trying to find right don't just

727
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,629
pull network connections

728
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:14,889
that's another reactionary behavior oh

729
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:16,690
the bad thing happened we must pull the

730
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:19,390
network connection but I mentioned

731
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:21,310
earlier what happened if what we need to

732
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:23,080
be able to do any sort of attribution or

733
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:26,919
find out more about exactly what's going

734
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:29,439
on what happens if I don't know we need

735
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:32,320
to know more pulling the plug might just

736
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,630
end that whole investigation the same

737
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,340
thing goes for turning off machines as I

738
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:37,930
said earlier what happens if that

739
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,439
machine was encrypted and you just turn

740
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:40,180
it off

741
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:42,970
you could have potentially pulled the

742
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:44,890
key from memory but now

743
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:46,870
you're out of luck or you could pull

744
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:51,460
information about the attacker out of

745
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:52,809
memory how about a situation where you

746
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:54,909
know there's an attacker in your network

747
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:57,549
and so you just suspend all the accounts

748
00:30:54,909 --> 00:31:00,610
instead of oh you know trying to figure

749
00:30:57,549 --> 00:31:01,720
out which account it is because o it is

750
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:03,908
the end of the world is there somebody

751
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:09,220
in the network so we do the same kinds

752
00:31:03,909 --> 00:31:12,070
of things and it's not ideal freelancing

753
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:14,140
I make a point of defining this

754
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:15,850
particular term because in our field

755
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:17,860
right there are lots of folks you do

756
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:18,570
freelance but they don't mean it this

757
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:21,610
way

758
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:23,740
they're usually folks who are being

759
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:25,330
hired in as contractors right and that's

760
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:27,549
kind of how we think of freelancing in

761
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:29,830
that universe but in the fire universe

762
00:31:27,549 --> 00:31:32,289
freelancing is not a good thing and this

763
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:35,049
is what we mean by freelancing it's this

764
00:31:32,289 --> 00:31:37,870
idea that somebody kind of goes off does

765
00:31:35,049 --> 00:31:39,639
their own thing decides what they should

766
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:41,889
do they don't follow chain command they

767
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:43,990
don't check in with anybody and they can

768
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:48,159
be downright dangerous for themselves or

769
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:52,840
others and interestingly enough we see

770
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:54,520
similar things in Incident Response so

771
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,949
here are some examples from firefighting

772
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:58,600
I thought this was appropriate for those

773
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:01,120
of you who don't know this is from

774
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:04,030
ghostbusters this whole idea of crossing

775
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:06,370
the streams right so in firefighting if

776
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:08,649
we have a hose line going in the front

777
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:10,689
door we really don't want a hose line

778
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:12,309
going in the back door because guess

779
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:15,190
what happens to the poor people who are

780
00:32:12,309 --> 00:32:18,549
inside oh I don't know maybe looking for

781
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:20,260
somebody who's hurt or fallen yeah

782
00:32:18,549 --> 00:32:22,600
you're gonna get caught between those

783
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:24,879
two streams and a lot of damage can be

784
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:27,820
done both to the structure and to

785
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:30,429
yourselves so that's what I mean here by

786
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:32,678
crossing the streams there's also a

787
00:32:30,429 --> 00:32:35,559
problem in firefighting where you see

788
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:38,020
often firefighters take out doors that

789
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:39,970
nose right that's part of ventilation

790
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:42,549
and it's a very very important part of

791
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:44,590
our job but it's also very important to

792
00:32:42,549 --> 00:32:47,350
organize that and coordinate it with

793
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:49,899
other people on the scene because if you

794
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:52,178
don't a number of things can happen one

795
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:54,549
you might be taking out a door or a

796
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:56,440
window and causing a rush of oxygen to

797
00:32:54,549 --> 00:32:59,200
going to the space and causing

798
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:00,580
more fire if you take out a window in

799
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,530
the back of the house where there's no

800
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:05,860
flame and there's flame in the front of

801
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:08,110
that house fire loves oxygen guess where

802
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:10,540
it's going it's going right to that rear

803
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:14,320
window that's a problem we don't want to

804
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:16,810
feed that fire in the wrong way we do

805
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,399
want to get things open so if you have

806
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:19,870
somebody who's freelancing and doing

807
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,510
whatever they want they can cause more

808
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:25,000
harm than good we can see that in an

809
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:27,730
incident response right somebody who's

810
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,470
maybe collecting everything they don't

811
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:32,530
they don't talk to anybody they don't

812
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:34,330
ask what's needed so you get to people

813
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:37,180
who've done collection on the same

814
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:40,899
entity same machine maybe and now you've

815
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:42,580
wasted time or maybe not collecting

816
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:45,640
what's important and so that stuff

817
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:47,770
completely gets forgotten we mentioned I

818
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:50,800
just mentioned the the duplication of

819
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:54,430
data collection and what happens if you

820
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:57,240
screw up and you you know change

821
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:59,920
something because you haven't asked

822
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:01,540
maybe there's a situation where you need

823
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:03,610
to make an alteration and it needs to be

824
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:05,170
documented but nobody's doing that

825
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:06,909
documentation so there's a lot of

826
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:11,080
freelancing that can go on in IR that

827
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:13,000
can cause huge headaches so here are

828
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:15,060
some opportunities here are some good

829
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:19,030
things I learned from firefighting right

830
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:20,739
patients it's so easy to go running in

831
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:22,960
when the bad thing is happening to try

832
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:25,209
to fix the thing because that's what

833
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:28,480
we're good at right we're good at fixing

834
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:30,490
the thing firefighters so good at fixing

835
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,440
the thing too we're good at running in

836
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:36,250
and saving lives and putting wet stuff

837
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:40,179
on the red stuff what we need to take a

838
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:42,969
beat slow is fast as one of my fire

839
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:45,100
instructor says what you do needs to be

840
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:47,409
deliberate consider the best course of

841
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:51,449
action and consider the impact that that

842
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:56,170
action will have so back to that fire

843
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:58,810
look at the picture on the Left picture

844
00:34:56,170 --> 00:35:00,970
on the left was essentially what we saw

845
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:02,650
when we pulled up it was what I was

846
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:05,589
looking at through that thermal camera

847
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:08,560
you'll notice there's flame a little

848
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:10,070
tiny bit coming out in that sort of back

849
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,380
right hand under the

850
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:15,920
and you can see a little in the front

851
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:19,070
and you see a lot of smoke so we know we

852
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,930
have a very hot fire but we don't see a

853
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:23,450
lot of flames shooting out and with that

854
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:26,180
thermal camera I could see that the bulk

855
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:30,129
of the heat and the flame were in the

856
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:33,350
upstairs that's where all of that was

857
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:36,860
unfortunately we weren't so good at

858
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:39,080
opening up where that heat was and so as

859
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:42,080
a result you see the picture on the

860
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:44,540
right instead of getting up into the

861
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:47,180
eaves and opening it up and getting

862
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:51,320
water onto the spot where it was really

863
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:54,740
hot it burned through so the focus was

864
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:56,510
distracted and that's not ideal right we

865
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:58,459
want to take a beat they were they were

866
00:35:56,510 --> 00:36:01,850
focused on getting in and just putting

867
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:05,720
the flame out not focusing on where that

868
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:07,640
potential hotspot really was so instead

869
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:09,049
of you know so they went in that front

870
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:11,990
door if you can kind of see the guy

871
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:14,630
behind the tree instead of getting right

872
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:18,560
up underneath the eaves until there was

873
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:20,390
already a hole out of fire we see these

874
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:24,350
kinds of things an incident response as

875
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:27,500
well I bring up incident response to

876
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:29,540
something called Cheng so Cheng is a

877
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:31,520
company that does a lot of things and

878
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:34,100
one of the things that it does is that

879
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:37,790
it loans it rents textbooks out to

880
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:40,880
students they had a significant breach

881
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:43,880
it's like something like 14 million

882
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:46,510
accounts were compromised so when

883
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:49,690
somebody comes to you and says

884
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:50,470
uh-oh oMG WTF PD hue it's the end of the

885
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:55,180
world right

886
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:59,799
take that beat is it an incident and is

887
00:36:55,180 --> 00:37:01,660
it your incident think about this so in

888
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:04,300
the case of Chag I bring this up because

889
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:07,359
this impacted a large number of

890
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:10,480
educational institutions but it impacted

891
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:13,360
them too indirectly and it impacted them

892
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:18,880
because people love to reuse passwords

893
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:21,580
right so if a compromised account had

894
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:24,280
the same password as that of the

895
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:28,299
university is that the university's

896
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:30,730
breach no it's the check breach with

897
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:32,490
password reuse and yes you have to deal

898
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:35,500
with those accounts that are compromised

899
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:38,410
but you don't necessarily follow the

900
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:41,560
same procedure as if you yourselves were

901
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:45,040
compromised so take a beat before you

902
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:48,130
panic again time is important but life

903
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:50,440
safety a little more important so don't

904
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:52,200
go run it into that server room just

905
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:54,280
because you think there's a problem

906
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:56,080
especially if there's a situation there

907
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:58,540
could be fires or flooding or any other

908
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:00,790
kind of you know incident where you

909
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:03,850
could get hurt and consider what that

910
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:06,930
real risk and implication are of of your

911
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:10,210
actions and what you're going to do

912
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:12,370
accountability now accountability is

913
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:14,500
knowing where everybody is and this

914
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:15,790
seems pretty straightforward you want to

915
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,470
make sure you know where your folks are

916
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:19,509
you don't want them running tripping on

917
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:21,250
things you want duplication of effort

918
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:24,610
any sort of interference stepping on

919
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:25,960
toes literal or figurative because those

920
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:29,560
are things that are going to get in the

921
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:31,900
way of a critical incident so in the

922
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:34,090
fire service on the left you can see

923
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:36,490
what are called accountability tags we

924
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:39,040
have these tags this is how we keep

925
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:42,580
track of who is where we keep two of

926
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:44,200
these on ourselves one lives typically

927
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:46,930
on a helmet and the other somewhere else

928
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:48,430
in our gear and the idea is that when

929
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:51,339
you get on the truck you put one of

930
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:52,930
these on that truck everybody knows who

931
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:55,180
came in that truck so we all know where

932
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:57,520
somebody is so if something goes wrong

933
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:59,560
and we need to find out okay where is

934
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,890
everybody who came on this truck we know

935
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,170
exactly

936
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:03,848
who those people are if you are going

937
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:06,250
into a structure like the fire that I

938
00:39:03,849 --> 00:39:08,140
showed you we drop another tag with an

939
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:10,779
accountability person at the door

940
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:12,910
somewhere and their job is to check to

941
00:39:10,779 --> 00:39:14,890
see where people are in the building so

942
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:17,230
remember the operations folks I told you

943
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:18,910
about so you could have somebody doing

944
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,720
operations on the first floor and you

945
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:21,730
could have somebody else doing

946
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:23,589
operations on the second floor but

947
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:25,630
operations in general is going to know

948
00:39:23,589 --> 00:39:27,308
that there's a team somewhere and so

949
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:29,890
it's the person's job at the door to

950
00:39:27,309 --> 00:39:31,450
keep track of where those folks are well

951
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:33,730
in an incident response we should be

952
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:35,890
doing the same kinds of things we might

953
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:38,140
get that data through swipe card access

954
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:39,970
right we if if we're in a situation

955
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:41,859
where the only people who can get into a

956
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:44,709
server or enter a particular area are

957
00:39:41,859 --> 00:39:47,558
with a swipe card boom now you have some

958
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:49,240
form of accountability frequently if

959
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:51,250
it's a bigger incident than that and you

960
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:53,319
might have other people coming in you

961
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:56,650
might want some kind of incident access

962
00:39:53,319 --> 00:39:58,420
log like you see on the right so keep

963
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:59,529
that in mind if you have an incident

964
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:01,510
where you need to be documenting

965
00:39:59,529 --> 00:40:03,490
everything that's going on especially if

966
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:04,809
you have external entities you want some

967
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:08,979
sort of accountability

968
00:40:04,809 --> 00:40:11,230
I mentioned pre-planning as part of

969
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:13,779
those stages right you need to know your

970
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:15,970
environment I know that one of the

971
00:40:13,779 --> 00:40:18,250
number-one difficulties in Incident

972
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:20,078
Response frankly is knowing where all

973
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:22,900
your stuff is because if you don't know

974
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,849
where it is and somebody says oh then

975
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:26,950
it's hard to know how many of your

976
00:40:24,849 --> 00:40:30,490
things have been impacted right that's

977
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:33,308
not ideal so we want to do some kind of

978
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:35,439
pre-planning the fire department spend a

979
00:40:33,309 --> 00:40:38,559
lot of time doing this with buildings

980
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:40,450
but you can be doing this with other

981
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:46,539
forms of documentation and Incident

982
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:48,848
Response so on the Left we have form of

983
00:40:46,539 --> 00:40:50,559
pre-planning I'm sure if any of you have

984
00:40:48,849 --> 00:40:53,109
ever stayed in a hotel you've seen

985
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:55,809
something like this it's going to show

986
00:40:53,109 --> 00:40:57,970
you where you are maybe in relation to

987
00:40:55,809 --> 00:40:59,440
the rest of the hotel in your room this

988
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:01,720
one's a little more detailed because it

989
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:04,240
has other firefighting items in it it

990
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:07,509
shows us where a hydrant is it shows its

991
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:10,868
electrical shut offs it shows us perhaps

992
00:41:07,509 --> 00:41:12,780
where other types of connections are and

993
00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:16,530
on the right you see

994
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:19,200
rittany pre-plan that shows us some

995
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:20,940
information about how we can get into a

996
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,430
building there's something called an ox

997
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:24,870
box that has a key to the building and

998
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:26,540
that's how firefighters can get in

999
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:28,560
especially during off-hours

1000
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:30,509
it tells us something about the

1001
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:34,110
construction of the building certain

1002
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:36,990
types of buildings burn a lot faster and

1003
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:40,440
a lot easier than others so it means we

1004
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:42,959
have less time in say a wooden structure

1005
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:44,670
than we do in a concrete structure so

1006
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,980
knowing a lot more about how that

1007
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:49,590
building is built can help us make plans

1008
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:51,180
for how we're going to attack a fire how

1009
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:53,580
about access if we need to get somebody

1010
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:55,529
out or we need to get us in how do we

1011
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:58,680
get in how do we get out again all of

1012
00:41:55,530 --> 00:42:01,620
those things go into pre-planning for

1013
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:05,190
incident response I love bringing this

1014
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:07,470
up John strand and his team at Black

1015
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:09,810
Hills has come up with this fabulous

1016
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:11,910
card game called back doors and breaches

1017
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:13,650
and if you're not familiar with it you

1018
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:15,839
should be take a minute

1019
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:18,540
go to their website and you can read all

1020
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:21,330
about it it's this phenomenal card game

1021
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:24,509
that allows you to do some tabletop

1022
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:26,670
exercises it allows you to come up with

1023
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:29,340
a scenario whoever is running the game

1024
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:31,470
will come up with scenario and then you

1025
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:33,450
respond to it so the scenario is some

1026
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:36,660
sort of incident maybe ransomware is hit

1027
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:39,390
and it literally helps you walk through

1028
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:41,339
that scenario so pre-planning in your

1029
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:44,520
environment is going to involve things

1030
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:45,630
like these tabletop exercises who are

1031
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,730
you gonna call when certain things

1032
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:50,300
happen what kind of tools do you have

1033
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:54,240
what can your tools show you

1034
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:55,710
documentation about where data is you

1035
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,390
know do you know where the keys to your

1036
00:42:55,710 --> 00:43:00,690
kingdom are and I don't just mean

1037
00:42:57,390 --> 00:43:03,420
accounts consider the fact that the most

1038
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:05,730
valuable data in your organization may

1039
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:08,100
not be where somebody else thinks it is

1040
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:10,890
so you better know where it is

1041
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:13,799
and ideally you want some sort of

1042
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:16,650
incident response plan and a sense of

1043
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:18,450
who is going to handle that plan so this

1044
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:19,830
is pre-planning right this is the exact

1045
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:22,850
same thing we do in the fire service

1046
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:25,350
it's really valuable if you plan ahead

1047
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:26,080
then you will have a much easier time

1048
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:28,000
when

1049
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:32,770
thing bad does happen and of course we

1050
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:36,430
all know it's bound to happen so let me

1051
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:38,560
sum up a little here ideally an innocent

1052
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:41,140
response we need to start thinking more

1053
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:44,049
like firefighters we need to avoid that

1054
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:45,850
tunnel vision so do a 360 of the problem

1055
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:46,510
take a big step back look at the big

1056
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:49,569
picture

1057
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:51,580
what are those real risks we want to act

1058
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:54,430
we want to act deliberately we want it

1059
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:56,950
don't want to just react and being led

1060
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:59,560
by emotion and just doing right

1061
00:43:56,950 --> 00:44:01,689
don't freelance whatever plan your

1062
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:04,860
organization has in place that's really

1063
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:07,930
what you want to be following have

1064
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:11,200
patience as hard as it is because let me

1065
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:13,750
tell you something even in a fire and

1066
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:16,980
that was the point of showing you those

1067
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:21,700
two images of the house that was on fire

1068
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:23,890
if the folks at that fire who were in

1069
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:26,919
charge had taken a beat and thought

1070
00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:30,009
through for that 60 seconds before they

1071
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:32,890
send people in they might have had a

1072
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:34,780
much better save on that property same

1073
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:36,400
thing goes for Incident Response even

1074
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:39,420
when it seems like it's the end of the

1075
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:42,250
world taking that beat is critical

1076
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:45,430
location is key know where your people

1077
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:48,070
are know where your stuff is documented

1078
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:50,649
and three plans as I said they're

1079
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:52,420
amazing way less chaos if you're

1080
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:54,490
following some sort of a pre plan and

1081
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:58,420
it's gonna be so much safer in so many

1082
00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:59,919
ways and as I mentioned earlier consider

1083
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:02,290
something like the incident command

1084
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:05,140
system you can google that there's tons

1085
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:06,880
of information about that out there it's

1086
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:09,339
not something we tend to think a whole

1087
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,720
lot about unless of course you come from

1088
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:13,390
the military which uses something

1089
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:16,060
similar but have your response organized

1090
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:20,170
have it thought through who's going to

1091
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:23,710
do what when the time comes so some

1092
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:26,800
final thoughts about this I would like

1093
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:31,060
to say that great things never come from

1094
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:32,650
comfort zones right so I know that there

1095
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:35,590
are probably some of you out there who

1096
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:37,030
have done EMS and and firefighting and

1097
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:38,740
have probably been on the side of the

1098
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:39,180
world and there's probably a good many

1099
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:42,479
of you

1100
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:46,200
have it so stretch your wings a little

1101
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:48,839
try some new things think about things

1102
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:50,460
in different ways I think that thinking

1103
00:45:48,839 --> 00:45:52,799
about incident response in terms of

1104
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:56,369
firefighting has given me a whole new

1105
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:58,650
perspective that has you know really

1106
00:45:56,369 --> 00:46:00,660
just opened my eyes to doing things a

1107
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:02,760
better way and I think that's not the

1108
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:05,819
only way we can make these parallels I

1109
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:09,089
think Alyssa's parallels earlier for

1110
00:46:05,819 --> 00:46:12,420
getting things right in terms of smoking

1111
00:46:09,089 --> 00:46:15,990
a brisket are easily the same kind of

1112
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:18,630
things right so with that I will I would

1113
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:21,569
thank you so much for coming to hear me

1114
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:25,069
speak and I hope you guys have a great

1115
00:46:21,569 --> 00:46:25,069
rest of your Circle City Khan

1116
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:32,930
you
