1
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:11,540
last

2
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:13,910
deaqon hopefully you know the virtual

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:15,889
environment has been as productive for

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:19,640
you as it was for me I I've actually

5
00:00:15,889 --> 00:00:21,860
been more attached to discord than I

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:25,130
have for a long time

7
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:27,800
but so yeah so uh my name is Lin tile I

8
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:31,220
will own it in public for those of you

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:34,690
I've been sort of facilitating the the

10
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:39,010
slow driving of crazy over the weekend

11
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:41,930
with me on audio here is the Mike Connor

12
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:44,180
Mike has put together a lot of the

13
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:47,120
challenges that that you play throughout

14
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,710
the weekend so you know I'm at least the

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,989
the one that you can you know see the

16
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:55,339
face if you see me in public but Mike

17
00:00:50,989 --> 00:00:59,030
you want to say hi well that's good

18
00:00:55,339 --> 00:01:00,739
enough nurses always Mike but so the

19
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:04,670
purpose of this talk just to let

20
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:07,759
everybody know kind of what I wanted to

21
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:10,340
do is I want to just run you through

22
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,760
sort of some of the motivations some of

23
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:16,160
the things behind the scenes and you

24
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,360
know really give this as a time for the

25
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,800
people that play in the seats you have

26
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,620
to get a little bit of resolution on

27
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,850
anything we're going to talk about how

28
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,920
we're gonna handle things about

29
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:28,039
write-ups where Mike Mike and I are

30
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:31,310
actually going to run a program about

31
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:33,140
how to basically solicit write-ups about

32
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:34,880
the individual challenges maybe even

33
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,680
give that surprises for a good write-ups

34
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,839
but in the vein of trying to help

35
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,360
disseminate information about the way

36
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,540
that we do some of these things so

37
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,000
please I'm watching the track one

38
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:49,190
channel a discord for questions as we go

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,229
along feel free to interrupt me I want

40
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:54,229
this to be you know not me just talking

41
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:55,850
to you you know like a lecture style

42
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:57,170
like an actual talk I'd love to be more

43
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:00,229
of a discussion so I'll be watching

44
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:01,880
there okay well let's start with

45
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:04,010
addressing sort of the elephant in the

46
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,979
room which is this didn't look like a

47
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:09,739
normal CTF one of the things I will say

48
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:12,920
that I always try to do with the contest

49
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:18,260
at Circle City con is explore concepts

50
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:20,269
in these contests that I really frankly

51
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:22,670
I kind of use y'all is a little bit of

52
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:25,700
an experiment I contribute to Allah

53
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:29,809
of these challenges for those of you who

54
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:31,369
was your first CTF this probably it

55
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:33,440
might have ruined you in terms of what

56
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:36,980
to expect so let me highlight some of

57
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:39,859
the differences that that we see so

58
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:41,030
again this year we did the score

59
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,700
boarding a little bit differently in

60
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:47,060
years past I've used a web scoreboard

61
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:49,700
you know that's this cloud hosted for me

62
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:52,040
it was interesting to sort of build a

63
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,290
discord bot from scratch so that's what

64
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:57,260
I did

65
00:02:53,290 --> 00:03:00,200
technical information on that I wrote it

66
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:04,160
in Python using the discord py interface

67
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:05,780
to to discord for those of you who want

68
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,269
to know exactly how that works what that

69
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:12,489
is is essentially a WebSocket which

70
00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:15,530
interacts with this cords back-end that

71
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:17,870
basically allows the bots to see

72
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:19,730
essentially all of the messages all of

73
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:22,130
the users all of the things that happen

74
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:25,518
on discord channel or on a discord

75
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:28,340
server I should say what we use that for

76
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,049
is basically two things the the

77
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:33,109
structure as you pretty much see is that

78
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:36,500
the challenges are the individual

79
00:03:33,109 --> 00:03:38,840
channels in categories a side note about

80
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:42,380
that that kind of lesson learned it

81
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:45,470
actually is really good for not having

82
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:47,269
to spam notifications to cetf guests

83
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:50,600
because you can see which channels are

84
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:52,670
unread which channels which what

85
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,290
channels have been updated so you know

86
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:56,780
we kind of let discord handle that

87
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:58,578
notification policy so that everybody

88
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:02,269
you could either opt in to notifying and

89
00:03:58,579 --> 00:04:04,340
everything or or not so that's kind of

90
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:07,660
the basic idea there on the back end on

91
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:11,000
our side we I had a Postgres database

92
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:12,530
that I used SQL alchemy so that we can

93
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,600
retarget it later to a different

94
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:16,430
database schema if we need to but

95
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,738
essentially what I'm tracking in the

96
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:21,530
database or the different users the

97
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:25,250
different answers questions hints all of

98
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:27,888
it sort of relationally and so what

99
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:30,200
would happen is you know you invoke a

100
00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:33,140
command with a bot the handler would

101
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:36,440
query the database and basically you

102
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:38,960
know moving on yeah absolutely it's it's

103
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:44,900
it's Ingo Angus had a question how deep

104
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:46,729
into the socket did I go basically the

105
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:50,179
answer to that is I could have gone

106
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:52,250
deeper there are opportunities to get a

107
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:54,860
lot more sort of metadata level

108
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:57,370
information for this first iteration I

109
00:04:54,860 --> 00:05:02,450
only use sort of the canned message

110
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:04,970
responses that that were sort of

111
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:07,370
happening normally through the the

112
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:09,560
discord dot py interface they've got a

113
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:11,660
good relational object model that you

114
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:14,240
can sort of move between concepts pretty

115
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:16,400
easily so I didn't add anything to that

116
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,830
there are a couple of places where I

117
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,349
think you could definitely improve the

118
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:23,650
way that I coded it by doing a little

119
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:26,810
bit more but again lessons learned

120
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:29,780
throughout this for me meant that sort

121
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:32,390
of just trying to capture messages in

122
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:34,640
terms of the strategy of how we wanted

123
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:36,860
to limit interaction you know and I'm

124
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,050
not saying about this set of CTF

125
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,669
contestants but I'm saying if in general

126
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,930
if you're going to use this bot in the

127
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:44,270
larger competition I think it's

128
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:46,820
important to be able to control of the

129
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:50,299
public forums in terms of moderation on

130
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:52,669
the actual scoreboard server so that you

131
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:55,190
know there's fewer places that people

132
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:59,359
actually can put flags and stuff that

133
00:05:55,190 --> 00:06:02,540
might give away things but I will tell

134
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:05,180
you that we did so that's why we did the

135
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:08,000
moderation so that the first thing you

136
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:09,950
saw when you logged into the server was

137
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,960
that one open channel that you couldn't

138
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:15,500
you know post into but it would allow

139
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:18,320
you to sort of activate the rules on the

140
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,480
server with the bots I had a bunch of -

141
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:24,169
dues that I didn't get you know - done

142
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,600
about doing more sophisticated role

143
00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:28,099
management and things like that

144
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,540
again there's no technical blockers to

145
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,820
all of that you can automate all of

146
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:33,740
those things to the discord interface it

147
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,360
was just you know this was the first

148
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:38,000
iteration and I wanted to make sure that

149
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:41,510
the parts like flag submission and the

150
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:46,729
like were you know we're as solid and

151
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:49,010
secure as possible yeah okay so in terms

152
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:50,190
of the other pieces of this flag

153
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,690
submission you know

154
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:53,730
you have all of the you know from

155
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:56,910
running a CTF style you have all of the

156
00:06:53,730 --> 00:07:01,200
different sort of traditional validators

157
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:02,880
for flags both red X as well as exact I

158
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,849
know we had a couple of issues on that

159
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,830
side which we corrected I will say based

160
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:09,630
upon correcting issues sometimes that

161
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:14,580
can be a difficult process if you played

162
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:17,550
a lot of CTF the the thing that is nice

163
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:19,859
about the disc court interface is since

164
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:21,600
for example one of the things that I

165
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:24,900
want you to know about how I tracked

166
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:27,420
users if you put your discord into

167
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:30,479
developer mode you can actually right

168
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:32,850
click on pretty much anything in the

169
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:36,870
discord client and and do an operation

170
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:40,080
called copy ID what that ID is called a

171
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:43,710
snowflake and in this case a snowflake

172
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:46,560
is a time-stamped unique identifier for

173
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:48,810
literally nted every entity in discord

174
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,060
so the cool part about that was that

175
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:54,270
when I had you jump from the circle city

176
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:57,180
discord click the you know use that link

177
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:58,979
or click that link the your identity on

178
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:02,520
the circle city discord is going to be

179
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:05,820
directly correlated with mine based upon

180
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:08,400
your username and your a hashtag number

181
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:10,469
which they call a differentiator I use

182
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,080
that that snowflake to track the

183
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:16,080
different users so that I knew how to go

184
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:18,570
to anybody in the circle city discord

185
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,430
versus you know people in the CTF that's

186
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:21,599
been a problem in the past sometimes you

187
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:24,270
want to make sure that the people you

188
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:26,040
give prizes to as part of your seats yet

189
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:29,159
if you've opened it up are actually

190
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:32,010
attendees of your con having won sort of

191
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,960
format for you know for tracking those

192
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:36,240
users against what had been loaded in

193
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,550
the discord ended up saving a lot of

194
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,169
work on the backend and it allows you to

195
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:42,659
sort of definitively track people

196
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:46,079
frankly another big benefit is just not

197
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:48,510
having to implement user registration

198
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:54,320
yourself you know in the in the vein of

199
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:54,319
you know multi-factor author uh

200
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:58,710
you know dis courts interface there for

201
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:01,430
user management and that that's one of

202
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:03,560
the things that work particularly well

203
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:05,870
yeah and pretty much

204
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:09,649
the other the only other piece hosting

205
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:11,930
wise that I use so all of the components

206
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:14,509
the bots and a couple of the challenges

207
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:17,628
that required some more back-end stuff

208
00:09:14,509 --> 00:09:19,790
we're hosted via AWS one of the things

209
00:09:17,629 --> 00:09:21,769
that you know I'd love to talk about is

210
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:24,349
how much that generally costs my

211
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:26,930
forecasted glass all told for all of the

212
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:30,920
AWS services that I used is it going to

213
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:33,489
be about $35 for about the last month so

214
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:39,110
it's very accessible in terms of budget

215
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:40,850
the other piece of that is I used a CBN

216
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:43,370
that I wanted to test that I used fast

217
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:46,779
that IO so the links that you actually

218
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:50,750
saw next to the challenges was you know

219
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:54,100
CDN that I used to you know sort of

220
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:59,060
securely manage and propagate files I

221
00:09:54,100 --> 00:10:00,980
didn't hear any reports of anybody that

222
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:03,290
had any problems with the download and

223
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:05,509
in fact you know one of the things I

224
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:07,459
wanted to do was make sure that if we

225
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:09,230
did use this in other context where

226
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:12,018
there'd be larger file download seems

227
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:15,319
like peak apps or other virtual machines

228
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:19,610
that this could handle this all told for

229
00:10:15,319 --> 00:10:23,029
a month that that cbn cost me $12 so I

230
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:25,420
think that is not too bad in terms of

231
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:28,970
the scale of what we put together here

232
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:30,860
ok I'm gonna pause on sort of my ramble

233
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:33,350
about infrastructure to see if anybody

234
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:35,420
has any questions not about the actual

235
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:37,610
content but about the infrastructure

236
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:47,420
themselves I'll wait a couple minutes if

237
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:49,639
anybody's typing ya rotten rat we used

238
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:54,229
to actually host a lot of our own

239
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:57,680
virtual private servers and and

240
00:10:54,230 --> 00:11:00,589
basically what we found is that the

241
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:03,349
benefit as unless you're doing something

242
00:11:00,589 --> 00:11:05,809
really sophisticated where you have to

243
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:09,620
have full control over the network like

244
00:11:05,809 --> 00:11:11,630
90% of CTF challenges in a jeopardy

245
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:14,360
style CTF don't require that level of

246
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:16,660
introspection and so it's cheaper it's

247
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:19,029
more reliable it's easier to recover

248
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:21,130
if you actually host most of it neh WS

249
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:22,899
and and frankly we've been pretty

250
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:25,329
successfully doing that for a few years

251
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:27,279
uh it would be amenable to any cloud

252
00:11:25,329 --> 00:11:32,079
style I just happen to use the AWS

253
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:35,680
because it's the easier one okay

254
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:41,258
seeing no more typing or questions I'll

255
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:42,969
give Sam and Ian one more second to

256
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:46,300
finish their if they're right in a

257
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:49,029
question and then I'll move on okay cool

258
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:52,870
seeing everybody stop questioning so

259
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:55,930
let's let's move into sort of where you

260
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:58,930
know we defer diverge from a traditional

261
00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:02,709
CTF and you know I'll give Mike a chance

262
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:06,370
to talk about any of his challenges that

263
00:12:02,709 --> 00:12:08,800
he really liked but you know so one of

264
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:11,500
the things that I enjoy doing as part of

265
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:15,699
the CTF is maybe focusing a little bit

266
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:18,850
less on the actual sort of standard

267
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:21,310
tools and pieces that you know sort of

268
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:24,970
as rinse and repeat in terms of CTFs and

269
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:26,920
I try to craft challenges which you know

270
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:29,439
require you to use certain computing

271
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,670
tools but if you use them without

272
00:12:29,439 --> 00:12:32,500
actually thinking about your

273
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:40,500
surroundings it's it's a little bit

274
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:42,399
harder the you know sometimes I

275
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,319
sometimes we missed the mark here

276
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,630
because you know a lot of things leads

277
00:12:44,319 --> 00:12:50,649
you are experimental but the idea here

278
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:53,290
is to really sort of put critical

279
00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:55,420
thinking style clues in the actual

280
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:59,349
prompts as well as hidden in the files

281
00:12:55,420 --> 00:13:01,599
that are unexpected really we you know

282
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:03,220
this is maybe more of a puzzle CTF than

283
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,519
what you would get at a lot of other

284
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:09,250
kinds like as a as a you know contrast

285
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:11,620
to the security innovations command and

286
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:14,829
control that was more of a you know

287
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:18,790
actual look at the cyber range sort of

288
00:13:14,829 --> 00:13:21,219
you know figure out the devices figure

289
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:23,980
out all of the different boxes and try

290
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:25,779
to exploit them we're more on the here's

291
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:27,880
an unexpected input that might be the

292
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:30,270
result of one of the artifacts you might

293
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:32,400
find on one of those things

294
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:34,560
and in fact a lot of the techniques that

295
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:38,010
we use are things that we found you know

296
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,719
in samples that we've dealt with you

297
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:43,370
know throughout time and so you know

298
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:47,730
from for those of you who this was your

299
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:49,980
first CTF know that you know in the

300
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:53,100
future you're most likely going to cease

301
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:55,410
ETFs that have more you know more

302
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,960
challenges that have less personality I

303
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:59,730
guess would be the way that I put it it

304
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:02,070
tends to focus a little bit more on the

305
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:05,820
actual mechanics of exploitation or

306
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:07,860
discovery or forensics whereas I think

307
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:12,750
we were a little bit more pithy with the

308
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:15,780
puzzles that we put together right so

309
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:17,370
okay so we definitely had a couple of

310
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:20,310
challenges that we're gonna want to walk

311
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:22,380
through Mike do you want to talk about

312
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:24,239
any specific challenges that you know

313
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:27,380
that we're solved that you know it's

314
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,380
maybe prompt any questions

315
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:32,070
none that really ships forward is this

316
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:34,740
is the one that I want to walk through

317
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:38,220
where they're earning from the chat that

318
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:41,310
they wanted some thoughts or feedback on

319
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:42,750
why we chose what we did gee you've been

320
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:47,219
watching the chat did you see any that

321
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:48,870
we should go through oh the emoji code

322
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:55,950
one Mike do you want to talk about that

323
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:57,990
I suppose I can okay yeah so we're not

324
00:14:55,950 --> 00:15:00,420
going to talk about all of the details

325
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:02,280
because like I said at the beginning of

326
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,750
the talk the last thing that we're going

327
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,939
to talk about is what we're going to do

328
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:08,010
in terms of the write-ups but you know I

329
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:10,170
think in general Mike you can you know

330
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:12,930
give people a little bit of feedback of

331
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:17,250
what you know the actual the answer was

332
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:19,380
or what the what the format was okay so

333
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:21,600
with this one it's a the big issue that

334
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:24,090
a lot of people ran into was the copy

335
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,680
and paste directly out of discord has it

336
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:28,200
changed to the shorthand code for each

337
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,540
of them that was certainly not intended

338
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,070
for the challenge at all but guess what

339
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:34,439
that made an extra step to the challenge

340
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:37,470
you can deal with it we did we did raise

341
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:40,740
the points on the back end for that when

342
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:42,780
that happened quite substantially but

343
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,620
it's one of those where the code itself

344
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:46,290
was yet

345
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:49,560
- emojis so a lot of people had came

346
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:51,000
into this finding entirely what we were

347
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,459
looking for and we found this during

348
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,760
testing as well if I think it was code

349
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:58,290
mochi by Mozilla that wasn't what we

350
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:01,140
were intended for there was a different

351
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:03,360
tool that we use to create that which I

352
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:05,150
think that itself is enough that you

353
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,500
might be able to start giving in to

354
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:10,319
where for me it was literally just a

355
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:13,290
command-line tool of pipe the flag

356
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:16,290
through it and that's what you get okay

357
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:17,760
so it's a one step process I know a few

358
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,360
people are likely still digging into

359
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,830
that one

360
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,740
so I don't want to give away exactly

361
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:24,390
everything but we intentionally used a

362
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:26,250
tool that wasn't the very first thing

363
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:27,750
that showed up yeah you might have to

364
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:30,410
dig through a little bit to figure out

365
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:34,050
what that tool is and what we were doing

366
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:35,939
great yeah

367
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:37,770
tinker I take your ferry I said it's

368
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,779
something that I want to respond to as

369
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:43,290
feel free to totally solve the

370
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:45,990
unsolvable or spoil the unsolved ones no

371
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:49,740
a lot of the ones that we have put

372
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:51,959
together we will like like Mike like

373
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:55,890
Mike Maya has said ever since we did the

374
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:57,900
CTF last year the an address puzzle was

375
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:59,310
again the exact same puzzle from last

376
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:01,110
year and we only had a couple of people

377
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:05,159
do it but that puzzles been sort of

378
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:08,849
publicly available since last year so

379
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:10,589
you know I would say that one of the

380
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:15,869
decisions that we've made about the

381
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:18,419
server the the server that we're doing

382
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:21,239
for the next couple of weeks I'm going

383
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:26,160
to leave the bought up in in the mode

384
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:28,109
that you see now that will accept Soto

385
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,970
validate flags for correctness or

386
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:32,760
incorrectness but it will not change any

387
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:36,240
points or will not record anything

388
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:38,250
shout out to in for a couple of years

389
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,010
ago that found a bug in one of the other

390
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:44,010
scoring systems I had that test case and

391
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:47,460
I matrix and I made sure that the ending

392
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:50,429
behavior did not change or corrupt the

393
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:54,270
scoreboard at all if people do submit

394
00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:56,559
flags at the end so congratulations for

395
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:59,710
for affecting my my

396
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:02,320
my my business going forward there we

397
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:05,350
did make sure that that that was taken

398
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,809
care of so for all of you that are

399
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:09,639
waiting for sort of looking at the asset

400
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:13,418
ones yeah like she mentioned she is

401
00:18:09,639 --> 00:18:17,939
going to go through all of the all of

402
00:18:13,419 --> 00:18:20,499
the assent ones in more more detail

403
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:23,320
thinking stone den was zips egg

404
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:27,850
steganography Mike do you wanna you want

405
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:30,480
to respond about stone den yeah I can

406
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:33,070
pretty much explain that one yeah hole

407
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,200
so is its kind of been commented in the

408
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:37,809
CTF support yet we were playing around

409
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,399
with polyglot files which for those of

410
00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:41,830
you that aren't aware that is a file

411
00:18:39,399 --> 00:18:44,529
with one extension that also is the

412
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:46,629
exact same file via another extension so

413
00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:48,820
yes the way that that challenge was

414
00:18:46,629 --> 00:18:50,918
prompted was to ask people to extract

415
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:53,110
all the files where the flag was hidden

416
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:56,649
in the file itself not the files that

417
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:58,600
you extracted so the way that that one

418
00:18:56,649 --> 00:19:00,610
was solved was determining what file it

419
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:05,709
should be and changing the extension

420
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:09,070
okay so so yeah sorry so so in terms of

421
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:11,590
why this might be relevant to you as a

422
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:14,080
either a hacker an analyst or an InfoSec

423
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:16,029
partitioner practitioner partitioner

424
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,379
whatever if you're a practitioner I

425
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:18,610
guess you're a partitioner that if

426
00:19:17,379 --> 00:19:22,090
you're doing it right so that makes

427
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:24,279
sense but the idea is a one that you

428
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:27,220
know polyglot files are one of the ways

429
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:31,059
that attackers can get an unexpected

430
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:32,950
input file into an environment which is

431
00:19:31,059 --> 00:19:35,678
trying to check the type of a file based

432
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:38,710
upon its extension a lot of you know

433
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,330
really simple naive security controls

434
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:42,460
only look at what's after the dot they

435
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:45,158
don't actually introspect the the

436
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:47,230
content of those files to figure out

437
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:52,419
what they are and so if I'm as a hacker

438
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:54,509
I'm trying to you know stage my code you

439
00:19:52,419 --> 00:19:57,159
know somewhere else what I would do is

440
00:19:54,509 --> 00:19:59,200
masquerade the actual payload as another

441
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:00,549
type of file and then upload it or or

442
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,029
try to get it on the machine but I'm

443
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:09,309
trying to get target access to and so

444
00:20:03,029 --> 00:20:10,330
like rotten rat absolutely like rotten

445
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:12,580
rat absolutely

446
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:16,480
right about a good a good thing to do in

447
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:18,970
a CTF is always use the file command the

448
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,269
file command is something that is

449
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:24,580
standard on a lot of Linux distributions

450
00:20:21,269 --> 00:20:27,610
it's built on a piece of code called Lib

451
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:29,199
magic which is super exciting to look at

452
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:32,709
the source code of it's an open source

453
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:35,649
library that gives patterns based upon

454
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:39,240
the actual byte contents of files so

455
00:20:35,649 --> 00:20:42,219
that as it scans through those files

456
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:44,110
what what it actually does is it matches

457
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:47,169
them if you're familiar with something

458
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:49,779
like yara it's a similar idea it's kind

459
00:20:47,169 --> 00:20:51,639
of like yara for files but it's always a

460
00:20:49,779 --> 00:20:54,549
good way to make sure that what you're

461
00:20:51,639 --> 00:20:57,760
looking at is what it's at and then also

462
00:20:54,549 --> 00:21:00,090
strings is one way to look inside a file

463
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:03,940
to see all the ASCII printable strings

464
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:06,100
but the other the other piece here are

465
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:08,320
that might be a tool that you know as

466
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:11,439
you go forward might be useful to look

467
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:14,080
at is something called bin walk bin walk

468
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,480
is an interesting program that is you

469
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:19,779
that you also use this live magic that

470
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:23,080
will actually roll through the contents

471
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:24,940
of a binary file and find all of the sub

472
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:27,250
components or the sub sections of that

473
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:29,769
that are also files so anything like

474
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:31,990
file nesting where you know you've got a

475
00:21:29,769 --> 00:21:35,529
picture stuck inside of another type of

476
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:38,529
file or embedding you know I would

477
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:40,870
suggest try it on like a JPEG format

478
00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:43,840
image you'll see a number of different

479
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:46,840
pieces of that image which bin walk

480
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,610
identifies and can help you investigate

481
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,439
in a separate way

482
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:54,279
but like rotten net pointed out all of

483
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:57,820
those are our great are our great ideas

484
00:21:54,279 --> 00:22:01,059
but good question Mike do you want to

485
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:04,059
say anything more about that so then I

486
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:07,269
know they're unintended but quite

487
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:09,399
hilarious consequence was that for this

488
00:22:07,269 --> 00:22:11,440
challenge we didn't actually use the

489
00:22:09,399 --> 00:22:13,178
flag format so that you couldn't use

490
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,210
strings or you couldn't just search for

491
00:22:13,179 --> 00:22:18,850
a specific format to find the flag we

492
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:20,380
actually had to read the document to get

493
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:22,899
the flag and then because of how long

494
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:24,110
the flag was a lot of people were

495
00:22:22,899 --> 00:22:26,449
unintentionally

496
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:27,830
adding carriage returns to their flags

497
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:31,100
and missions that we got a good laugh

498
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:32,480
out of on our end because of the

499
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:36,889
document that they were pulling stuff

500
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:38,059
out of right yeah and actually sorry I

501
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:40,850
know this is a little bit of a throwback

502
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:42,379
to the infrastructure piece but just

503
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:44,510
just to let you all know very

504
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:49,100
transparently the bug that I had to fix

505
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:51,230
in the bot so if you use the help you

506
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:53,360
know if you did get the help message it

507
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:54,710
will for the individual commands sort of

508
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,350
tell you the parameters that it's

509
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:59,450
expecting just to let you all know

510
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:03,590
exactly what was going on if you didn't

511
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:05,870
quote flags that had spaces in them what

512
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:09,139
it was actually doing was every word was

513
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:11,780
a new parameter to the command and in

514
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:14,240
the cases where some of you put the

515
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:18,260
quotes somewhere in the middle of that

516
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:21,020
string what that ended up you know

517
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:22,910
having a problem with was that I was

518
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:24,918
getting an error that I wasn't directly

519
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:27,770
handling in the bot called unbalanced

520
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:30,500
parentheses it's a discord error that

521
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:32,840
are unbalanced unbalanced quotation

522
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:34,520
marks sorry it's a discord error that

523
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,918
would actually prevent the command from

524
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,690
fully executing so I actually didn't get

525
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:40,790
to my own error handler that I had

526
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:42,890
written so this was actually a thing

527
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:44,450
where I had to add an error handler at

528
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:46,610
another level that finally gave you a

529
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:48,650
message but in the code that will

530
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:50,330
finally release we're gonna have a lot

531
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:52,850
more user friendliness around that and

532
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:54,379
in fact you saw that if you if you did

533
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:56,418
make that mistake again when you were

534
00:23:54,380 --> 00:24:00,200
submitting the flag as is more than one

535
00:23:56,419 --> 00:24:02,600
parameter yeah I know I I completely

536
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:05,780
understand that you know that wasn't the

537
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:08,689
best user experience thing and you know

538
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:11,540
we'll have that fixed for the future

539
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:15,590
yeah okay so I think that's probably

540
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:17,178
about it on that challenge well I think

541
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:19,270
you know that one of the things that

542
00:24:17,179 --> 00:24:22,400
everybody here is sort of waiting for is

543
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:28,129
handing it over to gee to sort of walk

544
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:32,870
through the walk through the the OSINT

545
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:37,220
challenges so I'm going to put this on

546
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:37,879
the board and hand it over to G so one

547
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:48,350
moment

548
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:56,030
we switch places if I can computer and

549
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:58,610
then I will put the this right that's my

550
00:24:56,030 --> 00:25:06,850
face sorry this is a real high-tech

551
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:09,919
handoff all right there we go great

552
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:16,240
hey everybody I will love to G I'm not

553
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:16,240
right hello alrighty everything's up

554
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:21,020
sweet I can see questions I will do the

555
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:25,850
same thing I'll try to follow questions

556
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:28,190
online so this is also my first go at

557
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:31,969
writing Oh sent questions I've done Oh

558
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:33,590
some challenges but my first hand at

559
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:35,630
actually writing them so obviously I had

560
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:39,139
a lot of fun I'm married to someone who

561
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:41,600
does challenges like this you've

562
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:44,150
experienced it so obviously I have to do

563
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,340
the same red herrings all over the place

564
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:47,540
but I will walk through them and

565
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:50,389
actually I have pictures and links and

566
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:52,340
you know specifics so we'll post this

567
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:53,780
somewhere else as well that you guys can

568
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:55,850
follow but I tried to actually write

569
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:58,700
through how I did it how I found all the

570
00:25:55,850 --> 00:26:02,240
pieces and hopefully that will help so

571
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:04,460
yeah fancy go link thanks babe no no

572
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,190
there we go alright so the first one was

573
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:09,110
hungry I just posted the clue after

574
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:10,760
searching through cabinets leaves you

575
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:13,219
with more questions you will dine here

576
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:18,050
across the street invite your enemies as

577
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:20,270
you please this was the file and that

578
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:22,280
was attached I think it was the only one

579
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:25,850
that has a file so my first step

580
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:28,600
whenever I get an image in an ocean

581
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:31,550
challenge is to reverse image search

582
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:34,610
where that image is used so that's what

583
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:37,850
I did we find that it's I play doula the

584
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:40,879
revelation of st. John and when you

585
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:43,100
scroll scroll down on Google you can see

586
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:46,510
where this image is used like what pages

587
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:48,820
use it one of those being this link WGA

588
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:50,929
I think I have that on the next slide

589
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:54,740
and that is

590
00:26:50,929 --> 00:26:57,679
the fat little concealer in Kailua it's

591
00:26:54,740 --> 00:27:00,140
a museum in Germany and it actually says

592
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:05,600
that it is in the collection cabinet so

593
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:07,100
in a cabinet for metal or wood carvings

594
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,699
they actually have cabinets just for

595
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:12,709
that so it's not actually on display but

596
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:14,870
it is in a cabinet so you know we have

597
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:17,510
that in the clue cabinet searching

598
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:20,389
through cabinets so when you google

599
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:21,980
search for this quintella you get a map

600
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:23,780
view the answer the prima i'll show you

601
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:26,659
on the slide so when you go to that link

602
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:29,059
you can see that the picture is here the

603
00:27:26,659 --> 00:27:31,820
revelant revelation of Saint John and

604
00:27:29,059 --> 00:27:36,530
you can see that's in a cabinet you can

605
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:38,270
see where it is Oh back quintella and

606
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:40,158
when you google that you can see there's

607
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:45,918
not only one restaurant across the

608
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:47,929
street la prima and see that's the

609
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,130
answer the Prima I believe yep the Prima

610
00:27:47,929 --> 00:27:54,830
is right across the street it's the only

611
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:56,330
one and that's kind of the way that if

612
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:57,590
you're going down I know I saw a bunch

613
00:27:56,330 --> 00:28:01,370
of people saying that they were looking

614
00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:02,959
at ders house or home it has a bunch of

615
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:04,489
cabinets and some of his old stuff but

616
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,900
when you look for restaurants there's

617
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:07,280
like a hundred restaurants around the

618
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,840
area that's when you know you're down a

619
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,908
rabbit hole because you're trying to

620
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:13,250
look for that like one answer that makes

621
00:28:10,909 --> 00:28:14,450
sense so when you look back at this

622
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:17,480
image you can see that there's really

623
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:19,730
just one restaurant around it and it's

624
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:22,460
the premium so that was the answer and I

625
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:29,299
don't think I saw yep exit tools got

626
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:31,039
that so the second one was hunker I

627
00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:34,730
think this is the only one that wasn't

628
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:37,158
solved the answer was cave of the

629
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:38,809
apocalypse so again all of these clues

630
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:42,320
and all of these answers have apocalypse

631
00:28:38,809 --> 00:28:43,990
and it's somehow that is you know the

632
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:48,490
theme and that's what I continued with

633
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:51,289
so the clue was to escape the inevitable

634
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:54,020
4880 nautical miles east from where we

635
00:28:51,289 --> 00:28:58,340
stood this aptly named site will do just

636
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:59,990
fine as a bunker so a couple of both red

637
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:03,709
herrings as well as things that you have

638
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:04,540
to dig through using Google Maps I use

639
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:10,050
Google Maps tears

640
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:13,300
a ton of map tools where you can put in

641
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:15,310
circles and measurements Google Maps

642
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:19,540
works really well I think I might also

643
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:22,090
use oh I have that my computer I used a

644
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:23,920
different app to kind of draw a circle

645
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:25,360
with whichever diameter or radius you

646
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:28,060
need and then it shows you exactly where

647
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,709
that point is so when you start at the

648
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:31,600
westin because that's where we should be

649
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:33,640
standing and should be at this weekend

650
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,830
not which ever address you are at

651
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:38,790
currently because I wouldn't know that

652
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:42,790
so using Westin as the starting point

653
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:44,530
converting 4880 nautical miles to miles

654
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:48,340
which is five thousand six hundred and

655
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:50,820
fifteen you travel east so I think I

656
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:55,379
have a screenshot here so I have Indiana

657
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:58,389
Indianapolis you travel east I kind of

658
00:29:55,380 --> 00:30:00,490
I'm showing kind of a span here but it

659
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:03,850
kind of puts you into this area right

660
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:07,870
here it's Greece Turkey the waters of

661
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:11,800
Greece Turkey if you scroll in it's the

662
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:14,139
Aegean Sea it's the wait where is it

663
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:16,090
the Dodecanese islands that's kind of

664
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:19,120
where it puts you at then there's some

665
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:22,209
searching you've got to do I will I

666
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:25,540
definitely left this as a hint for later

667
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:28,030
which we did add I think yesterday or

668
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:31,060
late last night but if you kind of do a

669
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:33,129
search of Aegean Sea dodecanese islands

670
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:35,409
and ik apocalypse that's the theme you

671
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:38,560
find Patmos the island of Patmos and the

672
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:41,620
Cave of the apocalypse the hint we gave

673
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:45,310
was permute your ideas towards the air

674
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:48,790
worthy allege that is an anagram for the

675
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:50,800
world heritage site the unesco world

676
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:53,200
heritage site and I think I have a

677
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:55,750
screenshot so this is their map at

678
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,670
UNESCO you can see if you're looking at

679
00:30:55,750 --> 00:31:00,850
that same Aegean Sea there's a couple of

680
00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:03,310
sites that they have highlighted so if

681
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:05,850
you kind of compared that map with this

682
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:08,800
map you can kind of see we're in exactly

683
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:11,939
the same area and if you click on it

684
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:14,409
here you can see the historic center of

685
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:19,470
the st. of st. John and the cave of the

686
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:22,450
apocalypse so yeah that is

687
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:23,830
that is the answer I think was cave of

688
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:25,210
the apocalypse and I think that is the

689
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:27,639
only Oh scent that was not solved

690
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:31,150
question there how did you get that plot

691
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:33,400
on the map um I used so I suspect I did

692
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:37,030
Google Maps that definitely gets you

693
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:39,190
into I think if you drew a straight line

694
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:44,320
it gets you right into the kind of top

695
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:47,590
of Turkey it's I think it's right click

696
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:50,080
on Google and you can like measure I

697
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:52,899
know that if you only use four thousand

698
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:55,629
eight hundred and eighty miles it puts

699
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:57,039
you on the other side of Greece so you

700
00:31:55,630 --> 00:32:01,090
need to definitely convert that into

701
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:05,110
miles from nautical miles the this app

702
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:07,330
right here I'll have to check no this is

703
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:09,840
Google Maps as well yeah it shows down

704
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:20,590
here so this is a screenshot from Google

705
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:22,120
yeah sorry I'm just reading yes so it's

706
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:26,340
definitely once you once you measure out

707
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:28,570
that five thousand six hundred and

708
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:31,000
fifteen miles you're definitely getting

709
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:34,000
into that tip of Turkey but that's kind

710
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,770
of straight due east and if you look in

711
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,010
that region right it's that searching

712
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:41,289
that region with apocalypse and then

713
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:44,440
with the hint to UNESCO once you go to

714
00:32:41,289 --> 00:32:48,010
the UNESCO website you know the came of

715
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:49,960
the apocalypse becomes that I think even

716
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:54,970
part of the clue says this aptly named

717
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:56,559
site so came of the apocalypse um that's

718
00:32:54,970 --> 00:33:00,280
how that gets you there

719
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:02,559
that was honker I believe and the next

720
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:04,840
one was locked down so that these other

721
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:08,049
two ones definitely got solved

722
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:11,439
considered the Cinderella of the garden

723
00:33:08,049 --> 00:33:13,379
accompanied by this how many can you

724
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:16,419
find at seventy-eight North fifteen East

725
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:18,330
again a couple of red herrings or things

726
00:33:16,419 --> 00:33:20,140
you can kind of go down a rabbit hole

727
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:23,408
that's the whole point of Oh sense

728
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:26,260
sometimes is so considered to consider a

729
00:33:23,409 --> 00:33:27,970
Cinderella of the garden definitely has

730
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:29,830
a couple of options I think the fifth

731
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:31,810
link when you google it literally says

732
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:37,169
zinnia the Cinderella of

733
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:42,070
garden it's literally the title of the

734
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:43,930
the article and when you search for the

735
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:45,760
Japanese letters you come across a

736
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:48,790
Pokemon named Tigana

737
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:53,430
who was a companion to Xenia so really

738
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:55,270
this second clue is only to confirm the

739
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:57,850
Cinderella of the garden being the

740
00:33:55,270 --> 00:34:01,629
zinnia so we know we're looking for

741
00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:03,669
something zinnia related 78 north 15

742
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:08,650
east places you kind of in the middle of

743
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:11,110
nowhere digging deeper literally is

744
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:15,430
what's closest all barred which is the

745
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:19,210
global Seed Vault it is where we as as a

746
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:23,460
civilization are storing seeds to use if

747
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:25,420
we ever you know have an apocalypse and

748
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:29,170
everything gets destroyed and we have to

749
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:30,970
rebuild so kind of apocalypse themed so

750
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:34,120
we're looking for as India's at the

751
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:38,799
global Seed Vault I think I have the

752
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:41,380
link here for their public display of

753
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:44,590
you know what is in that Seed Vault when

754
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:46,030
you search for zinnia genus zinnia

755
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:48,240
there's a ton of results for different

756
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:51,040
zinnias there is only one true

757
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:54,100
vernacular names in iya it's also Zen

758
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:56,230
one in terms of the accession number you

759
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:58,720
can see that there's 500 seats so the

760
00:34:56,230 --> 00:35:00,580
number of seeds back to the clue is the

761
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:04,720
answer is 500 make the point a little

762
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:06,759
clearer yeah so it's so it definitely is

763
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:11,709
and I I have taken plenty of notes on

764
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:13,720
things that you know for future ocean

765
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:15,640
challenges that I write there are other

766
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:21,299
choices for zhenia I think some use

767
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:24,190
evidence in in in discord there's a

768
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:25,870
several different zinnias I think all of

769
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:27,250
them haven't have an addition to the

770
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:30,130
word zinnia so it's like the yellow

771
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:31,960
zinnia the elegant zinnia they have you

772
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:34,480
know random institution codes random

773
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:39,040
accession numbers there is only true one

774
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:42,490
true zinnia a singular entry that is the

775
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:44,830
vernacular named zinnia that is what the

776
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:45,640
companions name is the Pokemon that is

777
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:46,960
what the flower

778
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:49,150
so we're not looking for any of the

779
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,160
other versions of zinnias we're just

780
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:53,349
looking for the zinnia so that's 500 I

781
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:55,210
know a bunch of people added all of the

782
00:35:53,349 --> 00:35:58,299
different Sandhya's together so I think

783
00:35:55,210 --> 00:36:00,279
that was 4,500 and a lot of people put

784
00:35:58,299 --> 00:36:06,130
that in there so super super close but

785
00:36:00,279 --> 00:36:10,720
500 was the number of seeds meeting

786
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:13,299
through here questions I can answer that

787
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:15,038
question from velocity I'm sorry I'm

788
00:36:13,299 --> 00:36:16,299
reading it from a distance crystal was

789
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:17,710
the second speaker in Czech Mountain

790
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:20,740
they have a flag at the end of their

791
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:23,380
presentation not that I'm aware of that

792
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:26,169
would be news to me if you want to

793
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:27,519
message me this is Lin tile with what

794
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:29,170
you're talking about if you screenshot

795
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:44,288
under or whatever I'm happy to look into

796
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:47,559
it for you so I'm gonna move to last one

797
00:36:44,289 --> 00:36:50,349
portal I know this one left quite a few

798
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:52,329
people down you know that the 2:00 a.m.

799
00:36:50,349 --> 00:36:53,259
rabbit hole I apologize I thought it was

800
00:36:52,329 --> 00:36:56,259
fun

801
00:36:53,259 --> 00:36:58,329
I will I probably won't reduce the

802
00:36:56,259 --> 00:37:01,359
number of red herrings I put into these

803
00:36:58,329 --> 00:37:04,869
questions but it's funny so is the

804
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:06,009
apocalypse nears we have observed three

805
00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:08,140
hundred and thirty five thousand three

806
00:37:06,009 --> 00:37:09,819
hundred twelve ounces of its focal point

807
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:11,859
at the focal point in fact this many

808
00:37:09,819 --> 00:37:14,700
inches is required to view zero nine

809
00:37:11,859 --> 00:37:17,740
seven two five zero three seven zero six

810
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:18,910
through that 72 point oh four percent so

811
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:23,979
like I would be Oh note with question

812
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:27,250
reads so there's quite a lot in this

813
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:31,240
question a lot of things to search for a

814
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:33,430
lot of things to connect so when we look

815
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:36,008
at this kind of where I start at is this

816
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:38,500
zero nine seventy two number just a

817
00:37:36,009 --> 00:37:42,309
straight google of that is it's an ISBN

818
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:44,019
for a post apocalyptic comic named Fist

819
00:37:42,309 --> 00:37:47,829
of the North Star

820
00:37:44,019 --> 00:37:49,899
it looks fascinating so it's kind of the

821
00:37:47,829 --> 00:37:51,579
the thing to take away from that is the

822
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:54,569
North Star that's what we're trying to

823
00:37:51,579 --> 00:37:57,400
view the North Star is often used to

824
00:37:54,569 --> 00:37:59,410
kind of speak of you know apocalypse

825
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:03,490
nearing so it is

826
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:05,890
you know themed again semi 2.0 4% silica

827
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:07,660
alumina and iron oxide

828
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:10,150
I'll admit even though there is iron

829
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:13,589
oxide in it it is the red herring and

830
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:16,089
that it doesn't show you right away what

831
00:38:13,589 --> 00:38:17,799
you might be looking for but the silica

832
00:38:16,089 --> 00:38:20,230
and alumina for sure gets you the

833
00:38:17,799 --> 00:38:22,180
granite so we're also talking behemoth

834
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:24,819
granite is often used to create

835
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:27,930
monuments and behemoths so we're

836
00:38:24,819 --> 00:38:32,140
obviously looking for some sort of

837
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:36,609
monument or you know building or thing

838
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:40,200
that is made of granite to speak of or

839
00:38:36,609 --> 00:38:43,598
look at the North Star

840
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:47,410
so cross referencing North Star and

841
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:50,619
granite and again apocalypse it's kind

842
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:52,149
of the theme even if you did not have

843
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:53,890
apocalypse in there I know I have been

844
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:56,109
able to get to it but cross referencing

845
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:57,250
those and googling as you come across

846
00:38:56,109 --> 00:38:59,288
the Georgia Guidestones

847
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:02,230
I think I have a picture yep right there

848
00:38:59,289 --> 00:39:06,720
so these are this kind of insanely cool

849
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:09,430
cryptic not even explained until today

850
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:12,788
monument that is in Georgia it is made

851
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:15,069
out of granite it you should go look and

852
00:39:12,789 --> 00:39:17,650
read about it it is really really

853
00:39:15,069 --> 00:39:21,339
interesting a lot of kind of conspiracy

854
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:23,130
and we I don't even know what it means

855
00:39:21,339 --> 00:39:26,319
even today so it's kind of interesting

856
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:28,240
and if you literally Wikipedia it I

857
00:39:26,319 --> 00:39:29,950
think I saw somebody in the chat say I

858
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,200
know someone who lives close and I

859
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:34,210
almost had him go measure it um that

860
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:36,038
awesome I will give you points for that

861
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:38,710
if you had gotten me even a close

862
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:40,779
answered I will give you points I did

863
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:42,160
not need you to go physically to the

864
00:39:40,779 --> 00:39:44,020
item to measure it

865
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,000
Wikipedia speaks about the Georgia

866
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:51,849
Guidestones and it actually has physical

867
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:53,980
data about it it speaks of being able to

868
00:39:51,849 --> 00:39:56,650
view the North Star through the center

869
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:58,900
shown in the center element of this

870
00:39:56,650 --> 00:40:01,869
Monument so if you look at the center

871
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:03,789
stone 16 feet four inches high I did

872
00:40:01,869 --> 00:40:05,559
have kind of another way to verify

873
00:40:03,789 --> 00:40:07,690
you're on the right track if you

874
00:40:05,559 --> 00:40:08,799
remember in the question I had three

875
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:10,690
hundred and thirty five thousand three

876
00:40:08,799 --> 00:40:13,009
hundred twelve ounces if you convert

877
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:15,860
this to pounds it's the exact weight

878
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:19,160
that Wikipedia lists for that center

879
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:20,930
stone so it's 16 feet four inches which

880
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:24,040
if you convert is a hundred and

881
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:26,230
ninety-six inches so the answer is 196

882
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:29,029
so that's how I got there

883
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:30,830
let me tonight may I address the people

884
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:34,640
talking about the wording because I have

885
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:37,370
this discussion and I firmly believe

886
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:40,940
that a way that you can read this is how

887
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:43,970
high the actual portal is on the stone

888
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:45,890
to actually be able to get the right

889
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:48,169
angle to view the North Star

890
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:50,569
so you're interpreting it as how high

891
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:53,090
you're required to be it's how high the

892
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:56,770
whole has to be on the stone to be

893
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:56,770
required it's a point the right angle

894
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:16,940
okay all right um so center stone 196

895
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:19,820
inches I'll definitely read back through

896
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:22,400
these questions and I will have a more I

897
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:27,200
think detailed walk through this that

898
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:30,620
we'll post somewhere so that people can

899
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:34,569
look through how I got there but it was

900
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:36,650
fun super fun I know three of the four

901
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:39,110
you have more challenges more

902
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:41,360
controversy completely agree um so yeah

903
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:41,750
those are the four challenges that's all

904
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,160
I got

905
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:47,030
all right great thanks everybody

906
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:50,029
everybody all right let me talk really

907
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:53,420
quick one more thing about the program

908
00:41:50,030 --> 00:42:00,590
that Mike and I are looking at doing for

909
00:41:53,420 --> 00:42:04,550
oh there we go good enough okay

910
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:07,160
so little things before we talk about

911
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:09,530
the last piece one of the things that

912
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:12,680
Mike and I talked about at length about

913
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:14,480
wanting to promote this year was the

914
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:17,870
ability for people to get more

915
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:20,960
experience on writing up their CTF

916
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:23,210
challenges in meaningful ways not only

917
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,250
is it a good preparatory behavior

918
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:28,280
especially for people that have role

919
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:30,800
as analysts or anybody that is doing

920
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:33,200
some forensics or you know or any a sort

921
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,520
of assessment really so you know gets

922
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,640
you into the mode of technical writing

923
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:38,960
especially if you're new to the industry

924
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:41,569
so Mike do you want to kind of talk

925
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:44,630
through the the beginnings of the

926
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:54,380
program that we want to promote for

927
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:57,620
write-ups in CTL oh yeah no got it I'll

928
00:42:54,380 --> 00:43:02,600
take care of it so so so basically what

929
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:06,529
we're planning on doing is accepting so

930
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:10,240
in via a channel in the actual the

931
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:13,100
prophecies discord we will be dropping

932
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:16,729
information in there about where we will

933
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:19,490
accept write-ups or links to write-ups I

934
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:22,640
will put up a you know sort of what

935
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:25,850
we're expecting but the bottom line is I

936
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:27,560
want to see not only the things that you

937
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:29,810
did right but I also want to see the

938
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:32,870
different places where you know you

939
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:35,180
really had moments of realization or or

940
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:37,549
sort of wishing you know that you you

941
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:39,770
caught a part of the clue all of that is

942
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:42,500
instructive to talk about the way you're

943
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:45,170
thinking and trying to solve a problem

944
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:47,540
you know actually giving the command

945
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:49,700
line invitations or the actual URLs to

946
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:53,570
the different tools you used that's a

947
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:57,259
great piece of this as well so what

948
00:43:53,570 --> 00:44:00,500
we're going to be talking about is you

949
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:03,320
know basically accepting these write-ups

950
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:06,260
we will promote them along with along

951
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:09,110
with the challenges that that they have

952
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:12,680
you know been spawned from and then we

953
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:14,300
will award prizes basically at least one

954
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:17,629
prize for the best write-up for each

955
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:19,760
challenge one prize basically for the

956
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:21,920
best conclusive write-up if anybody sort

957
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:26,450
of like wrote it up altogether as well

958
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:29,150
as anything that we deemed to be above

959
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:31,549
the line in terms of either uniqueness

960
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:34,370
completeness or clarity so we'll

961
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:35,900
basically be trying to honorable mention

962
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:38,210
the one thing I'm going to be doing is

963
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:38,950
everybody who submits a write-up will at

964
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:42,339
least real

965
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:45,160
receive something from me as a prize you

966
00:44:42,339 --> 00:44:49,029
know it might not be a hundred percent

967
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:52,210
in terms of you know giant Amazon gift

968
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:55,000
cards or anything but I will I will send

969
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:57,579
you a prize of some sort if you submit

970
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,369
it right up to this so please stay in

971
00:44:57,579 --> 00:45:02,770
that discord like I said we're gonna be

972
00:45:00,369 --> 00:45:05,770
leaving it up for the next few days but

973
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:07,750
I will be posting where where to submit

974
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:11,619
those write-ups to to Mike and myself

975
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:14,109
and we will absolutely help you

976
00:45:11,619 --> 00:45:16,240
you know refine that skill and give you

977
00:45:14,109 --> 00:45:20,098
feedback as we have you know written or

978
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:20,098
consumed a lot of those ourselves

979
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:25,930
Lacroix milord you know we'll figure

980

00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:56,460
the channel for any follow-ups in our

990

1001
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:30,460
