1
00:00:00,869 --> 00:00:05,970
to come over to the dark side and Here I

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,790
am today

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:12,210
security automation engineer at Accra

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:15,410
sure I'm also a craft beer lover a

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:20,580
horror movie addict metal head and

6
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:23,910
privacy advocates so let's take a minute

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:28,500
to quickly discuss why I'm giving this

8
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:31,198
talk it originally came as an epiphany I

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,450
had while I was attending a previous con

10
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,649
last year I was sitting in the

11
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,300
conference room listening to a

12
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:39,780
presentation on reverse engineering

13
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:43,069
assembly language and I'm not gonna lie

14
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:46,200
started due to not off a little bit I

15
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:48,260
came to the conference to get ideas and

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:52,100
processes that I could take home with me

17
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:55,320
and listening to reverse engineering

18
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:58,230
assembly wasn't wasn't exactly one of

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:01,199
those things looking around I saw their

20
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,629
sysadmin x' IT directors and small teams

21
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,209
who also probably thought this you know

22
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:08,069
his talk was was super cool but they

23
00:01:06,209 --> 00:01:11,389
couldn't use the information they were

24
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:11,389
getting you know in a practical manner

25
00:01:11,509 --> 00:01:18,539
so this talk is going to be very high

26
00:01:14,639 --> 00:01:21,240
level I'm not dropping any mad CDs or

27
00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:22,529
say anything new or groundbreaking so

28
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,779
for any hackers or blue team's who are

29
00:01:22,529 --> 00:01:27,479
attending this might be a bit of a

30
00:01:24,779 --> 00:01:30,810
review for you so with that out of the

31
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:33,929
way let's get into it this first section

32
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,429
is going to go over the free stuff these

33
00:01:33,929 --> 00:01:37,289
are things that you either already have

34
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:38,759
in your environments or open source

35
00:01:37,289 --> 00:01:39,799
tools that you can leverage at no

36
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,899
additional cost

37
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:48,380
techo Alyssa's point from the keynotes

38
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:48,380
you don't need to buy all the things

39
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:57,029
first up is lapse lapse which is the

40
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:59,158
local admin password solution provides

41
00:01:57,029 --> 00:02:01,200
management of local passwords for domain

42
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,090
and joined computers passwords are

43
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,819
stored securely in Active Directory

44
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:10,079
and protected by ACL so only eligible

45
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:11,819
users can read it or request its reset

46
00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:14,100
all right so what problem are we trying

47
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:16,320
to solve with this thread actors

48
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,480
can and will laterally move throughout

49
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:21,660
your environment using the built-in

50
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,609
local administrator account on a PC when

51
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,100
they eventually crack that password

52
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:30,030
because they're going to it's a it's a

53
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:31,769
matter of fact at this point it's taking

54
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:34,830
advantage of our build process as well

55
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:38,400
right when a new PC or server is spun up

56
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:41,010
we're often using a CCM or some sort of

57
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,590
golden image that probably has the

58
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:44,700
administrator password set already

59
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:47,220
deploying lapse will make it so that

60
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,530
every PC and server has a very long and

61
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:53,130
unique password stored in an Active

62
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:56,580
Directory attribute of that PC or server

63
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:59,850
item in AD and can be rotated on a

64
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:02,300
configured schedule of your choosing so

65
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:04,230
what is deploying this to look like

66
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,900
Microsoft thankfully makes it really

67
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:08,820
easy the link to package or the link to

68
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,580
the the package you need to download and

69
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:13,920
install it is located in the slide but

70
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:16,770
you can also easily Google Apps and

71
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,350
you'll get them all the same so what is

72
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:21,180
it that we're downloading we're going to

73
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:23,100
be on the install package which is going

74
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,860
to be used to control the password

75
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:29,820
setting in rotation of your endpoints as

76
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:32,100
well as an admin interface to look up an

77
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:34,560
admin password rather than needing to go

78
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,870
digging that et attribute if you if you

79
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,780
don't want to we're also downloading the

80
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:44,580
documentation because RTFM is very well

81
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:45,900
you know still still applicable here you

82
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,760
definitely want to make sure that you

83
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:51,840
understand this documentation and review

84
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,549
it before you go about this you can also

85
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,250
implement this as fast or as slow as you

86
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:58,530
want because the agent is pushed out via

87
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:01,890
GPO and the GPO needed to enforce

88
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:03,380
elapsed are thankfully that GPOs that

89
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:09,510
means you can start with the test group

90
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:15,799
or test though you expand on that as you

91
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:18,048
feel comfortable couple consideration

92
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:20,030
when deploying laps using laps in a

93
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:21,349
largely distributed environment it can

94
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:23,570
be a little tricky especially in today's

95
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:27,460
kovat environment with everybody working

96
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:30,440
from home and not everybody necessarily

97
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:32,870
connecting or talking to your local

98
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:36,020
Active Directory every day so in order

99
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:39,110
for this to to work your pcs need to be

100
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:41,419
able to contact the local domain if

101
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:45,950
you're an into subscriber I would

102
00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:48,770
recommend you looking to slaps our

103
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:50,870
server serverless laps but we're not

104
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:55,760
going to get into that too much but it's

105
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:58,490
a another great solution to using laps

106
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:03,590
in a you know largely undistribute or

107
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:06,850
more distributed environment so next

108
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:09,950
we're going to talk about is pink castle

109
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:12,980
pink castle is a great audit tool for

110
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:15,490
Active Directory as you can see here in

111
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:18,710
the slide there's a couple steps to to

112
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:21,229
using it you can download it at pink

113
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:24,979
castle comm as long as you're not an MSP

114
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:28,700
or MSSP or you know you're trying to

115
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:31,539
make money off the reports or you know

116
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:33,740
we're mediating them for another company

117
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:38,000
it's covered under the open-source

118
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:40,000
license download run that and then it

119
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,630
actually generates really pretty reports

120
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,700
that breaks down exactly what security

121
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:51,500
flaws and things that is found in your

122
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:56,719
Active Directory so here's a 15 example

123
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:58,520
report that was ran you can see it's

124
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,930
broken up into actionable items give you

125
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,669
a knight gives you a nice risk score

126
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:04,280
that your managers and your your C

127
00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:07,370
levels are going to like and then breaks

128
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:15,219
it out by risk model on highlights what

129
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:15,220
sure most vulnerable areas are

130
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:21,689
to break it down even more this the I

131
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:25,919
should also mention the report spits out

132
00:06:21,689 --> 00:06:28,139
in a really nice HTML document and as

133
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:31,080
you go down the report it actually

134
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:34,490
breaks out each finding that it has and

135
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:39,359
gives you details what kind of points

136
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:41,610
that it with the how it got to that

137
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,129
score and gives you each points and how

138
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:48,270
to remediate each along with a nice

139
00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:56,460
explanation as far as what it found and

140
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:58,409
why that's a problem so pass phrases are

141
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:01,109
up next pass phrases pass phrases are

142
00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:04,710
awesome I nerd out when it comes to

143
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:07,830
passwords and password security so what

144
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:11,818
problem are we fixing by requiring or

145
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:15,020
using pass phrases you already know it

146
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:17,699
but I'll say it anyways and to steal

147
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:20,669
words from the mouth of chris Roberts

148
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:22,639
passwords friggin suck our complexity

149
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:26,159
requirements today are usually garbage

150
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:28,080
or are very good

151
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:30,539
we've had our users incorrectly for

152
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,830
years using an e character password with

153
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:35,818
caps and numbers and special characters

154
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:38,190
and all those things but is what we've

155
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:40,949
historically set the problem with that

156
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:43,020
is that one or 20/20 or winter 20/20

157
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:49,349
exclamation mark actually meets those

158
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:51,930
requirements so we need another way so

159
00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:55,349
how do we do it better we increase

160
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:58,169
password length to 15 characters or more

161
00:07:55,349 --> 00:08:03,620
remove complexity requirements and

162
00:07:58,169 --> 00:08:05,878
expire less frequently or not at all

163
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07,469
expiring less frequently or not at all

164
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:09,719
will help prevent your employees from

165
00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:11,520
setting bad passwords because they

166
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:14,310
aren't iterating through their old

167
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:17,490
password by changing a letter or a

168
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:21,029
number or adding an exclamation point or

169
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:23,550
wonderful friends here at xkcd have the

170
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:26,729
best graphic I've seen not that explains

171
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:28,620
this muscle police you know if you can

172
00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:31,440
google this and grab it or take a

173
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:33,210
screenshot right now if we need to to

174
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,039
two decision-makers if you get pushback

175
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:39,060
on this because again at the end of a

176
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:40,919
day we need passwords nobody to my

177
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:43,859
knowledge has come out with with

178
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:46,829
something that is a replacement for

179
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:49,440
passwords yet at this time so that's

180
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:56,750
something we need to be aware of and

181
00:08:49,440 --> 00:09:01,170
secured properly passphrases an ad that

182
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:02,850
LM hash though so we've got we've still

183
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:05,849
got quite a few slides and grounds to

184
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:09,090
cover so I can't get into you know

185
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:18,090
exactly what the LM hash is or why it's

186
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:20,100
stored but but know this because of an

187
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:22,890
awesome thing called rainbow tables we

188
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,030
can crack most passwords stored as an

189
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:26,430
alum hash if you're not familiar with

190
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:28,050
rainbow tables my employee do some

191
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:30,900
research but the long and short of it is

192
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:32,880
rainbow tables are pre calculated hash

193
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:36,360
tables to make password cracking that

194
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,800
much easier and quicker so the simplest

195
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,220
way to prevent Windows from storing in

196
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,660
alum hash is actually to make your make

197
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,540
sure your password is at least 15

198
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:47,400
characters long in this case windows

199
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:50,849
stores an LM hash value that cannot be

200
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:53,130
used to authorize the user so if it does

201
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:54,870
get dumped or or captured

202
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:57,630
you know when they crack it it's not

203
00:09:54,870 --> 00:10:05,670
gonna knock ya or not gonna be of any

204
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:10,200
use to them Bay Locker because your

205
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:12,420
laptop's will walk away so let's encrypt

206
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,130
all the things because your laptop's are

207
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,780
gonna walk away and your C level is

208
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:19,430
going to leave a surface book on that

209
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:22,680
taxi or in the airport or whatever

210
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:25,160
thankfully BitLocker is built right into

211
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:30,329
Windows 10 Pro or greater versions and

212
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:33,930
when you encrypt a PC with BitLocker you

213
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:36,030
know and exports a decryption key that

214
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:38,040
you can then store hopefully in your MDM

215
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:42,990
if you're fortunate enough to have an

216
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:45,000
MDM solution or if not nad as an

217
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:46,620
attribute

218
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,010
or you know if you must in a secure

219
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:52,260
location you know in an IT file share

220
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:58,170
somewhere if that's your only option at

221
00:10:52,260 --> 00:11:00,090
that point so these next two controls

222
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:03,599
we're going to talk about could have

223
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:06,990
very adverse impacts if not fully tested

224
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,500
and understood before implementation so

225
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:13,770
make sure before you do these you

226
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:17,190
research them to their fullest and have

227
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:22,020
gone over what the impacts might be when

228
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:25,620
when implementing these LSA protection

229
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:28,949
Mimi Katz no amor so there's a whole

230
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:31,320
rich history around Mimi Katz basically

231
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:33,860
some French guy really ruled really

232
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:36,810
ruined everybody's day and Microsoft

233
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:40,080
when he dumped this this awesome tool

234
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:43,469
that that red teamers use to my

235
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:45,870
knowledge on almost every engagement so

236
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:48,180
at a high level Mimi Katz is an

237
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:49,230
application used to dump else asks for

238
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:53,370
the purpose of cracking passwords

239
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:56,850
offline after the fact enable enabling

240
00:11:53,370 --> 00:12:01,200
LSA auditing via a registry key on test

241
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:07,440
systems can help us go towards the first

242
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:13,680
step in securing else s and LS a so when

243
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:16,620
you enable this registry key you it will

244
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:20,640
create Windows events of thirty sixty

245
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:22,440
five and thirty sixty six which will

246
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:26,339
give you indications of what

247
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:28,560
applications are interacting with LSA so

248
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:31,170
that you can do research and make sure

249
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,819
that before you enable LSA protection

250
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:39,500
that any applications that are

251
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:43,500
interacting with LSA are basically are

252
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:46,050
supported for using LSA protection and

253
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:48,440
then so finally you know to enable LSA

254
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:52,260
protection is also just a simple GPO

255
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:55,890
thankfully Microsoft once again is a

256
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:57,209
great guide on this which you know the

257
00:12:55,890 --> 00:13:00,319
links there but you can also you know

258
00:12:57,209 --> 00:13:00,319
feel free to

259
00:13:02,299 --> 00:13:09,389
so next up is LL M&R NetBIOS and W pad

260
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:13,949
so what problem are we trying to solve

261
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:16,439
by disabling these protocols a wonderful

262
00:13:13,949 --> 00:13:19,049
Red Team tool called responder responder

263
00:13:16,439 --> 00:13:21,209
is an application that listens for

264
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:23,549
requests on these protocols with the end

265
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:27,388
goal of getting password crashes or

266
00:13:23,549 --> 00:13:30,299
password hashes to crack this isn't a

267
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:32,789
Red Team talk so as with Mimi cats you

268
00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:36,809
know I employee I employ you to take a

269
00:13:32,789 --> 00:13:41,539
look around and do you research on these

270
00:13:36,809 --> 00:13:43,589
applications and these protocols as well

271
00:13:41,539 --> 00:13:45,959
the fix for this is very straightforward

272
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:48,239
thankfully once again there GPOs for

273
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:49,559
these protocols to disable them but

274
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:52,699
you're going to want to start with a few

275
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:55,889
test machines and work with your team to

276
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:57,539
identify any legacy applications or

277
00:13:55,889 --> 00:14:01,319
other cases that still leverage these

278
00:13:57,539 --> 00:14:04,529
protocols I know in the past especially

279
00:14:01,319 --> 00:14:08,238
with NetBIOS W pad I personally have

280
00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:10,709
breaking some legacy protocols just

281
00:14:08,239 --> 00:14:12,479
during during my testing phases so I

282
00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:20,069
definitely make sure you do research on

283
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:22,319
those before you set forth our last set

284
00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:23,969
of controls are the bottom half of this

285
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:27,598
presentation is going to be on office

286
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:29,489
365 controls and to preface this all the

287
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:32,489
changes that I'm going to show you

288
00:14:29,489 --> 00:14:38,399
assume that you have an e3 license and a

289
00:14:32,489 --> 00:14:41,549
minimum first up is geo blocking does

290
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:45,449
your company work primarily in the US of

291
00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:47,608
A or a few select countries then why

292
00:14:45,449 --> 00:14:50,248
allow logins from places where you don't

293
00:14:47,609 --> 00:14:51,509
actually do business saying this control

294
00:14:50,249 --> 00:14:54,179
is done through conditional access

295
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:55,849
policy and AD as well as a few other the

296
00:14:54,179 --> 00:14:57,659
controls we're gonna look at today

297
00:14:55,849 --> 00:14:59,909
that's why does this work

298
00:14:57,659 --> 00:15:02,999
Azure ad allows you to create names

299
00:14:59,909 --> 00:15:05,159
locations and you create a location with

300
00:15:02,999 --> 00:15:08,339
all the countries that you don't have a

301
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:10,319
presence in and create a conditional

302
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:11,950
access rule to block logins from those

303
00:15:10,319 --> 00:15:13,719
locations

304
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:15,880
many people have pointed out to me that

305
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:19,030
this can be circumvented with the VPN

306
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:21,010
which we acknowledge but this will

307
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:23,829
protect you against the bots and CDs who

308
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:29,319
who aren't that smart it's a reason why

309
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:33,040
we have defense-in-depth right so next

310
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:35,410
up is blocking basic authentication this

311
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,930
is to help you with credential stuffing

312
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:41,860
BOTS another automated automated attacks

313
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:45,370
most often leverage IMAP and pop3 for

314
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:47,410
their automated attacks disabling basic

315
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:49,840
authentication drastically shrinks your

316
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:55,030
attack surface so what doing this does

317
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:57,640
is forces modern authentication and if

318
00:15:55,030 --> 00:16:00,339
you are using office 365 I guarantee you

319
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:02,650
that you've seen my authentication when

320
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:05,530
you log into poor old at office.com or

321
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:08,140
poor old at Azure comm and you know you

322
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:10,360
get the nice pretty sign in box we have

323
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:15,720
to fill in you know your your creds and

324
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:18,910
then provide MFA hopefully that is

325
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,680
modern authentication so when you

326
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:25,300
enforce my authentication all of your

327
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:27,250
clients from Outlook to your iPhones are

328
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:33,099
going to require modern authentication

329
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:35,260
so if they initially if they initially

330
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:38,170
set up were set up with basic

331
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:41,439
authentication especially I've seen this

332
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:44,849
very prevalent on iPhones when the mail

333
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:48,250
app was set up with basic authentication

334
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:50,500
and you turn this on after the fact or

335
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:53,920
enforce modern authentication after the

336
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:55,510
fact but you do have to x remove the

337
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:59,050
account and re-add it so that it

338
00:16:55,510 --> 00:17:01,750
renegotiates with modern authentication

339
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:02,920
as it'll keep prompting from the

340
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:06,689
password over and over and over again

341
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,688
without any success

342
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:14,909
alerts for new inbox rules because

343
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:18,360
moving all items from a sender to the

344
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:21,300
RSS folder that has the word invoice in

345
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:24,270
it it's totally legit right so a common

346
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:26,688
IOC and email account takeovers is a

347
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:29,940
creation of inbox rules to obscure

348
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:32,700
malicious activity you can easily create

349
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:36,470
an alert for this in alert policies

350
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:40,710
under the security center of office 365

351
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:42,570
in doing so your sock team or yourself

352
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:44,460
or your helpdesk you know however you

353
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:46,409
want to handle it will get an email

354
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:49,650
alert anytime an inbox rule is created

355
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:52,070
now you might think I'm crazy that that

356
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:55,970
seems like it would be a lot of chatter

357
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:58,439
but in implementing this in production

358
00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:00,630
you'd be surprised at how little inbox

359
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:05,190
rules actually get created especially

360
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:08,250
after you know if this environment is

361
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:10,610
one that has been in use for a while so

362
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:12,210
if it you know if you're going from a

363
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:15,120
environment that has been recently

364
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:18,960
migrated then you know this might be

365
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:21,209
chatty initially but after a while you

366
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:25,130
should easily be able to investigate

367
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:25,130
these without being overwhelmed

368
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:32,250
disabling external auto forwards is

369
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:36,300
another very easy control that you can

370
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:39,390
do to prevent data exfil so come away

371
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:41,940
forthright actors to excel data is to

372
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:45,660
auto forward all emails to an external

373
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:49,500
address normally we do this or we

374
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:51,240
normally thread actors do this on the

375
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:54,510
account itself rather than creating an

376
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:57,750
inbox rule so that can also be disabled

377
00:18:54,510 --> 00:19:00,170
with an exchange level mail flow rule so

378
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:03,870
I have an example over there on the side

379
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:05,580
and as you can see if the sender is

380
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:08,280
located inside the organisation and the

381
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:12,710
message type is an auto forward you can

382
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:17,010
actually disable or reject the message

383
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:19,800
from going out I have seen some pushback

384
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:22,290
on this one especially from executives

385
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,419
who for whatever

386
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:28,050
reason forward their emails to their

387
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:32,700
personal accounts so it's a conversation

388
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:36,210
that you know needs to be had but this

389
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:38,820
rule is in a very easy way to make sure

390
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:47,430
that when an incident does happen it

391
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:50,460
doesn't end up as a data breach mfa all

392
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:52,860
the things because I'm gonna keep saying

393
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:54,840
it until you do it i'm fá can be broadly

394
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:59,699
enforced to be a jerk conditional access

395
00:19:54,840 --> 00:20:04,470
policies so you can grant or grant

396
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:06,840
access require MFA authentication via

397
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:09,840
conditional access policies all these

398
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:11,490
policies are very easy to set up but if

399
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,980
you're not familiar with them or or have

400
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:15,780
never done them before I'd be happy to

401
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:18,450
help you with that or answer any

402
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:21,210
questions you can hit me up after after

403
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:23,190
the talk for for any questions you have

404
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:30,570
about potential access policies or

405
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:34,290
office 365 controls in general so let's

406
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:37,409
get out of our tech bubbles you know to

407
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:39,899
echo some points that Alyssa had

408
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:41,990
mentioned yesterday at the end of the

409
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:44,010
day your business is going to win when

410
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:46,710
you need to make a decision especially

411
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:49,230
InfoSec so understand your business not

412
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:52,040
just your business systems learn to make

413
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:54,600
business cases for your perceived needs

414
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:57,060
talk their talk you know communicate

415
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:59,040
with business language secure and enable

416
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:01,200
your business to run

417
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,909
do you understand capex which is FX

418
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,240
while your business might hate up X

419
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:09,060
these are some points to to really dive

420
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,880
into and understand that'll help you

421
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:15,300
elevate your career as you're talking

422
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:16,590
and making decisions especially some of

423
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:20,070
the ones we've talked about today there

424
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:23,010
can be adverse impacts so make sure that

425
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:27,570
you're talking with your business not to

426
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:30,210
your business and unfortunately with

427
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:34,889
this being my first talk I talked way

428
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:35,539

429
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:39,229
