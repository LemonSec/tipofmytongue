1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,540
find stocker where s software used to

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:09,360
facilitate intimate partner violence

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:11,969
abuse or harassment including pernicious

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,969
intrusions into the targeted person's

5
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:18,630
life by way of physical or digital

6
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:20,039
actions so stalker wear can include

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:28,680
stock aware itself

8
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:30,359
spyware dual use apps and M rats so what

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,579
are additional intimate partner

10
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,530
surveillance tools right so we have of

11
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:37,410
course the commodity stock aware we have

12
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,899
the spyware we have dual use apps such

13
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:43,589
as Find My Phone right

14
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:46,410
Emre we have shared accounts o since

15
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:49,980
social media they can also leverage your

16
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:51,809
friends and family like oh you know Xena

17
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,449
said that she was gonna meet me at

18
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:56,940
such-and-such a time and she isn't here

19
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:57,989
do you know where she is or what she's

20
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,030
doing

21
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:01,440
let's say you know I get back to my

22
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,960
partner and they're like where were you

23
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,899
what were you doing you said you were at

24
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,760
lunch and I need to see a receipt with

25
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,180
the timestamp right

26
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:15,450
so they they can use creative means to

27
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,520
basically stock your life right so

28
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,810
commodity stocker where if there's

29
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:24,119
different levels it's kind of like

30
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:27,420
varying tiers or levels of payment so

31
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:30,780
you know on the low end you get basic

32
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:33,600
information like pass like like call

33
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:37,380
logs maybe a little bit of the calendar

34
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:41,009
some Chad apps maybe some SMS definitely

35
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:42,990
browser history right GPS location and

36
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:46,350
then it kind of goes up from there like

37
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:51,679
all the way up to keystrokes being able

38
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:55,229
to get your the the lock screen code and

39
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,810
prices range from about 50 to 200 bucks

40
00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:05,430
monthly quarterly or even annual

41
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:07,979
subscriptions so what what exactly does

42
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:11,160
stalker wear like do what do they take

43
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:12,270
right so I did a little icon for a lot

44
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,490
of the different things of course

45
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,410
browser history like I said

46
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:19,110
Twitter they can they can see all of

47
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:21,380
that Skype your photos all your videos

48
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:24,000
your voicemails your emails your

49
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:26,310
photographs your settings they can even

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,660
check your network settings and change

51
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:31,920
it your battery life they can listen to

52
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:35,520
your surroundings

53
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:39,299
they can of course know your location

54
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:42,090
look at all your contacts find out if

55
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:46,110
you're on Wi-Fi like it impacts Apple

56
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:50,640
and Android devices so there's a lot

57
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:52,880
that stock aware can do and it's not

58
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,609
good

59
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:58,590
here's a list of various vendors

60
00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:00,810
compliments of the citizens lab they

61
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,480
kind of they kind of give you a heads up

62
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:07,200
aura I just a shopping menu for abusers

63
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:10,829
to of like hmm I want to know her GPS

64
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,290
and I want to know you know like her

65
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:16,110
calendar so I can see where she's at who

66
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:18,450
she's meeting with and I want to know

67
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:20,760
all of the different calls that she's

68
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:24,209
made who she's speaking to she's text

69
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:27,269
messaging all of that right so you can

70
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:30,150
kind of pick what it is that you want or

71
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:33,690
need or whatever want to know about your

72
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:35,910
partner right so here's just some of the

73
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:37,620
vendors and more there's so many of them

74
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:41,670
like it's ridiculous

75
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:45,600
for instance mobi stealth they provide

76
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:48,179
information on how to disable two-factor

77
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:51,690
authentication when accessing a victim's

78
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:55,890
iCloud account mSpy lets you hide the

79
00:03:51,690 --> 00:04:00,299
icon flexi spy even reports when

80
00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:03,510
messages are deleted so there's there's

81
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:07,739
a lot and each one does different things

82
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:10,590
right just depends what you want so how

83
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:14,430
does it work how does it work exactly

84
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:16,918
so for commodity stalker we're basically

85
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:20,608
physical access is required to the

86
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:23,750
device internet access and for Android

87
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:27,510
devices they need to have the ability to

88
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:30,360
install apps from unknown sources

89
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:33,870
and Apple basically either a jailbroken

90
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:38,700
phone or access to the iCloud account

91
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:42,210
right so that's basically summed up very

92
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:45,510
simplified and believe it or not the

93
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:47,489
lockheed-martin kill chain can apply to

94
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:49,620
stark aware as well commodity stock

95
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:52,970
aware and I'll give you an example of

96
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:55,200
Android right now so you start out with

97
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:57,780
reconnaissance right information

98
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:01,229
gathering on the target I'll just use me

99
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:03,869
as an example right find out what I like

100
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:06,450
what I would possibly click on like dog

101
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:09,800
pictures I love I love dog and cat

102
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:13,320
pictures so of course if I wanted to

103
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:15,630
like see a close closer up of the cute

104
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,880
dog I would click on the picture right

105
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:21,150
so there's there's that I'm a sucker

106
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,250
it's okay I know weaponization so they

107
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:26,789
obtained the URL for stalker where they

108
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:29,430
purchased the service or um some of the

109
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:32,970
starter where vendors are so nice they

110
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:36,450
they offer sometimes 24/7 service of

111
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:38,700
being able to offer tech support to

112
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:42,440
people that want to install stalker

113
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:46,409
where on their partner or persons device

114
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:49,320
so delivery obtain physical access to

115
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:51,210
the targeted device and that could be

116
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:55,409
while they're sleeping mother in the

117
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:57,150
shower um you know through brute force

118
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:58,650
method it's like if you don't give me

119
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:02,479
your phone right now that means you

120
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:05,400
don't love me right and then finally um

121
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:09,780
really now we're in the exploitation

122
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:13,409
phase and there really isn't technical

123
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:16,109
exploits per se for commodity stalker

124
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:18,630
where it's more or less like a social

125
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:21,020
engineering the target to get the phone

126
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:28,050
to unlock the screen

127
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:32,490
I had my iPhone someone used dental mold

128
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:35,430
on my iPhone to lift the prints on it to

129
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:39,030
gain ax to try to gain access so it's

130
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:41,110
just uh like how how can I convince her

131
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:43,989
to leave her phone alone with me

132
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:46,540
or how can I do it quickly enough while

133
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:49,030
she's in the shower right or do I

134
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:54,180
suggest she has a longer shower stuff

135
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:58,000
like that right and then basically you

136
00:06:54,180 --> 00:07:00,640
configure all the settings right and you

137
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,690
install either from the Google Play

138
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:06,669
Store or the vendor provided link so it

139
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:09,910
just it just depends and then there's

140
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:12,870
command and control usually over Wi-Fi

141
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:15,400
sometimes over cell service and then

142
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:18,360
action zone objectives right so

143
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:22,000
unauthorized access to data on the phone

144
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,050
exfil data and possibly sometimes

145
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,270
modified data

146
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:28,270
I know parts of my calendar were

147
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:33,789
modified so if that can happen to me I'm

148
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:36,280
sure that happened to other people so to

149
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:41,500
sum up basically commodity stock aware

150
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:43,150
is easy to use it's legal ish like don't

151
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:46,000
quote me on that you know consult a

152
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:49,450
lawyer bla bla all of that it's cheap

153
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:53,410
it's readily available I downloaded two

154
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:56,820
samples earlier this week for free and

155
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:59,650
it has similar capabilities and

156
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:02,770
permission requests as imrat and spyware

157
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:06,849
and there's really no user interaction

158
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:08,650
because the attacker does it right

159
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:13,480
because they have physical access and

160
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:15,489
then no really technical skill and of

161
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:19,180
course the drawback is the attacker

162
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:23,190
needs physical access to the phone so

163
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:25,780
here's the M rat it's cheap ish

164
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:29,350
sometimes remote installation but it

165
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:34,270
requires specific knowledge to get them

166
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:37,390
rat right to be able to get the user

167
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:40,390
interaction social engineer to click and

168
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:42,610
it does require technical skill and it's

169
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:45,400
illegal so there's that too

170
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:49,570
and believe it or not mitre attack

171
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:52,829
actually has TTP's that mapped back to

172
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:55,830
various activities that's starker where

173
00:08:52,830 --> 00:09:02,570
mobile rats do and you can take a look

174
00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:07,430
at that so citizens lab did a review of

175
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:11,300
stalker wear and basically stated that

176
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:14,160
AV engines are horrible at detecting it

177
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:16,680
horrible especially when stark aware

178
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,410
comes out with new versions like oh my

179
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:24,829
gosh like the detection right by a via

180
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:28,500
vendors is like very very slim so yeah

181
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:32,940
having basically the same type of access

182
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:36,720
as like a mobile rat and it being

183
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:42,600
cheaper and less technical skill and not

184
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:45,390
really detected by by the engines for

185
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:50,180
instance the trace by newer versions of

186
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:54,720
it in this particular report had 0% 0%

187
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:59,060
cut by AV so that's definitely something

188
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:01,770
to consider so who are the targets

189
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:04,050
Morgan here says that the victims are

190
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:08,550
everyday people like myself I'm an

191
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:13,770
everyday person I am NOT a CEO you know

192
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:16,140
don't run multinational corporation and

193
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:18,150
the main target is relationships

194
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:20,240
obviously because it has to do with

195
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:25,020
intimate partner surveillance and

196
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:27,780
domestic violence right but what if we

197
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:30,329
take the similar characteristics of

198
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:33,209
surveillance cuz that's basically I was

199
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:36,450
surveilled for you know almost two years

200
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:38,580
and the capabilities of stark aware as

201
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:42,750
far as having access to information and

202
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:45,140
data and applying that to other targets

203
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:48,300
so we'll have a brief discussion of that

204
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:51,330
so for instance children the parenting

205
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:53,400
apps monitoring what their children are

206
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:56,190
doing where they're seeing who they're

207
00:10:53,400 --> 00:11:00,209
talking to their web history all of that

208
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:02,820
right then we have employees bosses

209
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:05,610
wanting to know what the heck the

210
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:07,600
employees are up to there is a company

211
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:11,620
that I worked for

212
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:15,760
many years ago had put tracking devices

213
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:17,890
on their employees phones to find out

214
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,200
where they were at because they were

215
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:23,140
usually around you know driving trucks

216
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:25,750
and doing that type of stuff I'm not

217
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:28,090
going to give away the employer so they

218
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:31,600
wanted to keep track of what the heck

219
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:34,210
they were up to the other one is

220
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,700
journalists so the citizens lab put out

221
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:40,810
a report recently I think it was a

222
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:42,550
couple months ago and they shared all

223
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:45,219
the various journalists that were

224
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:50,620
targeted by specifically Anna solos

225
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:56,350
group Pegasus which is a advanced stock

226
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:58,870
aware super super advanced right so an

227
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:03,280
example of this is a Washington Post

228
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:08,730
reporter was assassinated and then the

229
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:11,860
Friends of this assassinated journalist

230
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:15,160
were attacked or attempted to be

231
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:17,440
attacked by Ana so they were sent Ino

232
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:19,689
messages to try to compromise their

233
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,690
device to see what type of

234
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:24,970
communications were going on so not only

235
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:26,740
are the journalists targeted but also

236
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:32,620
the people that are close to the

237
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:35,800
journalists so that's not good the other

238
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:38,470
thing is dissidents and in lighter

239
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:42,819
recent events so black lives matter post

240
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:46,600
protesters were targeted in 2014 in

241
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:50,710
downtown Chicago by law enforcement with

242
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:54,040
stalker where China uses WeChat to spy

243
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:57,040
on their citizens and recently Hong Kong

244
00:12:54,040 --> 00:13:02,610
residents were targeted via a watering

245
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:05,860
hole attack to install iphone spyware

246
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:09,760
religious leaders are even targeted by

247
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:11,620
spyware and you know stalker where for

248
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:16,450
instance Tibetans working for the Dalai

249
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:20,310
Lama and also to Muslims targeted by

250
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:24,810
Chinese hackers via a watering hole

251
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:26,489
with iPhone exploits the other people

252
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:30,859
that are targeted or criminals

253
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:33,720
of course oh here's a good story so

254
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:38,370
european law enforcement they were using

255
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:42,630
NSO's group spyware pegasus via whatsapp

256
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:45,330
and whatsapp was like what what's going

257
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:48,150
on right so they sent out a message to

258
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:50,730
all the people that were impacted by

259
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:51,870
this particular exploit and said you've

260
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:55,590
been hacked

261
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:58,560
so european law enforcement we're using

262
00:13:55,590 --> 00:14:00,570
that to track a known terrorist and when

263
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,420
what's up put out that message the

264
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:06,690
terrace is like oh like I'm dropping

265
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:08,699
that phone yeah I'm no longer

266
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:12,660
communicating on that and they went dark

267
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:17,460
and the trail went cold so it's used

268
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:20,180
against terrorists the other one is so

269
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:23,670
tic-tock tic-tock is interesting it's

270
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:25,979
known as a dual use app and it's

271
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:32,420
actually been banned by the u.s. army

272
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:36,330
the US Navy I believe the Pentagon also

273
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:40,050
basically they're like yeah no no.2

274
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:42,990
tick-tock and a report by lookout

275
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:46,650
describes an M rat and it's called

276
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:50,190
stealth mango and in it they describe

277
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:53,640
how government officials were targeted

278
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:55,830
by this particular emirate and because

279
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:57,270
those people were targeted in government

280
00:14:55,830 --> 00:15:00,210
officials of course talked to other

281
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:03,000
government officials and other you know

282
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:05,370
quote-unquote important people those

283
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:12,720
important people were also compromised

284
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:15,780
as well so that's not good operators so

285
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:21,780
the typical operators of starka where

286
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:24,300
our attackers abusers I was gonna say

287
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:26,280
mentally unstable people but we won't go

288
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:30,449
there I don't need to be slinging

289
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:33,699
insults right the other thing is through

290
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:38,740
the stock aware vendor breaches cuz yeah

291
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:40,950
we'll talk about that later the who

292
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:43,570
wasn't motherboard they filed a lawsuit

293
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:46,200
against or they filed a complaint

294
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:49,120
actually against the Metropolitan Police

295
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:52,390
because through the breach of flexi pot

296
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:55,240
flexi spy they realized that they were

297
00:15:52,390 --> 00:16:00,030
purchasing this particular software

298
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:05,290
right and the Metropolitan Police

299
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:07,780
refused to look into it and it's unknown

300
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:11,020
whether they were using it for official

301
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:13,780
means or if they were using it against

302
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:19,510
their partners or whatever and they just

303
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:21,850
used their police email who knows yeah

304
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:25,240
Ashley Madison that's all I like to say

305
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:29,020
and then mobi stealth that was another

306
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:36,180
compromise and in that let's see the

307
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:38,890
military FBI ice THS TSA who knows

308
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:42,550
several branches of the military two

309
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:44,590
were found in that dump so we're gonna

310
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:47,349
do the same thing with targets as

311
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:51,280
operators so similar surveillance

312
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:55,870
capabilities as stock over right we have

313
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:59,199
parents using it against their kids and

314
00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:01,180
then schools as well there was a six

315
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:04,030
hundred and ten thousand dollar

316
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:06,369
settlement from a school in Seattle that

317
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:09,209
was trying to use the webcam of the

318
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:12,729
students to spy on the students and

319
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:16,560
schools more and more are looking to

320
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:19,630
bring on stalker where or spyware to

321
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:22,389
help combat school violence and to make

322
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:24,339
sure that students are doing what

323
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:29,590
they're supposed to be doing so there's

324
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:32,440
that companies so the FTC actually

325
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:38,159
banned Retina X from selling stock aware

326
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:42,370
so that was good and then in March ish

327
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:44,800
when the covered stuff went down bosses

328
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:47,020
were like oh my god how are we gonna you

329
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:50,200
know watch our employees right so

330
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:53,379
they were scrambling by spy software to

331
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:56,380
monitor their employees so this is a

332
00:17:53,380 --> 00:18:00,820
very relevant like thing that happens

333
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:03,340
like now right now cybercrime

334
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:07,149
hacktivists I don't need to go into that

335
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:09,669
so criminals also use the spyware

336
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:14,470
stalker where and terrorist so here's a

337
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:17,680
good story El Chapo loved to use spyware

338
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:20,860
against his partners and leaders in his

339
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:24,970
organization but ultimately the stalker

340
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:28,000
where spyware is what enabled the FBI to

341
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:33,840
collect intel on him and take him down

342
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,840
so this is where paranoia does not pay

343
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:41,950
law enforcement so Miami police have its

344
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:44,980
own stark aware made called pen link the

345
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:48,490
Swedish police got approval to install

346
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:51,490
spyware on criminals phones starting in

347
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:58,440
March of 2020 so a couple months ago and

348
00:18:51,490 --> 00:19:01,750
then a city lab revealed that celebrate

349
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:07,290
allows cops to gather visible and hidden

350
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:10,540
or deleted data and they also invest in

351
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:15,820
cell phone interception devices that's

352
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:19,050
that you like official term whatever and

353
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:21,550
then of course previously I shared how

354
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:23,590
motherboard filed a complaint against

355
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:25,600
the Metropolitan Police of like hey

356
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:30,370
you're using this like why are you using

357
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:32,770
this and believe it or not nation-state

358
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:36,610
threat actors so previously I shared the

359
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:39,760
stealth mango lookout report and that

360
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:44,139
was a nation state using stalker where

361
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:49,170
spyware to surveil specific targets and

362
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:54,820
then also too reckless one an apt group

363
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:57,580
so heavier Valdes Cardenas he was known

364
00:19:54,820 --> 00:20:00,490
for investigating drug cartels and so

365
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:05,110
what happened was a few

366
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:07,000
days after his death assassination his

367
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:11,860
colleagues were actually targeted by

368
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:17,770
Pegasus to by a Mexican apt to find out

369
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:20,229
what the heck what's going on so yeah so

370
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:21,100
now we're gonna get into a little bit of

371
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:26,200
tradecraft

372
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:28,600
of the various sectors so this one I'm

373
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:34,360
calling Kimber it's just your typical

374
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:37,270
average you know I guess privacy

375
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:40,209
violator that likes to use shared

376
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:42,160
accounts like shared email accounts that

377
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:46,380
I've Find My Phone

378
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:50,140
dual use apps and they try to

379
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:52,720
unilaterally control and manipulate the

380
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:54,250
situation manipulate friends and family

381
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,880
and of course emotional and

382
00:20:54,250 --> 00:21:03,070
psychological abuse unethical use of

383
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:06,010
social engineering so the next the next

384
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:09,639
flavor of thread actors that like to use

385
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:13,450
this is are the commodity stark aware or

386
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:15,429
spyware abusers and of course with this

387
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:20,020
is included emotional and psychological

388
00:21:15,429 --> 00:21:23,920
abuse as well and then we take it up a

389
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:26,350
step with Electra and Electra likes to

390
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:29,770
use em right they're a little bit more

391
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:35,230
technical they're up to date on social

392
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:38,620
engineering techniques and like you know

393
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:41,530
you know how some how some thread actors

394
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:44,350
they're like really super noisy and

395
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:47,200
you're like wow like they have no skill

396
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:51,300
whatsoever right well these people they

397
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:54,190
know to like be quiet and listen and

398
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:56,678
just wait for the opportune moment to

399
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:59,710
strike or to take what it is that they

400
00:21:56,679 --> 00:22:02,550
want and they also use emotional and

401
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:06,550
psychological abuse as well

402
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:09,639
finally poison Hydra so this one likes

403
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:13,270
to use physical threats slash abuse

404
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,490
slash if you don't do this for me you

405
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:17,000
know

406
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:19,910
love me if you don't do this you can't

407
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,920
see your kids again on and on right on

408
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:27,350
and of course emotional and

409
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:31,970
psychological abuse again so now we're

410
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:36,110
to the CTI hypotheses and the normal use

411
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:39,010
of commodity stocker we're so with this

412
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:42,740
I recommend getting up to speed on

413
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:46,100
what's in your environment so that you

414
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:51,410
can better engage this emerging threat

415
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:53,928
of stalker where which is a common

416
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:57,710
suggestion right the other one is mobile

417
00:22:53,929 --> 00:22:59,960
device management BYOD definitely taking

418
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:02,480
a look at that and what you have going

419
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:05,450
on there's actually a really interesting

420
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,640
report that came out recently and I

421
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:10,059
really want you to listen to what it is

422
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:14,870
that I'm about to say

423
00:23:10,059 --> 00:23:17,629
checkpoint discovered that 75% of a

424
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:20,540
multinational companies mobile devices

425
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:24,320
were infected with an M rat and the way

426
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:26,809
that the apt you know attacker ended up

427
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:30,260
doing that is they compromised their

428
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:33,230
mobile device management server and then

429
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:37,070
what they did is they used that to push

430
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:42,200
out an emirate to all of the orgs mobile

431
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:45,260
devices this is a big deal because when

432
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:49,309
anyone accessed the corporate resources

433
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:53,300
with creds those creds along with the

434
00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:55,399
2fa codes were compromised so at the end

435
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:58,879
of the story the org had to do a factory

436
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:01,370
reset for all mobile devices this is

437
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,790
something that I feel organizations

438
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:08,629
aren't necessarily counting on happening

439
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:11,899
and I'm telling you now be forewarned

440
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:16,700
and be aware that this is possible and

441
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:23,030
to just try to understand your landscape

442
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:25,480
before it happens if it does so the

443
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:26,750
other thing is stock aware vendors right

444
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,840
they

445
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:30,800
turi ously have horrible security

446
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,909
practices

447
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:38,629
I took one just one and I threw them

448
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:42,020
into show Dan and I was like holy crap

449
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:46,700
I mean it's pretty normal you know for

450
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:50,810
small businesses to have a you know RDP

451
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:58,130
and SM be available to anyone on the

452
00:24:50,810 --> 00:25:02,179
internet but yeah it just takes you know

453
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:05,930
one person to decide that they're bored

454
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:08,570
right and the other thing is miss

455
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:11,180
configs they typically a spy phone for

456
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:14,480
instance they had an s3 bucket and API

457
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:19,010
issue kids guard had a msconfig on a

458
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:21,620
server and lost like a ton of data they

459
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:25,010
get breached all the time by hacktivists

460
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:28,610
like hacktivists hate hate stalker where

461
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:29,810
vendors so it's just basically a matter

462
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:33,350
of time

463
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:35,450
sometimes the the transmission of the

464
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:37,580
data is unencrypted you know

465
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:40,940
man-in-the-middle might be possible and

466
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:43,850
also two notable mention the hacking

467
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:47,420
team that sells spyware to governments

468
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:50,959
was hacked and then gamma international

469
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:53,930
was hacked to and documents on thin

470
00:25:50,960 --> 00:26:01,280
fisher a government spy tool was

471
00:25:53,930 --> 00:26:03,830
released so here are some just some of

472
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:07,790
the stock aware vendor breaches ret

473
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:12,139
retina x was breached two times flexi

474
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:14,870
spy mobi stealth spy master pro spy

475
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:19,310
humans by phone hello spy the true spy

476
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:24,800
family orbit mSpy copy 9x nor blog you

477
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:28,280
can read it a lot so this made me think

478
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:31,940
like there are statistics out there

479
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:33,590
based on what domestic violence you know

480
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:36,410
what the what the portion of the

481
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:39,169
population is so what i decided to do

482
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:40,900
was take i don't know let's say a sample

483
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:46,400
size of about

484
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:49,310
20,000 employees right and I split it

485
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:52,460
into 50/50 just cuz let's not get into

486
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:55,220
all that right and so the domestic

487
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:57,670
violence since this is some stock aware

488
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:59,960
is generally directed towards people

489
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:03,500
that are affected by domestic violence

490
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:05,720
the women one out of three women are

491
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,970
impacted by domestic violence and men

492
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:11,570
one out of six

493
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:15,470
so let's let's take those figures right

494
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:18,020
so if fifty fifty percent times twenty

495
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:20,420
thousand times thirty three percent for

496
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:24,760
women that's three give or take three

497
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:33,620
thousand employees right and then men

498
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:36,260
1667 so the other the other statistic is

499
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:38,389
that approximately fifty four percent of

500
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:41,000
domestic violence victims are tracked

501
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:43,240
with stock aware according to the and an

502
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,940
e DV which is a domestic violence

503
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:48,740
organization that helps people so if you

504
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:51,380
take all those numbers and you take all

505
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:53,150
those figures and you multiply it by a

506
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:57,080
point you know

507
00:27:53,150 --> 00:28:01,070
five four that gets thirteen point five

508
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:02,810
percent of your employees were impacted

509
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:09,230
by starka where at one point in their

510
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:11,270
lives give or take so why would we care

511
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:15,350
and it's at some point in their lives

512
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:19,400
right so the reason why this is a big

513
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:22,850
deal is that I'll give you a two brief

514
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:27,110
scenarios so the first one is ransomware

515
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:30,290
actors right so they've kind of shifted

516
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:33,169
their tactics again and let's say you're

517
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:36,050
a big company right and you're a third

518
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:38,600
party vendor that has like higher

519
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:42,379
critical data gets compromised and the

520
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:43,820
ransomware actor is like oh you know we

521
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:45,290
look through the third-party vendors

522
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:49,490
data and we saw that we had really

523
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:52,730
sensitive data or information from big

524
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:54,040
company X over here right let's try to

525
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:58,630
extort them

526
00:28:54,040 --> 00:29:03,120
so how how difficult would it be for

527
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:07,990
these ransomware actors to compromise a

528
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:12,159
stock aware vendor right and sift

529
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:15,370
through all of the data and go after

530
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:17,500
these companies that have sensitive data

531
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:19,679
that wasn't supposed to be leaked in the

532
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:25,360
first place thanks to stock aware and

533
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:28,900
then try to extort them right the other

534
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,879
the other angle to look at is that let's

535
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,800
let's let's take ransomware out of the

536
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,520
picture let's take all of that out of

537
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:37,870
the picture and let's just say that

538
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,879
let's just say that the struck or wonder

539
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:43,449
vendor stark aware vendor is breached

540
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:46,390
right and people recognize or realize

541
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:48,930
that some of the data that is in there

542
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:54,880
is related to your organization and

543
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:57,760
let's say that it it's damaging right or

544
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:00,250
it could serve as additional proof for

545
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:03,760
lawsuits or god knows what so that's

546
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:08,140
also another angle to consider so here

547
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:13,180
are some CTI hypotheses of repurposed

548
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:16,330
piece of stock aware so instead insider

549
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:19,810
threats right they can install hacking

550
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:22,659
tools on personal devices install stock

551
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:25,179
aware and attempt to pivot on to the

552
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:27,820
corporate network through IOT printer or

553
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:31,420
some other weakness the other thing is

554
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:35,260
data X well if I have stock aware on my

555
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:37,990
personal device and I want to get these

556
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:40,450
out you know whatever this document

557
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:43,120
whatever this meeting and I want to get

558
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:46,030
it out of the organization but I can't

559
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:48,040
because a DLP or god knows what right so

560
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:50,920
if I just take stock aware in there and

561
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:52,629
hold my phone up um like that's easy

562
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:55,000
right

563
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:57,640
the other thing is unintentional insider

564
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,220
threats so those are the people that are

565
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:05,350
in domestic violence situations that are

566
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:07,840
just leaking data and not intentionally

567
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:10,540
so it could be non

568
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:13,720
non-intentional to the other thing is

569
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:17,409
executives employ and employees so for

570
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:21,820
instance Jeff Bezos is AI iPhone his

571
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:24,580
iPhone it was a hacked and it gave the

572
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:30,040
attackers access to his photos and text

573
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:33,990
I mean if he can get hacked right so

574
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:37,800
that's something to consider as well

575
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:40,930
competitors competitors can track

576
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:43,629
especially maybe not necessarily in the

577
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:47,320
age of koban but let's say non-coated

578
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:49,450
and they're tracking your CEO or one of

579
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:51,100
the strategic individuals at your

580
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:55,650
organization and who they're meeting

581
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:59,429
with to possibly discern like insider

582
00:31:55,650 --> 00:32:02,050
information insider trading business

583
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:06,640
negotiations all of that so that's

584
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:10,270
something to consider as well the next

585
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:14,050
one industrial espionage I'm not gonna

586
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:16,500
name names here but hopefully this slide

587
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:20,139
is kind of speaks for itself

588
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:24,330
so stalker where or repurpose stock

589
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:28,690
aware gives nation states and other

590
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:33,610
countries and easy in to do whatever

591
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:36,100
they want as well so what are some

592
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:40,389
solutions that corporate America can

593
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:44,830
have right so citizens lab they put out

594
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:48,040
a report a page 37 38 or so and there's

595
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:50,590
some I ox in there that you can use the

596
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:51,639
other thing you know to block and to

597
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:55,240
make sure that they're properly

598
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:56,590
categorized to see if there's traffic in

599
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:59,380
your environment and I'll talk more

600
00:32:56,590 --> 00:33:04,560
about this in a little bit and then also

601
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:08,100
to make sure like or at least encourage

602
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:12,639
employees not to jailbreak their phones

603
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:17,020
not to use WeChat or tik-tok so those

604
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:20,650
are some things to consider another

605
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:23,020
thing you can do are tabletops

606
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:24,910
so you can think about you know let's

607
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:27,550
say you know the average employees

608
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:30,790
walking around or your seaso or someone

609
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:33,610
like that right and you think how can i

610
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:37,139
monetize this data if I was able to

611
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:40,689
steal it so having a tabletop on that

612
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:46,300
you know in the event of poor security

613
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:50,500
practices which will happen of stock or

614
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:53,320
where vendors how and let's say that

615
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:54,970
they have a misconfigured s3 bucket and

616
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:57,220
your data is just sitting up there and

617
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:59,500
you didn't know about it until you know

618
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:02,830
some security Reacher researchers like

619
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:04,510
yo your data is up here and then you try

620
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:06,730
to reach out to the stark aware vendor

621
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:09,340
but like they're not taking takedown

622
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:12,090
requests like what what do you do like

623
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:15,280
how do you escalate in your organization

624
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:18,399
the other thing is previously how we

625
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,380
spoke about ransomware actors like what

626
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:23,168
happens if they try to extort your

627
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:24,970
organization for a third party getting

628
00:34:23,168 --> 00:34:28,000
compromised and them finding they have

629
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:31,330
your sensitive data what do you do and

630
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:37,030
then the other thing is the mobile

631
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:39,940
device management so how how how would

632
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:41,770
an attacker compromise your mobile

633
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:44,168
device management server do you have the

634
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:46,750
server what's your solution do you not

635
00:34:44,168 --> 00:34:51,790
have a solution like what would you do

636
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:55,840
um you know how would you analyze the

637
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:59,920
apks like like how how would you deal

638
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:02,890
with with it if 75% of your mobile

639
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:05,110
devices that had you know your your - if

640
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:10,540
a token and all that other stuff got

641
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:13,750
compromised like think about that so

642
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:16,900
awareness Chris Cox and operations safe

643
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:19,150
escape they have a wonderful thing going

644
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:22,840
on I would definitely check out what

645
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:27,070
they do I have links on here also to

646
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:29,890
stop stock aware org it's a part of EF F

647
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:31,900
and Ava and a bunch of like different

648
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:33,069
companies AV vendors get together and

649
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:36,770
they're like

650
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:38,900
yeah stalker war is bad and we should

651
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:42,110
probably like do something about it so

652
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:45,290
they're doing something about it um some

653
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:48,380
some suggestions is you know never leave

654
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:51,250
your cell phone unattended always delete

655
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:55,310
unused applications apps on your phone

656
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:56,360
regularly search for suspicious apps as

657
00:35:55,310 --> 00:36:00,610
well

658
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:03,110
use a quality password manager and then

659
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:07,570
change your smartphone passcodes

660
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:11,000
regularly don't jailbreak your phone and

661
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:13,520
existing avian spyware tools are kind of

662
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,990
ineffective so don't necessarily rely on

663
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:20,930
that and for Android what you want to do

664
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:23,629
is check the device administrators look

665
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:31,850
make sure that Google Play protect is

666
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:34,880
not not disabled and and and look to to

667
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:38,779
see if install apps from unknown sources

668
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:41,530
is enabled if that's enabled like you

669
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:44,840
cop problems

670
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:48,860
so some resources for corporate America

671
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:50,630
tall poppy dot IO they have a wonderful

672
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:53,350
program that works with corporate

673
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:57,560
America to deal with these specific

674
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:58,910
situations of technological abuse and

675
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:00,980
dealing with stock aware and all of that

676
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:04,160
I'd suggest checking them out safe

677
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:07,790
escape org the National Coalition

678
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:10,460
Against Domestic Violence and n EDB stop

679
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:12,820
stock aware dot org also to Cornell

680
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:15,740
Tech's they have a client centered

681
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:17,980
clinical computer security practice to

682
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:22,509
help people they have a tech

683
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:22,510
consultation questionnaire as well

684
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:28,970
so you know we learned about stock aware

685
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:32,240
we learned about spyware Emre dual use

686
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:35,870
apps basically it's an emerging threat

687
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:38,959
that can impact and has impacted

688
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:42,080
corporate America from CEOs down to

689
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:45,980
employees down to 75% of the mobile

690
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:48,080
devices at an organization so you need

691
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:51,190
to do organization specific threat

692
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:54,049
modeling especially since there's

693
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:59,230
sub-optimal AV detection like you can't

694
00:37:54,050 --> 00:38:01,940
rely on the AV vendors right now or well

695
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:04,670
we won't get into that but definitely do

696
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:13,580
not rely on the AV vendors for stalker

697
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:16,760
where detection like just don't thank

698
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:21,130
you so much but wait there's there's

699
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:21,130
something weird with that slide

700
00:38:34,240 --> 00:39:00,620
technical difficulties hold on one

701
00:38:48,290 --> 00:39:05,180
second oh good okay we got that settled

702
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:10,970
so where were we oh we were gonna talk

703
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:14,930
about reverse engineering uh Android

704
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:17,060
apks okay so let's say let's say on the

705
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:18,980
off chance you know you get something in

706
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:21,200
your organization and you're like crap

707
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:22,820
like I have to learn how to reverse

708
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,160
engineer these like out of the blue

709
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:27,830
because a bunch of people got impacted

710
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:31,759
and we can't upload it to virustotal

711
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:36,799
because well we can't right so what I

712
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:39,170
did I use Chum on X's YouTube videos and

713
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:43,280
explanation where she goes through tools

714
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:45,140
and goes through some general techniques

715
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,750
that you would need to reverse engineer

716
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:50,089
apks so I'm gonna show you the

717
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:52,850
difference between the two so that you

718
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:55,610
can know if I can do it in an evening so

719
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:57,850
can you so don't be scared and you got

720
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:57,850
this

721
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:05,960
so the first one apktool so I use that

722
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:07,880
to decompile the AAP ki apk that I

723
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:11,180
picked I'm not going to name which one

724
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:13,490
and basically on here you can see the

725
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:18,529
various permissions from the Android

726
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:23,450
manifest file that I managed to get and

727
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:26,450
so it describes you know like the

728
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:29,359
different things that I can get so I'm

729
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:35,540
gonna read it here like the call log

730
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:38,060
data SMS I can write and read to

731
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:41,420
external storage like I can check the

732
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:44,840
network state the contacts the camera I

733
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:51,290
can read the calendar okay cool so we

734
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:53,930
got that so in in the decompiled

735
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:57,500
you know APK there was something called

736
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:59,330
classes.dex and i was like i need to

737
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:02,930
read that but i can't read the dex file

738
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:06,700
so what I used I used x2 jar to convert

739
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:11,210
it to a jar file so that I could later

740
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:13,700
read the contents in JD GUI so then as

741
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:17,690
you can see there a highlighted the

742
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:23,149
hard-coded URL that was in that

743
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:25,280
particular apk so now let's say that

744
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:28,190
your org isn't in danger and you just

745
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:31,370
want to dabble and you're curious about

746
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:34,100
what's going on with starka where apks

747
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:36,250
anyways right so here's the quick and

748
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:40,100
easy when you don't necessarily have to

749
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:41,600
be concerned about privacy issues or

750
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:45,560
anything like that so I went to

751
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:46,910
decompiler comm I uploaded the stock

752
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:51,110
aware apk and OH

753
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:54,350
lo and behold there are you know

754
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:56,360
permissions on there almost exactly it's

755
00:41:54,350 --> 00:42:01,220
exactly the same that I got from

756
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:04,250
manually doing it so next I uploaded

757
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:07,879
that particular sample to virustotal it

758
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:12,090
hit it got hit by eleven out of 61

759
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:17,490
engines still not a very good

760
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:20,100
um yeah so then what I did is I looked

761
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:21,359
at the permissions so it gives you the

762
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:23,790
permission so you don't have to

763
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:25,590
decompile it all of that you get that

764
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:29,330
information right there and then it also

765
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:32,880
gave me the interesting strings so that

766
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:33,390
was also very helpful and just for

767
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,810
giggles

768
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:41,700
I threw it into hybrid analysis and I

769
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:44,340
got the TTP's so if you let's say you

770
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:45,870
don't have to manually assign the TPS

771
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:46,680
right you just want to know for the hell

772
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:49,620
of it

773
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:53,580
it does that for you so you can throw

774
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:54,779
the sample up there and just for fun I

775
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:57,840
started doing

776
00:42:54,780 --> 00:43:00,300
deidre and using that to reverse

777
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:02,480
engineer too but then I was like well I

778
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:05,250
don't you have all the data I need and

779
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:09,240
like I have other projects I needed to

780
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:10,620
work on so I it's tons of fun and it's

781
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:12,959
definitely something that I'll come back

782
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:18,900
to and learn how to do in giedrius as

783
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:25,710
well so now we are going to pivot and

784
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:28,470
look at ascent and other stuff so I took

785
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:31,320
what I had right I had the eye ox and

786
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:34,589
information from citizens lab and a lot

787
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:38,640
of that data was pulled in 2018 as we

788
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:42,890
all know I ox can get old allegedly so I

789
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:45,480
started there and as we go along this I

790
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:47,730
started creating a list and putting all

791
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:52,650
the stuff I found in the list which I'm

792
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:55,320
sharing with all of you later so I threw

793
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:56,430
a random you know email I threw them all

794
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:59,700
into virustotal

795
00:43:56,430 --> 00:44:02,129
and then I went to the files that were

796
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:05,520
related to that as well and you can see

797
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:07,560
that I highlighted it there and then I

798
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:10,290
clicked on it and I was like oh look

799
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:12,390
another domain of something thats

800
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:14,960
related to stock aware right so I

801
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:17,609
included that on the list as well and

802
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:19,950
then the next phase was going through

803
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:22,170
each and every single stock aware vendor

804
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:24,299
that was breached and seeing what I

805
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:26,990
could find on buyers total that was

806
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:30,450
related

807
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:32,609
and then I don't know if you've been on

808
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:35,700
Twitter lately but there was a big you

809
00:44:32,609 --> 00:44:36,869
know InfoSec Twitter was like how dare

810
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:42,660
you

811
00:44:36,869 --> 00:44:44,910
this one publishing company article and

812
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:46,950
it had to do with spying on your wife so

813
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:49,529
I was like okay I'll use that as a

814
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:51,810
google search and see what comes up so I

815
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:53,760
went through item by item by item and

816
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:55,140
pulled out the relevant information and

817
00:44:53,760 --> 00:45:00,720
searched embarrassed total and then

818
00:44:55,140 --> 00:45:04,740
added it to a list next step Google Play

819
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:08,009
Store so I typed in like a name of like

820
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:10,740
a popular popular spyware and then a

821
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:13,740
bunch of options popped up so I just

822
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:16,259
clicked on various options and I looked

823
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:18,868
for websites that were related to the

824
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:22,859
developer went there and then pivoted

825
00:45:18,869 --> 00:45:25,380
off of that the other thing is SSL certs

826
00:45:22,859 --> 00:45:27,900
in this one I typed in flexi spy and got

827
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:30,710
two additional domains and so

828
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:34,050
interestingly enough these two domains

829
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:37,859
they more or less gave a rundown of like

830
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:39,930
what the various stores did what you get

831
00:45:37,859 --> 00:45:43,380
for your money like why you want to use

832
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:46,500
one over another all of that so I added

833
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:51,810
those domains to lists just cuz like

834
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:56,880
yeah but next I looked at the security

835
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:59,220
researchers so Anna screw tables he has

836
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,380
an awesome github page with a ton of

837
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:03,810
information he's given talks on this

838
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:06,089
subject like she's super passionate

839
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:09,180
about it I highly recommend checking him

840
00:46:06,089 --> 00:46:13,470
out if you get a chance he knows his

841
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:16,618
stuff and he'll said I oxen there that I

842
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:19,819
that I updated and searched and added

843
00:46:16,619 --> 00:46:22,980
and then made him the contributor

844
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:26,430
contributor for those and here's another

845
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:30,930
one I I used the hashtag stalker where

846
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:32,970
and apk and amazingly and his crew

847
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:37,230
tables popped up with like detailed

848
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:38,029
information of like you know stalker

849
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:39,980
where's so

850
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:44,150
I added whatever iooks I can pull out of

851
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:48,230
that to the list as well another search

852
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:50,570
that I did a malware hunter team goes

853
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:53,780
without speaking right they're freaking

854
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:57,290
awesome so I entered that and then apk

855
00:46:53,780 --> 00:47:00,470
into Twitter and bam like a huge you

856
00:46:57,290 --> 00:47:03,350
just keep scrolling and in in in the

857
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:05,649
post they go like not very good

858
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:08,810
detection like warning warning warning

859
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:11,450
so I pulled some of those i aux out and

860
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:14,540
added it to the list and then provided

861
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:18,620
proper attribution to them the other

862
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:20,720
thing so with all of these URLs just to

863
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:23,900
you know keep things neutral or whatever

864
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:25,939
I went to Lenny's alters website and on

865
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:27,980
there he has like a long list of like

866
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:30,740
how to look up malicious websites right

867
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:32,710
so I picked two you randomly I'm not

868
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:36,049
beating up on anyone I didn't single

869
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:38,570
whatever blah right so the first one I

870
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:41,660
tried was bright cloud and it was the

871
00:47:38,570 --> 00:47:45,920
true spy com it was like a really big

872
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:47,750
stock aware name where like if you know

873
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:51,470
anything about stock aware like that

874
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:53,150
one's kind of popular so with that one I

875
00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:57,259
threw that in there and it came back as

876
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:59,600
malicious and hacking and keylogger and

877
00:47:57,260 --> 00:48:03,170
then I was like huh well that's good

878
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:08,270
news right but then I threw the same the

879
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:14,120
same domain into IBM X horse and it came

880
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:17,570
back as education and health so after

881
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:20,870
after this talk I'm gonna go and suggest

882
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:23,270
an edit on that one so just think about

883
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:28,220
your proxy and what's going on at your

884
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:30,920
organization you know are your employees

885
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:33,169
allowed to shop for stalker where well

886
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:38,570
on company time and on your company

887
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:40,580
device things like that so there was a

888
00:48:38,570 --> 00:48:43,070
lot of information in here and a lot of

889
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:46,430
research went into this talk so what I

890
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:49,490
did is I created a website it'll be

891
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:51,629
tweeting out I think now ish from my

892
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:55,799
account and

893
00:48:51,630 --> 00:49:00,780
it's sites.google.com / view / stalker

894
00:48:55,800 --> 00:49:03,030
where and on there I have a takeaway

895
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:07,640
section where I did a threat summary

896
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:11,120
report for y'all to include in your

897
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:13,680
threat intelligence platform or to

898
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:16,890
copy/paste and do whatever you want with

899
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:19,919
it and then I also have the indicators

900
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:25,379
of compromised as well and then I also

901
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:28,350
have a form of submission of you know

902
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:30,330
give me your stock aware iooks so that

903
00:49:28,350 --> 00:49:34,020
we can add them to the list if you feel

904
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:36,540
like it and then I have a contact me

905
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:42,140
page as well and I included two videos

906
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:46,259
so the first one is from EB C and they a

907
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:49,410
lady reporter is given a phone to watch

908
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:53,520
her male colleague for I think it was 2

909
00:49:49,410 --> 00:49:56,370
days so you get to see like when I said

910
00:49:53,520 --> 00:50:00,000
I was surveilled give or take for about

911
00:49:56,370 --> 00:50:02,490
for two years like you get to see in two

912
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,470
days what I lived with for almost two

913
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:08,250
years and it gives you a good

914
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:10,430
perspective of what employees you know

915
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:14,300
what your employees might go through

916
00:50:10,430 --> 00:50:18,290
people in domestic violence situations

917
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:20,970
how it can be used against your

918
00:50:18,290 --> 00:50:24,300
organization so definitely check that

919
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:28,140
out and then also - for just a general

920
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:29,880
overview stop stalker where the

921
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:31,500
coalition against stalker where they did

922
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:33,570
a really good video that was released

923
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:34,110
recently so I also linked that on the

924
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:37,440
page

925
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:40,500
and if you hate Google Sites I also

926
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:43,020
created a github as well specifically

927
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:46,140
for this where it uploaded the I ox in a

928
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:51,300
CSV format so you can easily get the

929
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:55,319
data without having to use a try to get

930
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:57,630
it from a PDF right and then also the

931
00:50:55,320 --> 00:51:03,720
threat summary report so it's at github

932
00:50:57,630 --> 00:51:06,650
calm /ch 3-3 r10 forward slash stalker
