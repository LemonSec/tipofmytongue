1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:06,539
please welcome lawyer Johnson and their

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:11,099
talk on cyber harassment things I wish I

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,570
knew before [ __ ] went sideways hi

4
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:15,690
everybody good afternoon

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:18,359
so this talk stemmed from which I'm sure

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,590
those talks I'm from sitting outside of

7
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,720
a conference saying I wonder if this

8
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,670
would be a good idea so I do have a side

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,279
note on my first slide I to thank those

10
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:30,510
that were there and really helped me get

11
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:31,880
the strength to do this so I am just the

12
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,190
same as everybody else

13
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:38,850
however I got lucky enough to receive

14
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:42,360
giant manifesto emails and within those

15
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:46,129
emails it took me to one heck of a dark

16
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:49,440
place and I decided to start researching

17
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:51,360
recently on kind of what other people

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,309
were experiencing with this and what

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,829
laws wrapped around and where you could

20
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:58,349
get protected from it because as I went

21
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:00,899
through my experience I was one of the

22
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:04,949
first for my lawyer so that led me to

23
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:06,540
the trolly moment in my life because to

24
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:09,270
give this talk there is a possibility

25
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,189
that individuals will figure out who I

26
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,949
had to get a protection we were against

27
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:16,439
and I had to say to myself what's worse

28
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:19,290
not speaking out about this and then

29
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:21,899
having the whole next generation have

30
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,700
harassment problems and feel helpless or

31
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,340
do I go ahead and speak out about my

32
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,960
experience and try to help others not

33
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,030
end up in the same scenario I was then

34
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,419
so in reality I'm not controlling the

35
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,060
trolly

36
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,130
I am laying on one of those tracks with

37
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,900
the other individual possibly getting

38
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:40,229
ready to run over from the amount of

39
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:42,869
backlash I might receive from doing so

40
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:43,229
who I am NOT I am definitely not a

41
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:47,280
lawyer

42
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:49,369
and trust me mine was very expensive

43
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,290
hopefully this talk will help you save

44
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:54,479
some money in the future if you do run

45
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,610
into the situation and I also want to

46
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,810
say I am very much that therapist I had

47
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:03,390
to hire a close one as well so

48
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:05,399
harassment in general is been the

49
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,009
weirdest thing to research it is all

50
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,989
individual based on how you feel and

51
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:12,120
during my experience one of the things

52
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,660
that my lawyer made sure I understood

53
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,670
the poise at the end of the day

54
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,650
you walk into a courtroom it's just

55
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:20,619
strangers it's strangers that are gonna

56
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:23,590
judge you obviously on what facts you

57
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:26,890
brought to the table and harassment laws

58
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:29,970
when you read them are not exactly

59
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:33,850
caught up with where we are online today

60
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:35,800
and then there's the lovely argument

61
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:38,680
when people start harassing you that

62
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,780
they have a right to do so and when you

63
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,630
go around and start googling what is

64
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:46,090
really the definition you're gonna get

65
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:49,359
opinions well I have plenty of opinions

66
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:52,300
that I don't have the right to hurt

67
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:56,770
somebody to share so well obviously that

68
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:58,660
turns into quite a gray area and in that

69
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:00,160
gray area when you start really reading

70
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:03,070
into it the only thing that I could

71
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,170
truly find that came down to it was

72
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:07,079
putting somebody else at harm for

73
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:09,190
instance the fire in a crowded theatre

74
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:14,980
but at the end of the day who decides

75
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:18,370
what that harm is and the cyber

76
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:21,310
definition so a lot of people especially

77
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:24,130
when I was seeking legal advice or legal

78
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:26,200
counsel and irony to my experience was

79
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:28,180
that I was going through a situation

80
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,339
that is a very normal situation for most

81
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,930
individuals and it was my lawyer who

82
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,400
brought up that I had gotten out of

83
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,680
control that I had gotten to the point

84
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,740
of stalking and harassment and that I

85
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,930
needed to really reach out and start

86
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:44,050
looking at protective orders in order to

87
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:45,550
protect myself and my child I had no

88
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,780
idea at that time that that was even

89
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:50,410
available and to be honest with you

90
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:53,430
neither did my attorney because the

91
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:55,570
lawyer doesn't really do a lot of

92
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:59,500
continuing education like we do with

93
00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:02,829
certifications or conferences for my

94
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:05,020
understanding when you get you know your

95
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:07,060
legal degree and you go through and you

96
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,380
take your bar you can continue on your

97
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,360
education on your own but at the end of

98
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,799
the day you do have your bar so as far

99
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,720
as the harassment laws that have

100
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:17,140
recently kind of come to light and

101
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,899
changed and looked in a different way of

102
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:22,810
how we're handling these types of

103
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:24,520
situations then you get into this area

104
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:27,360
where you really have to start doing

105
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:30,150
your own digging on what those laws

106
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,620
me and what they mean to you and the

107
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,659
other part that a lot of people fall

108
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,460
into is they start responding to these

109
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:38,310
attackers in the same attacking manner

110
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:42,060
in the same way and trust me in the very

111
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:44,939
beginning I wanted to I did I made

112
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:46,740
plenty of mistakes of apologizing and

113
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:49,199
trying to take ownership just to make

114
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:50,969
the harassment stop and at the end of

115
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,919
the day if you're going into court

116
00:04:50,969 --> 00:04:56,159
understand that every single thing that

117
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:58,590
you say back is evidence - so the last

118
00:04:56,159 --> 00:05:00,659
thing you want to do is be sitting there

119
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:03,299
you know with someone who has harassed

120
00:05:00,659 --> 00:05:09,090
you and you've become the harasser as

121
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:11,849
well and I don't want to go too deep

122
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:14,460
into how to enable a harasser obviously

123
00:05:11,849 --> 00:05:17,430
form anyway since nobody needs to learn

124
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:20,870
how to get around laws or how to get

125
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:24,180
around ways to hurt somebody but

126
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:28,020
obviously we were all aware of the many

127
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:29,669
many ways that you can hide and hiding

128
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,799
behind a screen seems to be much more

129
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:34,109
easier nowadays for individuals to

130
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,839
become you know as they call bully or a

131
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:45,599
stalker or harasser then you know being

132
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:50,759
in person so when I put together my

133
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:53,069
emails my texts and I sat down with the

134
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,139
lawyer and he said I want you to be

135
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:58,289
prepared but there is a large

136
00:05:55,139 --> 00:06:00,389
possibility that I was wrong you're

137
00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:02,729
going to lose and that we really don't

138
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:04,110
have a leg to stand on and through this

139
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:07,680
whole process I was prepared for that

140
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:09,539
and I was prepared to just block emails

141
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,879
and kind of continue on with my life

142
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:14,310
that way and not have to deal with it

143
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:16,860
anymore and kind of just spend hours on

144
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:19,319
end having to look on to make sure my

145
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:21,270
name wasn't put up on a website or that

146
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:24,479
a fake website was launched about me or

147
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:26,549
that individuals put up information on

148
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:30,419
Twitter or Facebook you know I can go on

149
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:32,909
for hours and I was really mentally

150
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:37,169
ready for that what I was never ready

151
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:39,450
for was at the end of the session in the

152
00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:41,370
courtroom they

153
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:43,620
and I know reading your slides it's not

154
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:45,600
the greatest thing they read to me this

155
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:47,430
is more than a subtle approach but

156
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,470
nonetheless it is sufficient to

157
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:51,990
establish that miss Johnson is an

158
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:54,450
imminent danger as mr. harasser simply

159
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:57,180
cannot let go and uses these methods of

160
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:59,370
coercion manipulation and control to

161
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:02,820
maintain contact and some sort of

162
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:05,130
authority over miss Johnson I will admit

163
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:07,380
at that point I did cry because I never

164
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:09,810
through this entire process and this

165
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:11,790
entire experience thought that anybody

166
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:13,670
believes me believes what I felt I

167
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:16,650
didn't believe that I was valid I

168
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:21,900
honestly just thought to myself I'm

169
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:25,710
being too sensitive so what works for me

170
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:28,440
to get through that was taking these

171
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:31,169
emails these texts these screenshots and

172
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:33,660
never reading them again sending them my

173
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:35,100
attorney at the end of it I'm just

174
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:38,160
creating it forward so that my attorney

175
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:40,620
could read them and my attorney let me

176
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,380
know anything that was relevant to my

177
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:46,520
safety but other than that making sure

178
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:49,050
that I didn't spend time rereading

179
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:52,409
somebody else's opinion of me or

180
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:55,170
somebody else's words that they believed

181
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:57,230
were to be factual because at the end of

182
00:07:55,170 --> 00:08:00,030
the day that was just destroying me and

183
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:03,900
when I walked into a courtroom one of

184
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:07,349
the things that I really had to practice

185
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:08,760
was just stating facts because people

186
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:10,740
weren't hearing me when I was emotional

187
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:13,950
they weren't hearing me if I was in

188
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:16,560
tears and but when I stated the facts

189
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:18,900
that I was hurt one of the biggest

190
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,050
surprises during this experience was

191
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:24,299
filing for FMLA I had to take a

192
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:27,720
significant time off of work for court

193
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:30,210
hearings and for just going to my

194
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,710
therapist and I was concerned that I was

195
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:34,770
taking so much time off work that I was

196
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:36,419
going to lose my job and it came to my

197
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:38,850
attention that I could apply for FMLA

198
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:40,260
because when I thought about this I

199
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:43,050
thought it was just for if you have a

200
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,700
child or an adoption or something going

201
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:46,740
on in your family I never thought that I

202
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:50,280
could apply for it for trauma counseling

203
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,990
and I highly suggest that if anybody is

204
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,589
in that position the last thing anyone

205
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,680
needs

206
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:57,090
like in my experience is another anxiety

207
00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:00,959
saying to yourself what if I lose my job

208
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:04,910
and the other part that was an

209
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:07,770
interesting situation for me was really

210
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:10,140
being able to validate myself and how I

211
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:12,720
felt and then being able to talk to

212
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:14,670
other people and also being able to walk

213
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,250
away from people who were thinking I was

214
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:19,290
just being dramatic being able to say to

215
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:22,710
myself no I am I am correct this is

216
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:25,170
valid this is how I feel and I have a

217
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:27,360
right not to be harassed and one of the

218
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:30,060
links that I'm gonna share throughout my

219
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,250
slide deck multiple times I think it's

220
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:35,640
very important as a foundation I found

221
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:38,670
when doing my research really has posted

222
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:41,370
up every law available for cyberbullying

223
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:42,810
and if anybody is in that position I

224
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:45,000
highly suggest going through and read

225
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:46,229
them they are state to state and it very

226
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
much helps when you're trying to look

227
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:49,890
for a lawyer or you're trying to look

228
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:56,490
for what help you can get on a legal

229
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:58,080
side so the trauma of it was one of the

230
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:01,050
hardest things to admit because no one

231
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,700
wants to say you know I I'm in trouble

232
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,750
well I didn't have a problem saying I

233
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,090
was in trauma counseling to be honest

234
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:07,620
with you with the mental abuse if

235
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:10,740
someone punches in his face it's

236
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:14,040
incredibly easy to walk away but the

237
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:16,440
constant emails or texts or manifesto

238
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:18,180
style emails that I kid you not or you

239
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:21,930
know five pages long or three pages long

240
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:24,589
and you sit there and you read them and

241
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:26,250
you start to believe it at least I did I

242
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:27,540
can only speak from my own experience

243
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:31,620
but I started to believe what I was

244
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:34,740
reading and I started losing who I

245
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:37,350
really am and then the fear took over as

246
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,820
well because the emails got worse the

247
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:41,970
you know if I don't comply with things

248
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:44,070
if I don't do things that are within the

249
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:49,670
lines of what this individual wants me

250
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:53,400
to do then I get quotes like these and

251
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:55,110
the difficult part is you know being in

252
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:59,010
this field I understand the

253
00:10:55,110 --> 00:11:02,610
possibilities for troops and one of

254
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:04,410
those that you know again as I'd like to

255
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:06,329
read it as much as she deserves to have

256
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:08,910
the FBI ambushed her at work

257
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:11,269
similar to what you did to me with the

258
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:13,230
protection order I simply cannot justify

259
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:15,480
causing that level of damage without

260
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:18,480
warning however if you choose to ignore

261
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:20,579
this as you've done with everything up

262
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,339
until this point I don't see what other

263
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:25,138
options I have so when reading this now

264
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:26,939
I'm afraid to go to work I'm afraid to

265
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:29,549
sit down in my office where everybody

266
00:11:26,939 --> 00:11:31,969
thinks that I'm just a regular old mom

267
00:11:29,549 --> 00:11:34,739
who goes into work and goes home and

268
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:37,410
what if what if I now have the entire

269
00:11:34,739 --> 00:11:38,749
FBI ambush my work you know even though

270
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:41,219
I don't think this is a possibility

271
00:11:38,749 --> 00:11:42,480
reading it over and over I started

272
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,480
thinking that it was and I started

273
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:48,809
getting afraid to even to my office desk

274
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,579
or when I started moving to ensure that

275
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:54,029
now I don't have to worry about someone

276
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:55,769
coming to my home then I get the message

277
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:56,910
of you seem to forget that I work in

278
00:11:55,769 --> 00:11:59,189
information security and intelligence

279
00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:00,719
and it would likely take me minutes to

280
00:11:59,189 --> 00:12:03,988
find out anything I could possibly want

281
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,299
to know and now I get the extra hand and

282
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:08,429
anxiety of no matter where I go no

283
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:11,100
matter what I do if I lose my debit card

284
00:12:08,429 --> 00:12:12,809
and I have to register for a new one to

285
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:16,009
an address that I live in is this

286
00:12:12,809 --> 00:12:16,009
individual going to find me

287
00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:28,079
so the keeping yourself safe and again

288
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:28,079
I'm not a police officer and a lawyer

289
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:34,059
the American justice system it can work

290
00:12:31,629 --> 00:12:36,910
I know people had it failed that many

291
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:38,980
times it can work and I have found that

292
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:41,439
it works best for me when doing my own

293
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:43,600
research when finding what the laws were

294
00:12:41,439 --> 00:12:46,929
when finding where my evidence fit into

295
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:50,619
those laws and the protective order that

296
00:12:46,929 --> 00:12:52,809
I was able to obtain did keep me safe in

297
00:12:50,619 --> 00:12:55,359
a way of if it was violated then I know

298
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:56,559
that there are consequences to that now

299
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:58,149
at the end of the day if someone you

300
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:59,199
know shows into your home or sent to

301
00:12:58,149 --> 00:13:00,759
another email or launched so their

302
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:03,399
website yes it is just piece of paper in

303
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:05,049
your hands but it is something that can

304
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:07,959
keep you safe for the fact that

305
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:10,449
sometimes that fear for that other

306
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:12,248
individual of the repercussions for

307
00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:15,118
doing whatever they want to do after

308
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:17,919
that is scary enough to make them stop I

309
00:13:15,119 --> 00:13:20,730
joined a lot of support groups I know

310
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:23,589
there's one on this conference chatroom

311
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:24,910
again with the FMLA I highly suggest if

312
00:13:23,589 --> 00:13:27,249
you are in counseling if you need

313
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:30,219
counseling you know look into you

314
00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:33,100
getting that and one of the things that

315
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:35,300
took a lot out of me was not blocking

316
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,769
everything

317
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:40,040
till I had all the evidence I needed

318
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:43,640
however if you do have an attorney

319
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:45,380
I suggest sending the emails to them and

320
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,459
you never have to read them it's not

321
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:49,970
something that you should want to read

322
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:51,920
it's it just breaks you down mentally if

323
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:58,250
you continue to read these messages or

324
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:59,599
you continue to you know play into it so

325
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:03,970
knowing your rights is probably one of

326
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:07,310
the hardest things in this situation

327
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:10,070
when I looked into contacting different

328
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:12,290
attorneys just to get ideas about where

329
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:14,750
we were at with this talk where we were

330
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:16,939
in the world for these laws where you

331
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:18,320
were for your rights I got a lot of

332
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:23,029
different answers from different

333
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:25,370
attorneys and one of the big things that

334
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:29,060
when I was doing this research and I

335
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:31,399
found the foundation was the kids all of

336
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:33,079
these kids and these students that are

337
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:34,610
reporting this massive amount of

338
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:37,910
cyberbullying and the effect it has on

339
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:40,070
their lives and the effect of feeling

340
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:44,810
incredibly helpless even as the parents

341
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:46,940
I spoke to one set of parents that you

342
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:48,589
know they're they don't want me to

343
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:51,440
mention names because they are still in

344
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:53,420
mourning but they lost their child to

345
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,390
suicide over cyberbullying because their

346
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:57,829
child felt as if it just never ended

347
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:59,510
they went to school and got bullied in

348
00:14:57,829 --> 00:15:01,279
person they go home they log into any

349
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:03,079
device I just continued and it just

350
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,850
continued at the end of the day not a

351
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:08,449
single person was held accountable for

352
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:11,420
what happened because the laws didn't do

353
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:13,600
what they should do and I have no idea

354
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,599
why

355
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:28,339
so one of the things that I can say I

356
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:32,869
definitely did wrong was I fell into all

357
00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:35,000
of the statistics all of them and it was

358
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:37,610
very difficult to kind of pull myself

359
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,970
out of that to really look at why that

360
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:42,410
happened and one of the things that kind

361
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:45,620
of got me there was really doing this

362
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:47,870
research on the next generation I mean

363
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:50,209
because my child is online playing video

364
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:51,709
games and he does get his feelings hurt

365
00:15:50,209 --> 00:15:54,050
very often and so I started really

366
00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:57,258
really diving in to these statistics

367
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:59,420
and it was terrifying one of the things

368
00:15:57,259 --> 00:16:02,000
that I found was that 18 percent of

369
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:03,589
youth from cyberbullying but had been

370
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,480
cyber bullied have reported self harming

371
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:09,949
at least once and 6% of the 18 reported

372
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,810
that they were also digitally harming

373
00:16:09,949 --> 00:16:14,060
themselves at that point that they were

374
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:17,589
self sabotaging online and posing

375
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:20,979
harmful content of themselves even

376
00:16:17,589 --> 00:16:24,889
scarier when you know I fell into this

377
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:26,389
moment of things I did wrong as I

378
00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:28,939
started looking at the suicide rate of

379
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:32,340
really over the last year's when

380
00:16:28,939 --> 00:16:33,860
everybody's lives became online

381
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:36,840
how has that really affected that and

382
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:40,020
looking at the statistics they had

383
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:41,910
suicide then listed as the second

384
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:46,000
leading cause and death for those among

385
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:48,069
10 234 and 2017

386
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,640
and from 2017 until now people's lives

387
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:53,020
are even more online so I can't imagine

388
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:55,900
how much that's changed in between that

389
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:59,290
time and the suicide attempts among

390
00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:00,760
adolescents had doubled since 2008 and I

391
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:03,010
know when I was a child that most I had

392
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:05,680
was my you know green screen

393
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:07,420
old school actual floppy disks and I was

394
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,420
not talking to anybody online and I

395
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:11,530
already had a hard enough time in school

396
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:13,689
and now you're getting these kids who

397
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,310
just it's endless the cyberbullying the

398
00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:17,970
harassment is endless and they don't

399
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,970
know what to do

400
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:23,599
and so with that too the problem is the

401
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:25,188
biggest thing I did wrong was my defense

402
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,980
mechanism which I had to work out for a

403
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:29,899
long time to stop doing was to make the

404
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:32,179
harassment stop I started trying to

405
00:17:29,899 --> 00:17:35,029
apologize saying you know what you're

406
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:37,850
absolutely right I am so sorry how do I

407
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:39,799
fix this how do I fix this and that took

408
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:42,408
an amazingly huge toll on me just as an

409
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:43,879
individual and a person because I never

410
00:17:42,409 --> 00:17:47,320
got to stand up for myself because I

411
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,320
didn't know how I didn't know what to do

412
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:55,490
so the things I did right well I have

413
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:58,700
been accused of being obnoxiously happy

414
00:17:55,490 --> 00:18:01,360
and I took that life back i sat down and

415
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:03,620
really realized that I have to stop

416
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,840
treating other people's problems as my

417
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:09,139
own and I have to stop taking ownership

418
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:11,030
for other people's opinions of me and I

419
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:14,270
really had to sit down and look at the

420
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:17,510
facts and I also had to really decide

421
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:19,730
how I want to deal with the abusers

422
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:23,270
align how do I want to handle this in my

423
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:24,740
own self and for my own self I actually

424
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:26,470
started sticking up for myself which is

425
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:28,910
a huge change up still not used to it

426
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:30,380
but I stick up for myself in a way where

427
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:32,930
there's a possibility that I don't say

428
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:35,960
anything at all or I just say please

429
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:38,030
stop sending me news messages

430
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,980
one of the things that I really noticed

431
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:41,780
was that the individual that was

432
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:44,150
harassing me really created their own

433
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:46,730
dumpster fire and just kept throwing

434
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:48,590
gasoline on it and the moment that I

435
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:51,820
walked away and said you know what this

436
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:54,639
isn't about me this is not a me problem

437
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:57,220
and I want more than anything to help

438
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,170
anybody out that's hurting but at the

439
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:01,180
end the day I have to do my own homework

440
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:03,610
and help myself first before I can help

441
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:05,200
anybody else and so I needed to recover

442
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:09,149
from everything that had happened in

443
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:11,470
order to kind of be in that place and

444
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:13,030
one of the things that I learned from

445
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:14,680
that too is really kind of keep an eye

446
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:17,710
on my friends and what's going on with

447
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:19,240
them online or my child because if you

448
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:21,370
start notice somebody being jumpy around

449
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:24,010
getting a text message or you start

450
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:26,830
noticing that somebody is you know kind

451
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:28,330
of backing off online or leaving chat

452
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:30,490
rooms you know asking them if they're

453
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:31,689
okay is one of the things that I really

454
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:35,110
started doing right during all this

455
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:37,090
because I had people doing that for me I

456
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:38,770
didn't see it at the time because I was

457
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:40,780
so buried and everything that was going

458
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:42,520
on but I did have people doing that for

459
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,740
me and I want to make sure I continue to

460
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,270
do that for everybody else

461
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:48,670
the other thing is staying in with the

462
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:52,550
trauma counselor it was really important

463
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:56,000
to do that and it's really important too

464
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:57,560
I feel to promote my own self healing

465
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
through this process to make sure people

466
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,409
are not embarrassed that they have to go

467
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,630
to a therapist I've heard that too many

468
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:04,160
times to this process as I going to

469
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:08,920
therapy is embarrassing when it is not

470
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:11,900
helping heal and get yourself through

471
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:18,230
this type of situation is something that

472
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:22,310
you should be proud of one of the other

473
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:25,630
things that I was very surprised was

474
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:25,629
reading all of the laws and

475
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:33,540
they do them state-by-state and when I

476
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:35,280
looked at Novartis for instance they

477
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:37,830
just have bullying means a will for act

478
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,870
harassment means it will crack and

479
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:41,159
you're looking at that saying yourself

480
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:42,449
what does this really mean and that's

481
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,600
where you start doing the right thing of

482
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:48,090
digging into what it really means you

483
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,730
look at Arkansas who says a person

484
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:52,590
commits the offense of cyberbullying he

485
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:54,210
or she transmits tons or posts

486
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:56,370
communication by electronic means with

487
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:58,470
the purpose to frighten intimidate or

488
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:59,969
threaten or abuse or harassed all these

489
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:02,730
laws when I started really looking at

490
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:05,730
them they're there they're there for you

491
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:09,360
to use and one of the problems with it

492
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:11,600
is do the attorneys know do the judges

493
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:16,350
know do we have to do our own legwork do

494
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:17,699
do you have to really sit down with your

495
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:20,879
attorney and say you know I found these

496
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:23,220
I did that's what I had to do I found

497
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,000
these rules and you know where do these

498
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:27,290
work for me

499
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,290
where where can these help me

500
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:43,419
the things that I still wish I knew man

501
00:21:39,429 --> 00:21:45,340
I could go on this one forever but when

502
00:21:43,419 --> 00:21:48,159
all these lies really catch up and be

503
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:50,168
clear because when I was going through

504
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,480
my experience when I was looking through

505
00:21:50,169 --> 00:21:54,639
all of these laws when I was talking to

506
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,289
individuals about how could hey how can

507
00:21:54,639 --> 00:21:57,340
I get through this even after the

508
00:21:56,289 --> 00:21:59,590
protection order how can I get through

509
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:01,029
this I had multiple people tell me that

510
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:03,100
I wasn't being harassed because I didn't

511
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:05,740
have somebody in my lawn or I didn't

512
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:11,110
have somebody at my workplace I didn't

513
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:14,080
have somebody in my face and it really

514
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:15,939
you know started to get to me of but

515
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,809
there are clear laws there are clear

516
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:22,240
rules written but they're just not being

517
00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:24,190
seen in a courtroom and they're not

518
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:29,769
being seen by these lawyers and they're

519
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:31,629
not being seen by the judges and the

520
00:22:29,769 --> 00:22:33,850
more and more that I dig into this and

521
00:22:31,629 --> 00:22:35,980
I'll continue to dig into this I want to

522
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:38,879
figure out a way to make it so these

523
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:40,990
parents know that they do have a voice

524
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:43,840
that the parents that I spoke to that

525
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:47,320
lost their child over harassment that

526
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:50,110
was constant do have a valid case

527
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:52,178
against somebody else but it's not okay

528
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:54,418
and then you don't have to put up with

529
00:22:52,179 --> 00:22:54,419
it

530
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:58,969
and what was surprising when I talked to

531
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:01,250
you a few lawyers when putting this

532
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:03,650
together is the amount of harassment

533
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:05,630
that they have to put up with in their

534
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:08,330
words have to put up with but they

535
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:10,460
shouldn't have to divorce attorneys for

536
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:13,340
instance get constant constant mail

537
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:17,240
constant emails that are harassing and

538
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:19,730
threatening and just awful and they feel

539
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:22,100
they can't do anything about it because

540
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:23,780
that's their job but it shouldn't be

541
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,310
anybody's job to have somebody's

542
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:27,200
threatening them for them to be

543
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:29,419
concerned that they took on a case like

544
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,980
you know just a normal divorce and now

545
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:32,210
they're worried about their children or

546
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:34,790
they're worried about somebody pulling

547
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:37,730
up into their driveway who is you know

548
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:40,820
their opposing case and that shouldn't

549
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:42,769
be the way that life goes

550
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:44,600
it's also terrifying when I started

551
00:23:42,769 --> 00:23:46,009
looking into websites going how much

552
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:50,870
could I really found out about my stuff

553
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:52,639
online well for you know $5.99 you can

554
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:55,639
find out every cellphone number you've

555
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:57,289
ever had every address you've ever lived

556
00:23:55,639 --> 00:24:00,860
at every place you've ever worked at

557
00:23:57,289 --> 00:24:03,559
everyone you're affiliated with how is

558
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:05,860
this a thing without laws wrapped around

559
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:05,860
them

560
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:12,040
and so that leads into who can really

561
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:14,500
start these changes who can do these

562
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:15,970
changes and I'm going to continue to

563
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,770
reach out and I really hope that people

564
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:19,510
continue to reach out to me so that we

565
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:23,110
can figure that out so we can try to

566
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:25,540
help you know everybody who is really

567
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:27,310
feeling this way get to the other side

568
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:29,920
of this without feeling like they're

569
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:32,730
lost or broken or helpless and that they

570
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,730
can't do anything

571
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:41,070
you

572
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:42,120
I did go through this very fast and I

573
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:44,850
made it through without crying so I'm

574
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:47,549
pretty proud of myself but I will be in

575
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:50,600
the chatroom to answer any questions and

576
00:24:47,549 --> 00:24:53,990
I'm also available anytime via phone

577
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,990
thank you so much

578
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:58,780
Thank You Lora

579
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,520
