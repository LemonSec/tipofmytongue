1
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:30,810
unusual data hello everybody and welcome

2
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,970
to this talk about botnets and things

3
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,559
that you can get from them my name is

4
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,750
Alex old and I'm a chief information

5
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,669
security officer for hold security

6
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,730
we are threat intelligence and dark web

7
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:44,489
monitoring company and the reason I'm

8
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:47,849
talking about botnets today is it for

9
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:51,720
over a decade it's been my passion

10
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:55,559
figuring out the biggest and worst cyber

11
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:58,320
crime groups out there and what they are

12
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:01,589
doing there are lots of different ways

13
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,890
of a cyber criminals attacking systems

14
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:07,619
the ways to abuse it the data breaching

15
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:10,200
databases as you know information but

16
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:13,640
the most common way and most potent way

17
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,729
today and over the past decade been

18
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:22,130
virus infections and data stolen over

19
00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:24,658
the virus infection infected machines so

20
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:27,360
number of years ago we started exploring

21
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:30,329
these things and from my work was brain

22
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,759
crabs on jabber sauce gang and figuring

23
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:35,220
out how those botnet worked

24
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,590
GAMEOVER Zeus and many others we got

25
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,479
very interested in mining data from both

26
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,909
botnets but how do you mind

27
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:44,640
data from something that you can see and

28
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:48,479
it's hidden by default well we try to

29
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:51,270
approach this question with social

30
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,939
engineering because breaking into botnet

31
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,679
panels possible but we're difficult and

32
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:57,539
you get kicked out but when you get

33
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,610
invited through social engineering of

34
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:03,509
cyber criminals you'll definitely get

35
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:06,270
their first arrow view over all the

36
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:08,519
activities and this is what we can be

37
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,889
talking today our inside into the

38
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:14,430
botnets what we are seeing and how we

39
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:16,619
see things progressing so the bucket is

40
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,150
much more than in virus infected system

41
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,430
we'll talk about the kinds of botnets

42
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,980
are out there and what information is

43
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:26,910
gathering difficult data types that we

44
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:29,310
see being traded through the botnets and

45
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:32,250
the information that is stolen in

46
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:34,390
addition to just the typical data types

47
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:37,050
and also understanding

48
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:40,750
that's how the we can use their

49
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:42,940
information for good to defend things

50
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:44,950
and also what to do but be you

51
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:48,130
investigate botnets how do you defend

52
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:53,140
your identity and there's hide yourself

53
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:54,910
from this type of research so first

54
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:57,549
we're gonna be talking a little bit

55
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:59,200
about typical botnet to give you what

56
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:01,860
are the background so you know what we

57
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,480
are talking about in the Alex way more

58
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:07,209
particulars in the detail but just to

59
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,190
give you an idea that first wouldn't be

60
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:13,390
talking about the virus distribution

61
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:16,269
networks and how the viruses get on

62
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:20,380
systems through driving traffic and

63
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:24,940
getting infected emails or malicious

64
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:28,120
websites to both malicious payload on

65
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:31,090
your machine sometimes what they call

66
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:35,410
Boulder use the dropper that's something

67
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:37,330
that it gets ingrained in your system

68
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:40,980
and it distributes itself throughout

69
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:43,360
your system finding itself from the

70
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:47,609
security of software like antivirus and

71
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:50,650
anti-malware components agents that the

72
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:55,090
botnet is building and communications

73
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:57,549
with CNC or command control centers or C

74
00:03:55,090 --> 00:04:00,100
tools for short and then also this

75
00:03:57,549 --> 00:04:02,410
distribution network behind the

76
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:07,090
Bartlett's so a lot of things to cover a

77
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:08,560
lot of real-life examples and stories so

78
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,480
first I want to give you a brief

79
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,010
introduction to command they can prompt

80
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,230
and also we will be talking about them

81
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:16,988
in details throughout today's

82
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:20,200
presentation but the biggest thing is to

83
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:23,289
give you an idea that not all command

84
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,969
control panels are created equal not all

85
00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:28,360
of them I use 'full not all of them

86
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:31,539
interesting but first of all in C tools

87
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:35,740
size matters amount of data that being

88
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:38,140
stolen is very important from the

89
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,970
defense side and also from the size of

90
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:45,640
cyber criminal organization there are a

91
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:47,230
lot of see tools that do serve service

92
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,860
that mother were so

93
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:53,290
we can rent a part of it for their own

94
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:55,330
purposes and those are extremely small

95
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:57,880
and then what they talk about the bigger

96
00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:01,419
ones like Amma that goes into it but and

97
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:03,400
many others which are extremely large

98
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:06,280
one of the largest buttons out there

99
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:09,849
today variety of them what they do and

100
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:13,719
how they function and also understanding

101
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:16,690
that button acumen control centers don't

102
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:19,270
always over offer data some of them done

103
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:22,120
for disability now service attacks

104
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:26,109
some of them done for different purposes

105
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:28,480
even as simple as proxy networks to hide

106
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:30,820
malicious traffic from their original

107
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:35,020
source so let's get started let's talk

108
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:37,810
about the botnets and how initially the

109
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:40,599
infection makes it to our machines first

110
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:42,540
we will discuss a traffic generation the

111
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,880
way that the bad guys actually

112
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:48,640
distribute their payloads and whether it

113
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:51,190
obviously happens through email people

114
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:54,310
click on things all the time but that's

115
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:55,660
not the only way that the bad guys are

116
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:58,480
distributing things they're also

117
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:00,670
building these type of panels that I'm

118
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:04,660
showing right now and this is one JAMA

119
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:08,680
that distribution panels that is driving

120
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:11,590
traffic web traffic through different

121
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:15,550
advertisements through again malicious

122
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:18,789
clicks through email or even things that

123
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:23,710
you go and search through Google

124
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:27,550
answering that that gets built in search

125
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:30,789
engines toward the top through where is

126
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:34,030
many privations so this is a very simple

127
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:36,190
panel that driving traffic to a

128
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:38,409
particular malicious web site it keeps

129
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:40,090
track not only of who comes in but what

130
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:42,490
they do will help browsers they have

131
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:47,049
what's they work out and if they are

132
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:50,140
successful in their payload distribution

133
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:53,980
or not keep in mind that in this stage

134
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:55,870
when the virus just gets the intended

135
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,730
target it's still now gonna be hung

136
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:59,230
percent successful because the antivirus

137
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:00,380
is good for something

138
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:03,830
not much but

139
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:08,560
does prevent some infections from

140
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:12,469
happening and in many cases we see about

141
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:15,500
30 to 40 percent success after the

142
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:18,680
impact machine or machine comes to the

143
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:20,900
site and tries to get infected and then

144
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,600
the bad guys also do management of their

145
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:26,150
campaigns they manage their campaigns

146
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:28,250
moreover campaigns through various

147
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:32,960
standard tools were in a very similar

148
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:37,100
way to figuring out the success of a

149
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:39,109
normal ad campaign they are trying to

150
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:42,860
figure out how successful it was and

151
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:45,620
they actually pay out their campaign

152
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:49,010
managers for success

153
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:51,920
it's definitely pennies on the dollar or

154
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:55,520
much much less but definitely me see the

155
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:58,990
success rates for the bad guys exceeding

156
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:03,620
some expectations and they are showing

157
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:06,140
how much infection they throw through a

158
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:08,960
certain campaign once the machine gets

159
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:10,550
infected it goes inside of this see -

160
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,010
and this is where we're going to spend a

161
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:16,670
lot of time today discussing and showing

162
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:18,860
ins and outs of those components when

163
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:20,870
the virus is on the machine it's

164
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:22,520
gathering weather information and the

165
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,990
bad guys want to know as much

166
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:27,409
information about the Machine as

167
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:30,980
possible so they are engaged in the

168
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:34,240
really cool control panels that show a

169
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:36,950
lot of interesting data they show

170
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,409
demographics they show geographical

171
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:41,599
distribution and so on and so forth so

172
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:45,740
this is an example from the trip back

173
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:48,820
part that which shows for a particular

174
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:53,510
campaign how much infection how much

175
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:56,780
data point impacted that they were able

176
00:08:53,510 --> 00:09:00,890
to make and we can create these graphs

177
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:02,990
ourselves so for our analytics of box

178
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:05,120
and the information that we got from the

179
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:08,780
buttons like amethyst we actually build

180
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:12,800
these type of graphs for ourselves using

181
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:14,060
the victim data to figure out where the

182
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,430
biggest infection

183
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:19,219
components are happening so in early

184
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:21,890
2020 we actually saw change of the game

185
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:25,730
not only because of covert onset but

186
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:27,830
also because of the change in practice

187
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:29,510
in some of the major apartment operators

188
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:32,810
so for example Emmett I think you can

189
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:35,450
see by this hit graph is not targeting

190
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:39,530
United States as much as its targeting

191
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:43,130
Europe Middle East and Far East like

192
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:45,680
South Korea so the focus also were

193
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:47,750
important to monitor in the intention of

194
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:51,199
cyber criminals who operate in those

195
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:53,210
Bartlet's it's also trying to shift from

196
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,760
the standard attack United States make

197
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:58,370
money to attack the world make even more

198
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:03,530
money and then we see the brown dress in

199
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:07,220
different pockets like anibus which

200
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:10,339
source code was leaked online over a

201
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:13,900
year ago the adaptations and continuous

202
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:17,330
development of this mobile botnet

203
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:21,740
software is actually taking new leaves

204
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:26,150
in its progression so we actually

205
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:31,089
noticing that they build more components

206
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:34,670
around by metric monitoring so anibus is

207
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:38,030
android-based botnet and it's using

208
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:41,479
androids feature to monitor eye

209
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:43,430
movements of the user if to figure out

210
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,190
if the user is looking at the screen or

211
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:48,739
not and if this feature is enabled

212
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:52,010
animus actually reports it to its panel

213
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:54,770
it's also grabbing information from the

214
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:56,960
pedometer counting number of steps that

215
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:58,189
person is making no it does not care

216
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:01,010
about your health

217
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:03,710
you can be as active or inactive as you

218
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:05,450
want to be but the reason why it's

219
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:08,200
monitoring the eye movement and the

220
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:11,120
steps is to figure out if the victim is

221
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:15,020
using the phone actively if the victim

222
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:18,020
is looking at the screen anibus some of

223
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:21,140
its manipulations may be visible to a

224
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:23,209
person who is actively looking at the

225
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:25,220
screen so the bad guys figure out that

226
00:11:23,209 --> 00:11:27,290
they check for our movement if somebody

227
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:30,070
activate looking the screen

228
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:33,529
they assume that if person is walking

229
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:35,839
and doing something on the phone they're

230
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:37,910
not likely paying great attention to

231
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:41,570
their screen so they're getting that

232
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:43,790
information proactively and creating

233
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:46,430
these proprietary actions they also

234
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:50,089
build certain protections on the

235
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:53,359
Mobile's side against antivirus so it

236
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:56,300
has an exclusion list over a lot of

237
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:59,060
antivirus suffer for Android that once

238
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:02,209
anibus botnet is installed on your

239
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:05,839
device it's actually going to be

240
00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:08,029
uninstalling the security suffered that

241
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,819
you may be trying to vote after you've

242
00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:13,279
been infected it for uninstall but in it

243
00:12:10,819 --> 00:12:15,290
will report success it will even install

244
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:18,380
and I can in the list of your

245
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:19,880
applications that to show you that you

246
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:22,790
installed something but when you click

247
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:25,910
on it it does massive so intelligence

248
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:28,880
built in to anibal's and many other

249
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:32,569
botnets it's extremely important another

250
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:36,439
trait but component is to monitor amount

251
00:12:32,569 --> 00:12:39,260
of bots online throughout the day it

252
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:43,100
monitors it specifically to figure out

253
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:45,230
what amount of firepower does it have if

254
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:48,470
they try to do this rebuilding our

255
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:50,899
service attack or anything else they

256
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:53,209
need to know what amount of traffic they

257
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:56,209
can anticipate and what they can sell to

258
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:59,180
others they also like to provide big

259
00:12:56,209 --> 00:13:01,939
picture a lot of analytics built into

260
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:05,510
these c2 panels to show the bad guys

261
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:08,510
what they have and what success rates

262
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:11,329
are not only there currently is systems

263
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:14,959
online to track traffic distribution but

264
00:13:11,329 --> 00:13:18,649
also success of every specific spam

265
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:20,329
campaign phishing campaign or more were

266
00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:24,259
contained that they have because they

267
00:13:20,329 --> 00:13:27,079
give different regions different viruses

268
00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:28,850
different approaches so a lot of

269
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:32,888
components on the big picture is also

270
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:35,930
needed the big part of the botnet

271
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:40,399
unfortunately is our injects these are

272
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:41,400
specific injects to emulate or intercept

273
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,640
data for me

274
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:47,670
applications usually it's banking social

275
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:51,060
media a large trapping sites or anything

276
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:54,510
that can be used to steal financial

277
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:59,069
information or other major data the bad

278
00:13:54,510 --> 00:14:00,990
guys seek access to email systems but to

279
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:03,330
control some of these components for

280
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:06,270
example Woolsey is intelligent enough to

281
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:09,240
figure out if it if you are constantly

282
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:11,730
evolving to an application for example

283
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:15,600
Amazon that does not really lock you out

284
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:18,060
to capture your credentials for Amazon

285
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,580
it can because it's built in as I'm

286
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:24,390
there just a communication talking so

287
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:25,860
from that perspective goes about that

288
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:28,610
actually looks you out from different

289
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:31,830
applications from banks from Amazon from

290
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:34,410
PayPal and others to see how you go back

291
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:37,350
and once you are logging into the

292
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:40,110
application it's using these injects to

293
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:42,240
figure out your typical behavior you

294
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:44,760
know how you look into the financial

295
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,230
application over the internet for the

296
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,090
first time it's gonna ask you a whole

297
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:51,560
bunch of interesting information not

298
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:54,180
only your username and password but also

299
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:56,520
will ask you for additional information

300
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:58,140
secret questions you must have made the

301
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,990
name maybe your social security number

302
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:01,740
the number on your paying card things

303
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:04,470
like that

304
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:08,280
so these engines actually build between

305
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:11,520
the website and the victim in an

306
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:13,140
emulator of the virus and they are

307
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,660
instructed to steal additional

308
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:18,420
information so the bad guys can emulate

309
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:21,209
that behavior and try to log in as you

310
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:22,920
on every single level and later on more

311
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:26,210
actually goes through an example of how

312
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:29,849
this data can be strong how can it be

313
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:31,860
used or abused on different levels

314
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:34,650
actually going through an example of

315
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:36,270
stolen data and abuse and then the bad

316
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:39,390
guys are constantly adding new features

317
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:41,730
the new features for themselves to make

318
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:44,150
their lives easier and some of them for

319
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:47,310
security researchers like ourselves to

320
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:49,230
get as much data from the panel as

321
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:53,229
possible so this is an example again

322
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:56,260
from animals

323
00:15:53,230 --> 00:16:00,760
very variant where they build a stealer

324
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:03,730
and it's misspelled for some reason that

325
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:06,400
allows just harvest credentials was in

326
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:11,530
best particular budget to download it

327
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:14,740
all together in the one one command over

328
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:17,560
a period of time but let's also go into

329
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:21,450
more intelligent mode with our apartment

330
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:24,280
is well-known to actually harvest

331
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:26,290
information and classify what kind of

332
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:29,290
media it has was in its repositories

333
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:31,390
because does this export machine have

334
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:35,490
PayPal account does have a Netflix

335
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:39,069
account or they have any connections to

336
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:42,400
banks or anything else so then when

337
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:45,010
looking at this by when somebody looks

338
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:47,610
at that they see what information is

339
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:51,250
available and they can do intelligent

340
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:54,280
selection components to figure out what

341
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:58,110
can be gathered from this particular

342
00:16:54,280 --> 00:17:02,199
machine based on with our botnet a big

343
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:05,170
website that offers butlet's logs for

344
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:09,370
sale genesis that market is actually

345
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:13,660
using the base of the DAR to sell one

346
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:15,639
button record at a time so if a

347
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:18,250
malicious person walks into this

348
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:21,190
particular market they have no access to

349
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:25,119
data by default but for just couple

350
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:28,030
bucks they can buy particular BOTS with

351
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:30,699
particular information sets and this

352
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:33,460
paid play bar though is becoming more

353
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:35,530
popular with these type of botnets

354
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:38,440
Genesis market has about three hundred

355
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:41,710
eleven thousand victim service in its

356
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:44,290
database right now so what's tough about

357
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:47,380
the standard multiple botnet data

358
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:51,430
what's interesting to the bad guys and

359
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:52,630
what is not particularly useful from

360
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:54,850
their perspective

361
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:57,460
now when the information gets stolen

362
00:17:54,850 --> 00:18:01,719
from a machine the bad guys don't try to

363
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:02,710
differentiate what can be viable right

364
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,780
now or later

365
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:06,760
they hope the maniacs they try to steal

366
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:10,149
as much data as

367
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:12,280
a certain day that is increasingly more

368
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:15,940
valuable than others and some of these

369
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:17,830
basic Morgan's information as a man

370
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:21,130
should not only username and password

371
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:23,260
but significantly more data than this is

372
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:26,890
stolen from financial institutions

373
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:29,890
shopping sites social media reward

374
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:31,870
programs hotels and airlines for example

375
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:36,280
because those are monitored

376
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:40,149
significantly less than others from a

377
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:42,460
perspective of fraud or abuse also no

378
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:44,830
enforcement is not very apt to protect

379
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:48,070
their good programs because a lot of

380
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:51,669
reward points miles or anything like

381
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:53,320
that kind of zero dollar value in no

382
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:56,530
matter how many points some of these

383
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:58,840
skills it's still gonna be a zero dollar

384
00:18:56,530 --> 00:19:03,520
value unless it tries to cash out for

385
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:07,050
physical goods that have value now one

386
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:10,510
of the biggest directions in 2020 the

387
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:13,330
ones the most valuable points are is

388
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:16,390
corporate data in form of Citrix and RDP

389
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:18,639
access some of those accounts go upwards

390
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:21,880
till twenty twenty-five thousand dollars

391
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:24,460
per single account in hopes to install

392
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:27,309
ransom err on corporate networks and

393
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:28,059
gaining significantly more money through

394
00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:30,730
ransom

395
00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:32,920
gambling sites also very often so on

396
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:36,309
because quite a few separate criminals

397
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:38,679
have gambling addiction and we've seen

398
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:43,540
cases where cyber criminals get access

399
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:45,160
to somebody's gambling account go in and

400
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:48,700
gamble with somebody's money they don't

401
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:50,590
care if they win all those they just

402
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,780
enjoy themselves at somebody else's time

403
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:55,199
if they win obviously they can try to

404
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:57,160
cash out the money from the Bini account

405
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,940
so financial data

406
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:03,370
besides the direct information access to

407
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:07,210
banks maybe in forms of credit cards or

408
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:09,540
being information maybe Bitcoin boards

409
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:13,750
and other components and beside that

410
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:16,389
this own sort of data that the bad guys

411
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:19,290
try to steal for future abuse including

412
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:22,380
PII information about other

413
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:24,750
opponents and they steal additional

414
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:28,260
information including screenshots files

415
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:31,950
for the future use and abuse as I

416
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:36,810
mentioned I want to show you an idea

417
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:42,660
about the data that is being stolen when

418
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:45,240
a botnet virus gets hold on your system

419
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,840
it's not only stealing usernames and

420
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,270
passwords

421
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,370
let's think from the past yes it steals

422
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:55,010
that confirmation but there's so much

423
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:58,290
more to it so here's an example of UK

424
00:20:55,010 --> 00:21:00,960
banking account that was stolen and

425
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:04,470
trafficked on the dark web by the cyber

426
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:06,510
criminals it's simply much more

427
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:07,770
information than a standard component

428
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:11,700
let's just take a look

429
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:14,100
point by point so name first you know we

430
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,780
get rid of some personal identifiable

431
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:19,439
information to keep the victim's

432
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:23,879
identity safe or from further

433
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:26,100
exploitation rather that so this lady

434
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:31,670
Allison who was born born in the

435
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:35,449
nineteen something in March lives in UK

436
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:38,760
there is full information available and

437
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:41,640
phone number email address driver's

438
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:44,280
license number National Insurance number

439
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:47,460
which seems to be a point of our social

440
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:50,550
security number in UK mother's maiden

441
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:54,900
name the bad guys also found the picture

442
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:59,280
of a person's passport on her computer

443
00:21:54,900 --> 00:22:01,560
and they are folded in gore so the abuse

444
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,190
and the identity verification can be

445
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,830
easier

446
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:09,150
so that's page one page two hurts

447
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:12,360
finding financial information we see her

448
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:14,910
big information from the bin number but

449
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:19,100
make identification number which is

450
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:22,110
Lloyds in UK what kind of card this is

451
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:24,000
information about the bank the website

452
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:26,639
just in case and the phone number if we

453
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,370
need to be cold for the serious abuse

454
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:33,090
the bad guys and not afraid to pick up a

455
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:35,969
phone and dial and impersonate this

456
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:38,310
try to gain full access to her account

457
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:41,520
and they have call center so even if

458
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:43,830
it's a meal cybercriminal dake i can go

459
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,830
through another cybercriminal call

460
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:51,810
center to instruct female callers to

461
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:54,480
impersonate miss Allanson and given all

462
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:57,480
her personal information now we got the

463
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,580
name on a credit card we got the card

464
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:02,990
number itself expiration date and

465
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:04,800
additional information page 3 we got

466
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:09,750
finally see Mimi

467
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:12,990
date of birth and finally on page 3 we

468
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:15,830
only see a password so it's not just one

469
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:20,160
set of data it's a lot of data that all

470
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:22,980
combined into a single profile the login

471
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:25,710
information for this person her last

472
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:28,020
known IP user agent and additional

473
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:32,670
components cookies that she might have

474
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:35,220
used recently lastly there is additional

475
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:41,040
settings for fraud Fox which is an

476
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:46,170
emulator for Firefox portable that is

477
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:50,220
able to take advantage of any browser or

478
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:54,420
device given the full profile so it's

479
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:57,360
gonna emulate Alison's browser in all

480
00:23:54,420 --> 00:24:01,560
the details it has all the data that's

481
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:04,919
listed over here plus this full profile

482
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:08,520
which is a fingerprint of her browser as

483
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:11,610
it would appear to any system that tries

484
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:15,600
to acquire and identify her machine so

485
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:17,550
if the bad guy uses right proxy they

486
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,949
would have there are all the information

487
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:22,010
about Alison and also all technical

488
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:26,220
information that they need to full

489
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:29,580
Lloyd's defenses to get in so this is

490
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:32,700
seriously more information yes there are

491
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:34,260
better defenses against this yes there

492
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:38,130
are additional

493
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:40,410
footholds that somebody can use to

494
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:43,110
identify all this fraud but you have to

495
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:44,740
appreciate how much data is being stolen

496
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:47,469
from an average

497
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:51,340
in order to abuse a single credit card

498
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:54,640
and abuse is very likely if the credit

499
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:58,990
card activity would not raise any other

500
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:02,679
suspicion so let's talk about other uses

501
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:05,620
of this botnet data for good for

502
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:08,409
information that we can use for on the

503
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:10,209
defense side first of all we need to

504
00:25:08,409 --> 00:25:10,750
recognize that botnet data is mostly

505
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:14,799
correct

506
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:17,110
so it's an end user that is actually

507
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:19,510
providing this information it's not a

508
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:22,840
guessing game it's not good forcing it's

509
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:25,390
not the reuse of data it's specific data

510
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:28,750
from a particular source yes

511
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:30,549
users and users make typos yes this

512
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:32,380
forget their passwords don't try to look

513
00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:34,090
into things that they don't should not

514
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:37,330
be working in that information would be

515
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:40,360
incorrect but the verse of majority of

516
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:42,340
other data would be fun percent about

517
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:44,678
and correct at the time when it's being

518
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:48,939
entered it's also extremely about

519
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:52,450
documented so the botnet records said

520
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:54,899
was in database and it shows every

521
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:58,000
single step of a system

522
00:25:54,899 --> 00:26:02,520
how did is being stolen from there so

523
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,419
it's useful to get for forensics for

524
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:06,850
investigations and to understand the

525
00:26:04,419 --> 00:26:10,600
full impact of a single virus infection

526
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:13,209
it's also in many cases extremely well

527
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:15,570
illustrated the bad guys take pictures

528
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:20,289
and we'll go through that in just a bit

529
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:22,090
but they the new trend is as a virus

530
00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:25,840
gets on the system to take a screenshot

531
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:29,168
and also take it image from a web camera

532
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:31,539
if it's attached to the machine so in

533
00:26:29,169 --> 00:26:34,720
mean cases we are finding that these

534
00:26:31,539 --> 00:26:36,370
type of activities capture images that

535
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,399
extremely unusual especially the web

536
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:41,469
cameras that capture images of a things

537
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:45,850
in front of them in many cases we are

538
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:49,029
finding out these are people behind some

539
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:51,459
computers are kids and spying on kids

540
00:26:49,029 --> 00:26:53,020
through web cameras is a different type

541
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:56,100
of home

542
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:57,700
we also see seeing within botnet data

543
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:59,469
the research

544
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:03,100
from the bad guys they actually do a

545
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:05,950
great job documenting things and leaving

546
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:07,750
their remarks so in main cases in case

547
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:10,480
of breaches or special around somewhere

548
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:13,330
we can reassembled by based on these

549
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:16,179
notes what had occurred in in some cases

550
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:18,580
prevent breaches from happening

551
00:27:16,179 --> 00:27:22,360
because we would see the real time note

552
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:24,970
updating as in certain buttons we did

553
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:28,000
one interesting experiment in collecting

554
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:30,850
stone credentials in main cases we can't

555
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,490
tell where the data is coming from if

556
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:35,678
it's a uniform that dumped from a single

557
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:38,320
source and usually there are ways to

558
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:41,139
figure out that if the data that we're

559
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:43,090
looking for in credential dump coming

560
00:27:41,139 --> 00:27:45,789
from a single source or not based on how

561
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:48,610
many user IDs there are and if there any

562
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:51,010
redundant ones we still don't have much

563
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:52,990
information about where it came from if

564
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:55,929
the bad guys don't mark something stone

565
00:27:52,990 --> 00:28:00,010
from here or so on from there it's hard

566
00:27:55,929 --> 00:28:04,659
to tell but credentials can be compared

567
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:07,299
to the other information and if we map

568
00:28:04,659 --> 00:28:10,149
the credentials to the botnet data we're

569
00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:12,940
starting to see a lot of different

570
00:28:10,149 --> 00:28:16,629
components we got over 10 billion botnet

571
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:20,110
records we got over 12 billion unique

572
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:22,840
and unencrypted credential records so we

573
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:25,719
can connect compare these two for our

574
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:27,908
purposes to figure out them some bounce

575
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:30,669
of data especially credentials and

576
00:28:27,909 --> 00:28:32,769
figuring out where they come from we can

577
00:28:30,669 --> 00:28:35,440
match based on user names and we can

578
00:28:32,769 --> 00:28:37,360
also match them on passwords we can

579
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,580
figure out the dates because botnets as

580
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,799
I mentioned extremely well Illustrated

581
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:44,168
and documented so when something was

582
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:47,230
stolen and how so we can figure out

583
00:28:44,169 --> 00:28:49,600
based on that the data that is present

584
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:53,110
in the back networks and the data that's

585
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,789
present in credentials to figure out not

586
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:57,250
only where the data is coming from by

587
00:28:54,789 --> 00:29:00,220
looking at significant matches our

588
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:02,679
credentials from botnets to the

589
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:05,590
credential dump and seeing that it's

590
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:09,460
matching to a specific victim but we can

591
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:10,540
also tell when this potential opened

592
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:13,120
this

593
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:15,420
had happen based on the data that's

594
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:18,310
present in the credential dump and

595
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:19,930
basically that's not present crashing

596
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:23,159
down so if credential dump happen in

597
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:26,260
2018 and we got 2019 button and data

598
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:28,360
that sums the registrations in 2019

599
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:30,430
simply didn't happen yet when the breach

600
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:33,610
occurred in 2018 so we can actually

601
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:36,400
predict this and say the breach had

602
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:38,350
happened this year or that year because

603
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:42,280
we got additional information about

604
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:45,550
accounts that existed or in the system

605
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:47,440
or did not exist yet and also we can see

606
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:49,960
that people change their passwords

607
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,760
throughout their presence so we can see

608
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,560
that if somebody changed her password

609
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,710
after the bridge show before the bridge

610
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:59,320
it's also going to be reflected in the

611
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:03,850
credential dump compared to the botnet

612
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:04,840
data we also are able to do additional

613
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:07,300
advanced

614
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:09,669
tracking and figuring out how infection

615
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:12,159
took place what kind of device was

616
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:15,670
impacted is it desktop or mobile device

617
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:17,650
what kind of what happened to this

618
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:21,250
device did it change its IP addresses

619
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:23,380
they move from the personal Network but

620
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:25,540
it was less protected in what most

621
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:29,770
likely the other virus they're down to

622
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:32,980
its corporate location also tracking

623
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:35,620
movements similar to under this button

624
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:39,580
we can see if somebody is moving around

625
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:43,000
or not and honorable say incremented

626
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:45,399
their integration with Yandex Maps so

627
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,280
they can understand the physical

628
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:52,150
movements of the phone and when they

629
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:54,700
emulate that phone they can be hiding to

630
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:57,090
specific IP location within physical

631
00:30:54,700 --> 00:31:00,340
account where they are located right now

632
00:30:57,090 --> 00:31:02,649
versus where they actually registered

633
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:05,590
the phone because people used to travel

634
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:08,260
at least until now and also we see

635
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:10,330
corporate assets exportation

636
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:13,600
buttons like Amma that when it

637
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:16,750
establishes its base on machine start

638
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,760
exploring local network bajo active

639
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:21,880
directory to figure out how many devices

640
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:23,790
are was in specific ie if it's a

641
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:27,330
workstation if it's standalone

642
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:30,450
what a divorce looks like and so on and

643
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:33,330
so forth so these things that actually

644
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:35,850
be harvested by but that's extremely

645
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:38,580
useful for us to understand and to track

646
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:40,649
later on I want to take you on an

647
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:44,189
interesting journey in them they'll show

648
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:47,430
you as I mentioned the screenshots that

649
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:49,770
are being taken by a virus

650
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:53,730
as soon as establishes its foothold on

651
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:58,200
the machine so a virus infects an end

652
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:59,970
device somehow and what it does it needs

653
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,310
to hide itself first

654
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:04,740
from the point view it disables anti

655
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:08,490
virus to certain degree it cripples

656
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:11,430
other detection on the system and then

657
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:13,290
it starts establishing his foothold it

658
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:16,650
realizes that at some point somebody

659
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:21,980
will try to detect it and CTools

660
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:25,680
actually check for virus being

661
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:29,820
detectable with a number of different

662
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:32,600
antivirus solutions and seeing if these

663
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:36,030
antivirus solutions that detect this

664
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:37,560
executable as a virus if it's detected

665
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:39,180
it

666
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:42,240
first of all checks every single minute

667
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:45,780
so every minute the virus on your

668
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:48,030
machine chefs if it's still a virus an

669
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:51,530
unknown virus as soon as it becomes a

670
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:55,620
known virus within a minute it issues

671
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:58,680
command where it downloads a new newly

672
00:32:55,620 --> 00:33:02,280
obfuscated replacement for itself that

673
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:05,130
is not detectable and hence overall the

674
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:07,440
control to this new obfuscated

675
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:09,930
executable before the readings are from

676
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,580
system so you may have a fully

677
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:14,900
functional antivirus on your machine

678
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:18,629
that does signature based detection and

679
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:22,020
the virus always gonna be faster because

680
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:24,990
it takes up to four minutes for it to

681
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:26,700
replace itself with a numerous versus

682
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:30,030
your machine checking for new signatures

683
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:33,570
couple times a day and in main case is

684
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:36,440
not very effective so what happens when

685
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:39,260
a virus gets established on

686
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:42,500
system is when it's done looking around

687
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:45,320
it takes a screenshot to figure out

688
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:47,690
where it is and for some logging in for

689
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:50,149
some prosperity so I kind of want to

690
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:52,880
create give you a picture of what the

691
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:56,180
virus sees happening on the desktop as

692
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:59,000
soon as it gets infected I'm gonna start

693
00:33:56,180 --> 00:34:01,640
with category - because category 1 you

694
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,520
can guess and my voters told me that I

695
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:06,920
could not show porn on in my

696
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:10,310
presentations so we'll start was

697
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:12,889
category 2 where somebody sees something

698
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:14,360
going on on their own machine they not

699
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:16,969
come percent sure what they just

700
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:19,190
installed so they turn to that antivirus

701
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:22,069
and antivirus said hey don't worry

702
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:24,710
everything is ok it says in different

703
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:26,600
languages in different formats from

704
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:30,429
different perspectives and then I came

705
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:33,980
over but even love to get your feedback

706
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:36,259
it will want you to rate your virus

707
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:39,050
installation experience and more where

708
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:40,580
by its inability to detect it on scale 1

709
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:43,790
to 10

710
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:46,159
then we can't worry 3 is to seek help

711
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:48,889
people in me in cases realized I did

712
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:51,230
something wrong and they start going

713
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:53,839
through different scanning different

714
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:57,139
components and virus

715
00:34:53,840 --> 00:35:00,680
laughs and whatever way it can laugh by

716
00:34:57,139 --> 00:35:04,160
just taking a screenshot or somebody

717
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:09,230
trying to seek help to try to uninstall

718
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:11,509
the virus in different ways and another

719
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:14,390
way people try to cope with its own

720
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:16,490
viruses is uninstalling random software

721
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:20,060
because they assume that all wires has

722
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:21,950
come as an install procedure because

723
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:24,560
that's how we're supposed to work right

724
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:26,600
that's what Microsoft told us we see

725
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,730
very often these kind of an install

726
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:30,860
screen swear and somebody's thinks what

727
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:33,680
I install something bad I can just

728
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:36,700
install it not everywhere is counsellors

729
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:39,319
and install instructions and easy

730
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:42,470
executables was in Microsoft environment

731
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:44,360
actually none of them though so from

732
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:49,009
that perspective you know people are

733
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:50,099
being less informed about what they just

734
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:53,150
did and

735
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:58,700
even less informed in doing other things

736
00:35:53,150 --> 00:36:01,710
the next component or next category of

737
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:03,899
desperation is to install more viruses

738
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:06,420
because as soon as you realize that you

739
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:09,779
install a virus you go out on the

740
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:12,329
internet and try to get antivirus and

741
00:36:09,779 --> 00:36:16,499
instead of getting something commercial

742
00:36:12,329 --> 00:36:19,170
grade or something legitimate you go and

743
00:36:16,499 --> 00:36:21,689
download some random sufferer that

744
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:24,660
claims to and then so anything that you

745
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:28,200
just install and make your computer more

746
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:32,430
secure so this run and score zero a six

747
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:36,149
ad set up is definitely the legitimate

748
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:38,299
antivirus and installer that would help

749
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:41,789
you with all your security needs right

750
00:36:38,299 --> 00:36:45,119
so that's another mistake people making

751
00:36:41,789 --> 00:36:49,319
from the perspective of cyber criminals

752
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:54,660
we see this new category being much more

753
00:36:49,319 --> 00:36:56,519
common when somebody installs one virus

754
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:59,910
installs itself on the system it

755
00:36:56,519 --> 00:37:03,629
realizes it's not the first virus that

756
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:07,288
is present in system in fact category 5

757
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:11,069
where we have people and installing

758
00:37:07,289 --> 00:37:14,670
random software sickens virus we see

759
00:37:11,069 --> 00:37:17,400
sometimes that this is the virus that we

760
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:19,190
are monitoring is that what her said to

761
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:22,229
being installed as a secondary

762
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:26,339
precautionary component and in many

763
00:37:22,229 --> 00:37:28,919
cases when you install virus on your

764
00:37:26,339 --> 00:37:30,989
computer you start panicking and you

765
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:34,039
know additional software gets installed

766
00:37:30,989 --> 00:37:39,049
so for example DDoS sufferer or

767
00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:43,799
different types of ransomware and

768
00:37:39,049 --> 00:37:46,650
different attack controllers from all

769
00:37:43,799 --> 00:37:47,910
around the world so from that

770
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:49,349
perspective just in your trying to

771
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:51,479
understand that

772
00:37:49,349 --> 00:37:55,190
victims often don't know what they're

773
00:37:51,479 --> 00:37:58,680
doing and they hating even the worst

774
00:37:55,190 --> 00:38:00,599
situation by sowing more viruses on

775
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,529
their machine and instead of seeking

776
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:03,540
professional help

777
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:05,760
we also did

778
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:09,000
very interesting piece of research we

779
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:13,290
did we tried to figure out who is

780
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:16,350
patient zero on the botnet why well

781
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:18,480
usually when the button just starts

782
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:21,810
working and they in fact the first

783
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:24,270
machine we get an idea of what cyber

784
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:28,170
criminals are thinking in in their

785
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:31,440
infection methods they are targeting

786
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:34,110
specific networks is targeting a

787
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:37,620
specific country and then expanded

788
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:41,120
themselves all work in this case with

789
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:45,509
Romanian cyber criminals they install

790
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:48,900
their malicious payload on one of their

791
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:51,120
machines just to test how it works they

792
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,680
definitely can uninstall their own virus

793
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:55,589
they know actually how it works

794
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:59,190
so there are virus may compass uninstall

795
00:38:55,590 --> 00:39:03,840
but what we see in the botnet control is

796
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:07,380
at first signal and data about their

797
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:11,400
machine we actually even got one about

798
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:13,440
that where the guys just didn't think

799
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:15,390
about turning off the virus on their

800
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,220
machine it just get an information

801
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:19,680
whether it's our system so it's

802
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:21,359
gathering information for us from there

803
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:26,160
we were able to gather all the

804
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:29,280
information about their machine that the

805
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:32,430
bots have collected including evidence

806
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:35,850
of them running this botnet evidence of

807
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:38,669
them doing bad things and exporting

808
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:41,190
victims data as well on top of it so

809
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:43,920
patient zero information sometimes clear

810
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:48,420
is sometimes very important in our

811
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:51,300
investigations now I want to give you

812
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:56,450
more interesting information about

813
00:39:51,300 --> 00:40:00,210
sandboxing some of us actually work on

814
00:39:56,450 --> 00:40:02,970
sandboxing more where analysis in in

815
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:05,370
many cases we install a piece of more

816
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:08,970
robust in our system trying to figure

817
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:11,130
out how it works and in most cases we

818
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:16,140
need to make it make sure that it's

819
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:18,540
communicating back to its control center

820
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:23,060
Center so you can see full functionality

821
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:27,990
of the mower so here's a good example

822
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:30,870
from our friends at fireEye who did not

823
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:35,220
use all possible operation security

824
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:38,130
options in order to install something of

825
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:41,279
their sandboxes we found this not

826
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:44,100
because we actually went out looking but

827
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:46,080
because of where is tied comments from

828
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:48,930
cyber criminals

829
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:50,730
I can't even throw them on the screen

830
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:55,520
because it's obscene even though it's in

831
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:59,220
Russian but don't name your sandboxes

832
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:01,470
like this it's victim pc it's not the

833
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:05,459
best name for the sandbox also don't

834
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:07,529
assault inside of your network it's nice

835
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:10,440
that you know you may have a lot of IP

836
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:13,620
space it's nice it's gonna be completely

837
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:18,960
segregated or it can be part of your ad

838
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:22,220
don't go and create different issues for

839
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:26,100
yourself so a couple advices about

840
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:27,990
sandboxing make sure that when you're

841
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:32,040
building your sandbox it's not born

842
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:37,439
yesterday if your machine was just built

843
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:38,970
or commissioned oviya rebuilt today the

844
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,930
bad guys actually looking for this

845
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:47,640
information the reason why we saw nodes

846
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:51,350
on fire ice devices is because their

847
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:55,259
specific routines was in a method that

848
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:59,160
martyr for sandboxes and disassembly of

849
00:41:55,260 --> 00:42:04,080
their viruses they check applications

850
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:06,180
for history user should have again not

851
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:08,310
just being born yes they were renamed

852
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:12,359
yesterday but should have some specific

853
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:14,580
age to the system your browser should

854
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:17,670
have history applications should be

855
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:20,660
little bit he used you should have

856
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:23,450
documents and everything else and also

857
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:26,850
look for consistent behavior patterns

858
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:28,689
was all that said you know if your

859
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:31,390
machine is

860
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:34,390
really screaming sandbox whether it's

861
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:36,250
named victim BCE or sandbox whether it's

862
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:40,560
trying to gather additional information

863
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:44,550
if it has specific disassembly suffer or

864
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:47,110
any component of what I just mentioned

865
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:49,540
the bad guys would actually detect it

866
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:51,700
and they they have specific routine was

867
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:54,910
in there more where to behave

868
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:57,850
erratically the same criminal should

869
00:42:54,910 --> 00:43:01,839
laugh about our ability to detect

870
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:05,650
certain behaviors simply because we

871
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:08,470
don't always we always assume that

872
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:10,930
everything here behaves as standard if

873
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:14,830
they see that the machine is sandbox

874
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:16,830
they start spewing out garbage and

875
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:19,600
communication in collection patterns

876
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:22,680
confusing the researchers at adding

877
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:25,960
additional components and we saw one

878
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:29,169
payload that was programmed to behave

879
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:34,480
like another payload from a different

880
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:41,410
bucket specifically to throw the folks

881
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:44,950
off and to figure out what to really

882
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:47,049
confuse their investigation efforts so

883
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:49,990
they recovered quite a few things and

884
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:51,850
hopefully it was useful to you guys to

885
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:53,620
understand how about let's work what

886
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:57,779
kind of information is being gathered

887
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:59,160
what kind of abuses are possible what

888
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:03,280
butlet's

889
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:06,609
looking for and how to detect and deal

890
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:10,510
with them for tax this is all that I

891
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:12,520
have to share with you today and I'll be

892
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:16,110
happy to answer any questions right now

893
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:16,110
or later in this Court

894
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:21,610
you

895
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:30,040
you
