18
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,260
just before we get started the virtual

19
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,760
thing is a little bit new for me

20
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,980
this talk is usually highly interactive

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,680
so we are going to be doing things a

22
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,660
little bit differently I know that a lot

23
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,969
of people grew up with Sesame Street or

24
00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:00,029
Dora the Explorer or something like that

25
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:02,550
so we're gonna try this out I'm gonna

26
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,930
ask what color is this ball and I expect

27
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,509
all of you at home to be screaming out

28
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,610
red let's say yes it's red so we're just

29
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,710
gonna try that a little bit here

30
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,689
QA will be at the end we're gonna

31
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,189
transition that over to the discord

32
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:15,360
channels I'll be hanging out in one of

33
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:17,279
the voice channels if you want to talk

34
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,580
otherwise we'll be doing everything in

35
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,280
track three via text so with that out of

36
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,929
the way welcome to zero day to hero day

37
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,570
so about an attack in establishing a

38
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:30,689
security organization Circle City Khan 7

39
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:33,360

here we go first interactions so how

54
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:03,329
many people out there are red teamers

55
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:07,619
got a few of them ok blue teamers

56
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:09,149
a little bit more and then how about the

57
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:10,860
people that don't identify with a color

58
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:13,680
because you do absolutely everything in

59
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,890
your organization you are the IT janitor

60
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,480
you

61
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,940
are the security lead you are the

62
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,130
response person you also take out the

63
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,020
garbage for the office right yeah those

64
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:23,910
are my people that's who I'm looking for

65
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,459
so I'm gonna start off with who this

66
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:29,100
talk is not for this talk is not for

67
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:30,870
people that think they have a mature

68
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,329
security organization that know that

69
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,790
Incident Response is a lockstep

70
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:36,870
procedure where if something happens

71
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:39,299
they know exactly what they're doing

72
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,580
these are not talks for people that

73
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,290
understand that they have a mated DRF

74
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,420
process to make sure I'm systems

75
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:49,019
available all the time who this talk is

76
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:51,059
for is for people that do everything and

77
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,769
know that when it hits the fan they're

78
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,690
gonna be working some really long hours

79
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:56,730
so I want to make those long hours a

80
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:58,230
little less impactful on your life and

81
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:00,268
hopefully you learn a thing or two I'm

82
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:03,660
just kind of going through pro tips and

83
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:05,010
stuff through Incident Response so

84
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,890
throughout this talk I'm gonna be

85
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:09,630
telling a lot of antidotes everything

86
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,339
has been scrubbed to protect the

87
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:13,230
innocent or guilty depending on how you

88
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,600
think about these people these are

89
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:17,959
real-life situations so these are small

90
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,340
businesses their schools their charities

91
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:21,900
governments these are everybody with

92
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,690
underfunded IT where everybody's

93
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,280
stretched super thin if you have an

94
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:28,109
underfunded IT staff there's no way you

95
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,920
have a functioning security organization

96
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:33,989
so these these situations are real just

97
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,899
as a reminder not petya when I started

98
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:39,269
talking about this 2017 one of the

99
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,250
biggest financial impacts of a cyber

100
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:42,739
attack where it was 10 billion dollars

101
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,930
it's probably been adjusted since then

102
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:51,030
but there was a huge impact of the not

103
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:54,450
petya attack so and it's still happening

104
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:58,769
today just through the news June 11th

105
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:59,339
when Saturday ployed multi-stage

106
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:01,320
ransomware

107
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,910
on critical infrastructure luckily it

108
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,100
was a honeypot this time maybe it's not

109
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,870
a honeypot next time knock still had to

110
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,670
shut down part of its network because

111
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:11,250
they were hit by ransomware so this

112
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:12,958
stuff is still happening um you know as

113
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,150
we start talking about it and we stopped

114
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,918
romanticizing ransomware it's just kind

115
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:20,940
of fallen into a normal operation so

116
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:23,070
what I want to do is take you through a

117
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,960
little bit of a hypothetical situation

118
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:27,210
we know what hypothetical means in our

119
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,900
business it means I'm under NDA right so

120
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,489
everything's been

121
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,169
scrubbed and generalized but these

122
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:33,360
lessons learned apply to everybody

123
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:35,520
because I haven't seen a snowflake

124
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,490
example yet where it's oh this is really

125
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,948
unique we got to do something different

126
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:43,530
so we get a text message it's late at

127
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:44,669
night from our pony hair boss hey can

128
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:47,729
you take a look at the network there's a

129
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:50,650
lot of things down take a look so we log

130
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:52,080
into a server and we get presented this

131
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:54,419
you

132
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,659
maybe it looks like this maybe it's you

133
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:59,628
know a text file maybe it's this one

134
00:04:57,659 --> 00:05:03,419
does everybody know what this one was

135
00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:05,310
yeah wanna cry this is one to cry maybe

136
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:06,780
this is this one maybe that is DeeDee

137
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:08,639
Knoll right over your hard drives now

138
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:12,239
you have nothing it's a total

139
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,409
devastation right so what do we do what

140
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,090
are we looking to do right now as

141
00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:16,438
security professionals sorry we're

142
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:19,500
looking for instant response where's the

143
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:22,139
play books what are we doing well okay

144
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,460
so yeah we're parachuting into a place

145
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:24,750
and we're talking to people there yeah

146
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,388
instant response we used to do these

147
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,919
executive table tops they cost us a lot

148
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:30,180
of money the executives really didn't

149
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:32,460
understand what we're trying to do they

150
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,780
got frustrated so we just kind of

151
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,460
dropped the instant response program we

152
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:38,758
know it's important but we we didn't

153
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:40,440
have any instance before this okay well

154
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:42,060
let's talk let's ask to recovery then

155
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,830
says now we need to rebuild this place

156
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:46,229
yeah yeah yeah disaster recovery we have

157
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:47,729
that um Jim the DBA runs these every

158
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:50,758
year right cool

159
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:54,389
can we see these procedures oh yeah

160
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:56,099
let's oh no yes well Jim retired five

161
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:58,889
years ago we haven't done it since then

162
00:05:56,099 --> 00:06:00,330
and yeah we're not sure where Jim lives

163
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:03,330
anymore he's retired and somewhere in a

164
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:05,460
beach okay um do we have system

165
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,710
documentation do we have anybody that

166
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:12,270
can tell me how the systems were built

167
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:14,460
yeah well remember Jim okay okay yeah I

168
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:18,539
get where we're going on this one right

169
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:20,430
so here we go lesson one we're gonna

170
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:23,219
cover two lessons today so lesson one is

171
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:25,589
gonna be recovery from scorched earth at

172
00:06:23,219 --> 00:06:29,279
this point we are sitting in a dumpster

173
00:06:25,589 --> 00:06:32,370
fire right we're gonna start by taking a

174
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:34,349
deep breath this is going to be painful

175
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:36,060
this is going to be difficult this is

176
00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:39,628
going to stretch every skill that you

177
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:41,520
have so I stole two coats from our

178
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:43,949
military branches here in the United

179
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,628
States slow is smooth smooth is fast

180
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:48,029
you don't have time to screw up your

181
00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:50,699
recovery efforts you don't have time for

182
00:06:48,029 --> 00:06:53,219
reinfection and you don't have time to

183
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:55,289
actually debate anything here you need

184
00:06:53,219 --> 00:06:58,710
to move quickly and move with precision

185
00:06:55,289 --> 00:07:01,289
a lot of people are going to be counting

186
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:04,349
on you in a couple different places that

187
00:07:01,289 --> 00:07:05,190
have been working it was if we don't get

188
00:07:04,349 --> 00:07:06,719
the business back up

189
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:08,490
five days we're done we're closing shop

190
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,100
there's gonna be 3,000 people out of

191
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:13,320
work like this is real stuff this is

192
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,790
this is dangerous so you need to move

193
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:17,510
with precision you need to know exactly

194
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:19,680
what you do don't screw it up

195
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:20,789
number two is embrace the suck like I

196
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,950
said this is gonna be awful

197
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:24,210
this is gonna be one of your worst life

198
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:26,070
experiences ever if you're not in

199
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,599
Incident Response used to this stuff

200
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,680
this is going to seem like the worst

201
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,480
thing that could ever happen to you

202
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,610
you're gonna be working long hours

203
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,590
you're gonna be 36 48 hours without

204
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:38,610
sleep you're going to be running around

205
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:42,119
crazy man or woman um it's bad right but

206
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:44,520
if we get through this like a perfect

207
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,810
example right virtual cons we got

208
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,630
through it this is kind of what we do in

209
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:49,950
security we look at adversity and we

210
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:52,050
look at these problems and we just

211
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:53,460
problem-solve right so embrace it then

212
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:55,260
you get a cool story that you can maybe

213
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:58,650
talk it circles city-county dough when

214
00:07:55,260 --> 00:08:00,360
we come back next year I slipped this

215
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:01,469
one in actually after I started talking

216
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,060
about this because I found out a lot of

217
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:05,280
people don't know this um have your

218
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:08,550
legal team sign off on the incident

219
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:11,239
response retainer or the hiring make

220
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:13,590
sure your legal team is involved because

221
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,580
there's gonna be a lot of communications

222
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:16,919
going around there's gonna be a lot of

223
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:19,229
evidence you want that stuff to be under

224
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:21,450
client privilege and um keep

225
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:22,919
confidential because you never know in a

226
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:25,200
couple years when you're gonna have a

227
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:26,909
lawsuit or a subpoena or something where

228
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,380
they're gonna ask for evidence that you

229
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:31,020
just don't have because they were

230
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:33,870
decimated in the attack have your legal

231
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:36,360
team have all this stuff in privilege to

232
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:38,159
kind of maintain a composure of what's

233
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,840
discoverable in court and what's not

234
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,240
they're gonna be the experts in this

235
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,110
field keep them involved they're not

236
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,150
gonna be running here in response

237
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:46,560
meetings however you want to have all

238
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:50,250
the communications to the world going

239
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,349
through them so we took a deep breath we

240
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:54,300
got our legal team step 1 we gotta

241
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:56,400
stabilize this patient we have a person

242
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,870
bleeding out on the table we need to

243
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,760
figure out exactly what's going on so

244
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:02,190
you'll hear me ask a lot of questions

245
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,740
it's always about the questions to drive

246
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:07,230
the right answers right so what do we

247
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,610
know how do we stop this from getting

248
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,950
worse and then how do we make sure that

249
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:14,370
we don't make it worse

250
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:16,500
so let's look at what we know yes I know

251
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:17,850
this looks like your architecture it's

252
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,290
not your architecture this is

253
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,900
everybody's architecture this is just

254
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:23,760
where we're at today and IT everybody

255
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,140
has this legacy Windows environment

256
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,430
because we're all moving to the cloud

257
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,810
but there's a lot of stuff that we

258
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:30,180
haven't figured out how to move up there

259
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:32,160
for reasons X Y & Z so we have this

260
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:34,170
legacy Windows environment and then even

261
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,000
before Windows we have this legacy ERP

262
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:38,280
system right so it's probably like an a

263
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,430
s400 a power series something like that

264
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:44,100
that we're not moving our business core

265
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:45,390
services off of just yet because we're

266
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,350
trying to figure out the best way to do

267
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:48,660
this and we haven't figured out how to

268
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:50,160
justify it yet got all these laptops and

269
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,810
desktops that we've got clients and

270
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,890
everything of course is connected say

271
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,989
internet because that's how the world

272
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:56,880
works

273
00:09:53,990 --> 00:10:01,440
so let's lay out where we sit now after

274
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:03,330
this attack so the on premise Windows

275
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,820
environments decimated

276
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:07,890
everything's impacted there we see c2

277
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,540
traffic going out to the internet from a

278
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:12,540
server environment and our workstation

279
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:14,130
environment not all clients are impacted

280
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:16,530
there's something strange going on but

281
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:18,270
um we're not exactly sure what it is

282
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:21,030
but we do see some are working some

283
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:23,189
aren't but we do see them starting to

284
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:25,140
spread so not sure exactly what's going

285
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,760
on there we know it's a flat network

286
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:29,340
because if it wasn't a flat network we

287
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,560
wouldn't be in this situation the legacy

288
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:33,690
stuff seems ok so does the cloud so it

289
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,689
seems like everything outside of our

290
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:38,180
Windows environment it's it's ok it's

291
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:41,700
still chugging along

292
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:44,280
so interaction point what do we want to

293
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:46,540
do so shout out what do we want to do at

294
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:49,270
this point right now

295
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:51,250
yes I heard we could kill the Internet

296
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:52,600
well if we kill the Internet we're

297
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,880
probably gonna take down business right

298
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,710
we're gonna stop our b2b traffic we're

299
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,800
gonna stop any orders processing and

300
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:01,180
that stuff what if we just powered down

301
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,969
to datacenter that would stop the friend

302
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:06,250
but we might corrupt data we might have

303
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:08,410
transactions in play and we know that we

304
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,850
haven't done dr in the last five years

305
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:11,620
we're not sure if the databases can

306
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:13,060
actually replay all the transactions so

307
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:15,640
we might corrupt an order database

308
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:18,280
something like that the point of this is

309
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:22,420
let's list out all of our actions on

310
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:24,610
what we can do so then we have at least

311
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:27,640
a starting point to start thinking about

312
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:28,990
how we're going to go about this so like

313
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,490
for example we could try to find this

314
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:32,740
malware do we have a forensics expert

315
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:34,630
online probably not

316
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:36,160
we can hire that out but is that the

317
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,689
best place to be put in our efforts

318
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,579
right now if we find the malware they

319
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:40,570
take a lot of a long time like I said if

320
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:42,250
we disconnect the internet we're

321
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:43,750
probably bringing down the business we

322
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,950
could disable users we know that users

323
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,870
are compromised we're not sure which

324
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:49,180
ones should we disable some of them

325
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:50,890
should we disable all of them list out

326
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:53,770
all of these actions that you can think

327
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:58,120
of and then list all the negative

328
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:59,290
outcomes that happen and figure out to

329
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,180
your best of ability because you're

330
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:04,089
gonna have to do this quick which ones

331
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:05,709
do you want to do so like I said we

332
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:08,230
could power down everything in corrupt

333
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:11,800
databases might happen we might be able

334
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:13,540
to recover we might not once you have

335
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,410
all these listed out make your decisions

336
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:17,300
and move

337
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:18,620
this is usually what we do so we're

338
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,540
gonna disable routing between the

339
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:22,580
environments log on your course which is

340
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,839
kill off anything that's um you know

341
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:25,460
depending on your network architecture

342
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,140
make sure that your environments are at

343
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:30,500
least isolated so you can't your

344
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:32,210
containing to spread it disable all your

345
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,590
domain accounts if you have domain

346
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,300
accounts are compromised chances are

347
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:38,180
they got domain admin account and your

348
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:41,449
entire domain needs to be burned send

349
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:42,739
people home this is an interesting one

350
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:44,270
because when you take away all the

351
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:47,210
computers anybody that's not essential

352
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:50,120
to the recovery or the continuing

353
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:52,220
operations send them home there's gonna

354
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,480
be a lot of people that want to help but

355
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,130
they're not gonna be able to help so

356
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,410
they're gonna just kind of get in the

357
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:59,300
way their intentions are good they just

358
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:01,360
don't have the skills or capabilities to

359
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:03,439
help send them home

360
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,720
side note there's something funny that

361
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,760
happens a rumor mill will begin I

362
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,140
guarantee it when you have a cyber

363
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,030
security attack and you're sending

364
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:12,800
people home as you recover the business

365
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:14,990
I can't tell you how many times I've

366
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,699
heard something like oh the Chinese or

367
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:18,770
the Russian or whatever hot in the news

368
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,510
right like oh yeah we saw a guy come in

369
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:23,540
he looked really Russian do you think he

370
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:25,939
was the attackers no it wasn't George

371
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:27,349
from accounting I guarantee it it's

372
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:29,150
because we had already P open to the

373
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:30,740
world it was definitely not the guy

374
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:32,650
coming into our office and planting

375
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:36,110
something doesn't happen with that right

376
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:38,480
last step is um number four get

377
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:40,370
management to figure out your BCP so

378
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,560
notice I didn't say there its BCP how do

379
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:44,870
we continue as a business without

380
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,520
technology we're gonna have to get

381
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:48,110
creative here but let management figure

382
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:51,470
that out while you're doing all the

383
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:53,210
recovery efforts what this results in is

384
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:54,980
an isolated area of an investigation and

385
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:57,230
recovery right so you're gonna have to

386
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:59,720
prioritize a lot of your work this gives

387
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:01,100
you at least a starting point of okay we

388
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,870
have this environment this environment

389
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:06,530
this bar and you can start focusing in

390
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:08,260
two areas so cool we turn off our core

391
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:10,000
routers we brought down the business

392
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:12,530
start the clock

393
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,870
does everyone out there know how long

394
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:17,360
their business can stay down without

395
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:20,180
declaring bankruptcy or making drastic

396
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,010
changes to the business if you don't

397
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:23,930
let's get some homework out there and

398
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:26,450
let's talk to the business to figure out

399
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:28,250
exactly how long a good starting point I

400
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:29,390
always recommend is two weeks especially

401
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:33,050
if it's Friday

402
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:35,720
cuz what happens every two weeks in most

403
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:38,270
businesses it's payday so if you can't

404
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,890
pay your employees chances are you're

405
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:42,829
gonna have big problems getting them

406
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:44,480
come back so at very very least it's

407
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:46,940
probably around two weeks it's probably

408
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,320
a lot closer to maybe three four days of

409
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,970
full production it's gonna vary

410
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,950
depending on the business and risk

411
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:53,720
models everything like that ask it

412
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:55,430
that's the business ask your senior

413
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,870
leadership how long can we keep this

414
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:58,969
business down it's a good conversation

415
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:03,620
to have now rather than when you're on

416
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:05,390
fire so cool business is down what's the

417
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:07,100
next step so we gotta figure out how

418
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:09,650
we're gonna fix this place right so we

419
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:12,740
first have to know what's broken how bad

420
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:14,050
is it what do we need to fix and what do

421
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,580
we need to fix first

422
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:17,800
so what's broken that's the first

423
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:20,420
question that we gotta ask ourselves

424
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,760
be careful with this this question makes

425
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:24,920
sense to you and me this question is

426
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:27,200
very dangerous when you ask other people

427
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,969
we think like yeah we need to know

428
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,160
what's broken so we know what to fix

429
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:32,420
this is what the answer you get though

430
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,270
when you talk to somebody in this

431
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:37,510
situation it's bad right everything's

432
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:41,150
down we can't even talk to people like

433
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:43,430
that's not useful I did sneak out a

434
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:44,930
video from one of my clients in the

435
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:46,880
boardroom when we asked this question

436
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:48,469
accidentally before I changed up my tack

437
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,720
a little bit this is exactly what they

438
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:52,790
looked like right so it's it's not a

439
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,350
good question don't ask that turn the

440
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:56,780
phrase a little bit to something that is

441
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:58,220
useful to management what do we need to

442
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:00,350
do to stay in business that's a much

443
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:02,450
better question that's something that

444
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:03,980
they can chew on they're gonna go away

445
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:05,660
and they're gonna come back with their

446
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,710
answer and it's gonna look something

447
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,750
like this

448
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:10,760
it's going very business-to-business

449
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:13,130
service versus production manufacturing

450
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,870
kind of thing but it's going to be

451
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:18,500
something like this we take in requests

452
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:19,940
we do something to fill the requests we

453
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,740
receive payments and we pay bills

454
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:25,940
that's the business cycle that's how

455
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:29,540
businesses work so cool we know how we

456
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:31,830
make money now how do we do those things

457
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:33,750
from a technology standpoint

458
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:35,670
so red teamers in the room this is where

459
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:38,040
you come into play we are on a black box

460
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:39,780
pen test basically blue teamers in room

461
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,640
if you don't know how to run an nmap

462
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:44,850
skin figure it out

463
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:48,060
go take any type of very basic intro to

464
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:50,760
enumerations and just get this in your

465
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:52,079
tuba because at this point we're not

466
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,980
sure how to put Humpty Dumpty back

467
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,720
together again

468
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:57,270
we have no system documentation we have

469
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,490
nothing things are kind of running we

470
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:01,020
need to know what's talking to what what

471
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:04,020
should be talking to what what service

472
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:05,940
do we have go find any information that

473
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,470
you can find from anywhere right we're

474
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:09,750
talking about any documentation it can

475
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:11,310
pull up network logs run your end map

476
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:14,030
scans right we're looking at system

477
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:16,230
configurations pull out the microfiche

478
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:18,060
who's here has worked in a datacenter

479
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:20,459
with a raised floor grab the suction

480
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:21,690
cups pull off the tiles see underneath

481
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:25,950
the floor if there's any documentation

482
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:27,420
no joke found a dr hole binder right

483
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:28,920
under the floor it was sitting there for

484
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,750
three years it was actually pretty

485
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:34,800
useful because the critical services

486
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:36,360
here's a here's a protip so if you want

487
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,430
to find the most critical service in

488
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,080
your business find this system that is

489
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:41,370
not patched everybody's afraid to bring

490
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,679
it down they're afraid to touch it that

491
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:44,969
is probably the most critical server so

492
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,980
documentation from three to five years

493
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:48,870
ago probably really similar to the

494
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:51,810
current configure all right grab

495
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:54,330
anything that you could find put that up

496
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:55,770
on a white board what we want to do is

497
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:58,169
figure out how these things are

498
00:17:55,770 --> 00:18:00,900
interacting with each other what is

499
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:03,690
doing what what do we need to go do our

500
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:06,780
business cycle and what your end up with

501
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:09,240
is an architecture and you make oh I'm

502
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:10,590
starting to understand it it's kind of

503
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,910
like one of those optical illusion

504
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,740
pictures where you stare at it for a

505
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:15,360
long time and eventually the picture

506
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:18,060
this jumps out at you this is what's

507
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,169
gonna happen the problem is this is what

508
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:21,060
it's going to look like to you in your

509
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:22,980
head this is what you look like to

510
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:24,750
everybody else in your organization you

511
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,820
are a crazy person right you're the

512
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:28,559
madman so we need to organize these

513
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,850
thoughts in a little bit

514
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:33,620
another business pro tip if you want

515
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:35,969
anything done put it in a spreadsheet so

516
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:37,408
now we know what our critical functions

517
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:39,840
are right we need to take orders we need

518
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:41,759
to make products blah blah blah and we

519
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,639
know what systems we need to do those

520
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:46,440
critical functions then we're going to

521
00:18:44,639 --> 00:18:49,439
list out the various steps of our

522
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:51,360
restore and then we're gonna color code

523
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,789
it why do we color code it so management

524
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,889
knows if it's good or bad what we want

525
00:18:53,789 --> 00:18:58,590
to do is limit the amount of interaction

526
00:18:55,889 --> 00:19:01,860
that is required from us to management

527
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:04,110
our job is to focus uncover ease not on

528
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:05,668
communications the worst thing that

529
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,769
could happen is you have an executive

530
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:09,299
breathing down your deck asking why is

531
00:19:07,769 --> 00:19:11,429
it not done why is it not done why is it

532
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:13,860
not done and all you do is spend time

533
00:19:11,429 --> 00:19:15,480
doing status updates if you have this

534
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,699
type of leadership make sure you assign

535
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,779
somebody to be the communications lead

536
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:21,869
that is collecting all this information

537
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:24,450
and managing that something that we've

538
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:27,178
done in the past is get this recovery

539
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:29,460
matrix up on a TV or projector and put

540
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:31,080
it outside of your war room so if people

541
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:34,289
are curious on the status they can walk

542
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:36,509
by and they say green or red they know

543
00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:37,860
what's working what's not as things go

544
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,990
more green they know you're making

545
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:41,639
progress it's a very easy way to keep

546
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:46,769
yourself isolated to your work and

547
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:48,508
everybody else is informed so how do we

548
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:50,549
restore this now back to the technicals

549
00:19:48,509 --> 00:19:53,340
so we know we have a whole bunch of

550
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:55,649
systems that are down and we need to

551
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:57,869
bring them back going back to step zero

552
00:19:55,649 --> 00:20:01,110
and breathing and thinking through this

553
00:19:57,869 --> 00:20:08,809
we cannot risk a reinfection so we're

554
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:10,248
gonna restore to a quarantine zone so

555
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:11,539
we know where you have a backup system

556
00:20:10,249 --> 00:20:14,570
we're gonna connect it to the quarantine

557
00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:16,759
zone and we're going to then restore to

558
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:19,490
a new network there's one problem with

559
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:21,019
this diagram I told you that the most

560
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:22,039
critical systems aren't touched and

561
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:23,720
they're not patched and probably

562
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:26,600
susceptible the same thing includes your

563
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:29,269
backup system backup systems that are

564
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,580
online chances are a running legacy code

565
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:34,100
as nobody wants update them they're

566
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:35,809
going to be affected as well all your

567
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,428
online backup systems are most likely

568
00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:40,940
going to be affected by the ransomware

569
00:20:37,429 --> 00:20:46,549
or the destruction attack so now do we

570
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:50,210
do that's right we go to offline backups

571
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:53,720
we go to our tape now tape is a naughty

572
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:55,899
word NIT because it's old and slow so

573
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:58,820
I'll replace tape with offline backups

574
00:20:55,899 --> 00:21:00,768
if your backups if you have it like a

575
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:02,509
3-node backup system or you have an

576
00:21:00,769 --> 00:21:04,789
active active passive and they're online

577
00:21:02,509 --> 00:21:07,340
they are susceptible to destruction

578
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:09,769
attacks you need to make sure to have

579
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:11,330
offline backups so if you don't have

580
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:13,700
offline backups here's some more

581
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:16,039
homework go talk to your IT organization

582
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:18,230
and figure out why you don't have

583
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:22,820
offline backups and present this use

584
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:24,440
case to them so we are going to build a

585
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:26,389
new backup system and we're gonna

586
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,580
rebuild our backup catalog from our

587
00:21:26,389 --> 00:21:30,769
tapes from our offline discs from

588
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:33,710
whatever we have and then we're going to

589
00:21:30,769 --> 00:21:35,990
move into the quarantine system so what

590
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:37,610
do we need in a quarantine to make sure

591
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:41,809
that what we're restoring is not

592
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:45,080
infected yep I heard air gaps

593
00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:46,940
I heard monitoring and alerting right so

594
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,740
we need to understand exactly what's

595
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:50,179
happening in there so this thing is air

596
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,230
gaps and I don't mean air gapped in

597
00:21:50,179 --> 00:21:52,639
network segmentation

598
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:55,070
I mean air gapped air gapped this is

599
00:21:52,639 --> 00:21:57,229
going into a different rack this has no

600
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:58,700
communications outside if you have pizza

601
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:02,350
box servers you are physically moving

602
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:05,090
them we cannot risk a reinfection

603
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:07,908
company is gone if we get reinfected at

604
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:10,249
this point because you're probably 70 to

605
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:12,019
96 hours into the incident right now and

606
00:22:10,249 --> 00:22:14,629
you're starting finally to make progress

607
00:22:12,019 --> 00:22:16,159
if you kneecap your progress with an

608
00:22:14,629 --> 00:22:18,168
infected system into your new network

609
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:21,019
you have to restart the clock again and

610
00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:22,620
if you're going on day five day six of

611
00:22:21,019 --> 00:22:25,080
bringing back the business you have to

612
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:26,580
we start from day zero and you might

613
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:30,030
have just lost your chance to save this

614
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:32,970
company so we are doing this the right

615
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:34,980
way we are air-gapped we're to monitor

616
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:36,660
for iOS and iOS these indicators of

617
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:39,720
attacks indicators are compromised make

618
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:41,550
sure that you have a clean system and

619
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:44,430
clean data before you move into new

620
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:48,419
network so notice I keep saying new

621
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:50,309
network not production this is because

622
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:53,970
another cool thing happens when you have

623
00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:55,350
a B word in your environment all of a

624
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:56,940
sudden the security budget goes out the

625
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:59,250
window and you have a blank check

626
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:01,020
now that blank check expires in about 90

627
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:02,460
days when everybody forgets about

628
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,080
security and then you have to go fight

629
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,400
tooth and nail for your budget again

630
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,909
we'll talk about that in a little bit

631
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:10,530
but right now we have a blank check we

632
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:13,020
have authorization to do whatever we

633
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:14,940
want no change control no nothing

634
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:18,980
because the business is down right so

635
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:18,980
what do we want in our new network

636
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:25,900
okay I am I am is a good example right

637
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:28,030
so we can do role based access controls

638
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:30,220
right we can make sure that Sallie Mae

639
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:32,830
in accounting doesn't have access to the

640
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:34,300
payroll systems you know the data to

641
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:36,100
manipulate social security numbers and

642
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:39,790
that said we can isolate there it might

643
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:42,909
take a long time but we could do that

644
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:45,100
yes network segmentation perfect example

645
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:47,740
so network segmentation would help us

646
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:49,990
because if the adversaries come back and

647
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:52,540
they will they will have less of an

648
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:53,440
impact on the next compromised how are

649
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,670
we going to know about the context

650
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,770
compromise we wouldn't have monitoring

651
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:58,750
and learning systems go grab a log

652
00:23:56,770 --> 00:24:00,340
aggregation in a sim or something like

653
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:03,670
that you it doesn't need to be world

654
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:07,149
class it needs to be something what

655
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:09,340
about her domain we know the domain was

656
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:10,870
popped they spread everywhere using a

657
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:12,220
domain admin account that was probably

658
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:16,060
your backup service account or something

659
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:18,280
like that right so how do we trust this

660
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,879
domain was the domain set up securely in

661
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,220
the first place

662
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:24,160
what if we just burned the domain stood

663
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:25,360
up a new domain if we could do things

664
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:27,850
the right way because we're gonna bring

665
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,110
this system back up incremental e so we

666
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:34,480
can do things the right way

667
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:36,149
burn the domain stand up a new domain so

668
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:40,120
here's another couple other things right

669
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:42,570
firewalls don't think of your old a sa

670
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:45,729
as a firewall we need layer seven now

671
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:47,860
that's great you have port 53 open to

672
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:50,200
the world and the data is being

673
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:52,449
encrypted and extolled over for port 53

674
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,100
though you're not gonna see that on an

675
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:56,230
old-school firewall get layer seven in

676
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,639
there you're most likely in this

677
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:59,590
situation cuz you forgot the patch go

678
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,000
get a patch management get vulnerability

679
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:04,389
scanners understand where your problems

680
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,310
are like I said the adversaries will

681
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:11,770
come back how many of you have kids out

682
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:13,929
there if you give a kid a toy and then

683
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:15,220
take the toy away that's the only thing

684
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:17,750
the kid is going to focus on just

685
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:18,830
getting that toy back

686
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:21,080
we just took away a toy from the

687
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:23,000
adversary they want their toy back they

688
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,520
are coming back be prepared next time

689
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,290
get an IR toolkit in an EDR solution

690
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:32,090
something like that give it to put in

691
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:34,430
your environment proxies right filter

692
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:35,720
out all of your outbound traffic through

693
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:37,160
a proxy make sure people aren't going to

694
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,530
malicious stuff make sure they're not

695
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:41,380
receiving malicious emails make sure

696
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:43,879
that you have some type of email but

697
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:46,250
you'll notice that we're talking about

698
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:48,050
the fundamentals of a security or right

699
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:50,720
you're gonna have to work hard on this

700
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:52,280
get this in as best as possible before

701
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,870
you turn the business back on you're

702
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:56,120
gonna have a long road ahead of you but

703
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:57,679
get the fundamentals in while the

704
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:00,080
business is down while you have that

705
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:02,390
blank check so when the adversaries do

706
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,250
come back in two to three weeks you can

707
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:09,260
you know you can stand a chance against

708
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:10,660
them so we kind of had a plan now we're

709
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:15,260
starting to bring the business back up

710
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:17,390
when do we stop and this is an important

711
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:19,190
thing because we're gonna be working our

712
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:22,400
tails off no sleep

713
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:24,110
when can we stop doing it so there's a

714
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,670
few criteria you can talk about can you

715
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:28,820
perform your critical functions can the

716
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:30,080
business operate how much longer can you

717
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,550
keep the business down maybe the

718
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,080
business can stay down an extra two days

719
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:34,669
and you can put the sim in before you

720
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,649
turn the business back up maybe the

721
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:38,690
business is thirty minutes away you need

722
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:41,660
to turn it on right now and the best you

723
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:45,110
could do is firewall off the production

724
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:47,690
from the QA systems fine understand your

725
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:48,860
constraints from a business and then

726
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:51,350
personally sue how much can you do

727
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:53,959
without sleep you can't you can't afford

728
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:56,000
a mistake how much it like sleep

729
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,710
deprivation is a real thing think about

730
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,170
that think about all your constraints

731
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:03,500
and then define the point on yes we can

732
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:04,550
move to a Phase two of recovery to find

733
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:07,460
these conditions ahead of time so you're

734
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:09,440
not doing it in there the excellent we

735
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:11,510
have this coming up we hold our lessons

736
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,760
learned here's a couple things that we

737
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:15,620
found that was kind of miscellaneous

738
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:18,149
outside of technical stuff

739
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:21,000
three two one rule of conferences

740
00:27:18,149 --> 00:27:23,309
maintain in this incident three hours of

741
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,840
sleep two meals a day one shower try to

742
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:26,960
do that as best as possible

743
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:29,279
your royal room will smell terrible

744
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,990
you're gonna have three day old chicken

745
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,789
nuggets over in the corner you're gonna

746
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:35,909
have empty coffee cups all over the

747
00:27:32,789 --> 00:27:38,309
place um you know where D is Jim how

748
00:27:35,909 --> 00:27:39,929
about John John over and I T spilt a

749
00:27:38,309 --> 00:27:40,408
whole thing of barbecue sauce on the

750
00:27:39,929 --> 00:27:41,700
table

751
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:45,990
we haven't cleaned that up yet it's

752
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:48,179
gonna smell awful on that note a sign a

753
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:50,970
war room manager have somebody managing

754
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:53,970
the food orders all of the documentation

755
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:55,919
collection on the the scheduling this

756
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:58,529
person needs to be a master organizer

757
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,850
and a master coordinator have somebody

758
00:27:58,529 --> 00:28:02,340
taking care of this stuff so you can

759
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:04,260
focus on your work save absolutely

760
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:07,320
everything hard drives are cheap go to

761
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:09,029
Best Buy buy all of them save everything

762
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:11,189
that you can pull off all the images

763
00:28:09,029 --> 00:28:13,830
you're never certain during the incident

764
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:15,389
we're gonna need three months you know

765
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:17,928
six months nine months in the future

766
00:28:15,389 --> 00:28:20,729
save everything disc is cheap

767
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:23,250
the last part here in sirs ensure the

768
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:24,750
secure auto bands communications the

769
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:28,049
last thing you want to do is bring up

770
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:30,750
the business you didn't rebuild exchange

771
00:28:28,049 --> 00:28:32,549
the adversary has hooks in exchange and

772
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:34,830
you're sending new credentials over and

773
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:37,168
then at that point you wouldn't get

774
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:38,789
compromised again don't do that ensure

775
00:28:37,169 --> 00:28:44,250
that you have a plan to get out of band

776
00:28:38,789 --> 00:28:47,899
of your corporate communications cool

777
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:51,510
we got the business back it was rough

778
00:28:47,899 --> 00:28:53,399
so how do I never do that again I never

779
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:57,960
never never want to be in that situation

780
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:59,428
again well we're gonna kind of talk

781
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:02,159
about where we're weak and how do we

782
00:28:59,429 --> 00:29:04,380
prioritize we kind of know where we're

783
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:06,120
weak cuz we probably plug that gap but

784
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,950
how do we figure out where else we're

785
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,330
weak right we're into a gap analysis

786
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:11,669
we're gonna figure out exactly where we

787
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:13,080
are we're gonna define reality we're

788
00:29:11,669 --> 00:29:15,750
gonna talk about what all of our

789
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:18,090
problems are then we're going to find

790
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:19,260
where we want to be this is where we

791
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:21,629
need to be from a business standpoint

792
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:24,419
this is where we're at we're gonna

793
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:26,940
roadmap how do we get there we're gonna

794
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:29,390
go from trawling to walking to running

795
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:31,340
to becoming that Olympic athlete

796
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:33,200
here's the steps that we need to do it

797
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:34,820
that's our jobs as security

798
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,070
professionals to define all that work

799
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:40,340
out and explain exactly what this is

800
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:41,540
gonna do for the business so we know

801
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:43,280
where we're at we just rebuilt

802
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:46,070
everything where we're at stage zero

803
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:47,600
where do we want to be don't think too

804
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:50,570
hard about this one go steal somebody's

805
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:53,230
framework these people are paid to think

806
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:55,610
about this stuff and develop digestible

807
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:56,929
information digestible I'll put in

808
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:59,799
quotes because some of these documents

809
00:29:56,929 --> 00:30:02,299
are really really tough to get through

810
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:05,389
so I've done a little bit of legwork for

811
00:30:02,299 --> 00:30:08,030
you I have this published out on the

812
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:10,760
active defense website if you want

813
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:14,540
source code just come on and talk to me

814
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:16,400
I have it in Visio and Adobe so just

815
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:18,100
send me a DM however you would like I

816
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:20,630
can get this over to you so you can

817
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:24,080
tweak it to whatever you need but

818
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:28,340
essentially this is NIST 853 broken out

819
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:31,428
to a one-page very simple to understand

820
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:33,290
framework so there's statements in here

821
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:35,540
called change control processes are in

822
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:38,090
place now if you go to NIST that's like

823
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:39,620
three paragraphs this is my framework is

824
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:41,090
very easy to understand that's what you

825
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:43,129
need to get in front of your management

826
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:45,860
in front of your executives the higher

827
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:47,360
you go up in the chain the less time you

828
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:48,918
have to interact with him you need to

829
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,240
distill this to the absolute

830
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:53,870
fundamentals on what you're talking

831
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:57,470
about so we're gonna list out all of our

832
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:58,520
controls well zoom up on one of these so

833
00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:00,919
we're gonna list out on all these

834
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:03,470
controls and then we're gonna select

835
00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:06,230
where we think we need to be for the

836
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:07,520
business so physical devices are

837
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:10,070
inventoried that's an example of a

838
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:12,168
control statement on the LAT top left

839
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:15,350
you see that the IT organization is

840
00:31:12,169 --> 00:31:16,549
going to own this and on the right the

841
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:18,139
top right you have asset management

842
00:31:16,549 --> 00:31:21,110
that's gonna be the security portfolio

843
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:22,210
that's governing this control down at

844
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:24,918
the bottom we have on through five

845
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:26,360
anybody that has their sis P or been

846
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:29,419
through any management training you know

847
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:31,729
this as the CMMI this is a very simple

848
00:31:29,419 --> 00:31:33,950
way to judge where you're at where you

849
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:35,660
want to be and then kind of give

850
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:37,340
management something to chew on so if

851
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:41,080
we're at a two and we want to get to a

852
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:41,080
three what we need to do is in

853
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:48,330
I'm going to improve from a2 to a3 it'll

854
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:49,679
be $80,000 now your management doesn't

855
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:50,879
have to think about the technicals they

856
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,559
think about the numbers and they have

857
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:56,039
something to justify to others that are

858
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:57,480
outside of our scope right the pro tip

859
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:59,190
here is don't make everything a 5 you

860
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,360
will be spending more money than you

861
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:02,549
should be if you make everything a 5

862
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:05,309
every dollar spent on security is a

863
00:32:02,549 --> 00:32:08,190
dollar not spent on the business making

864
00:32:05,309 --> 00:32:09,750
more money right so we are a cost center

865
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:11,130
unless we're selling security right but

866
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:13,470
for the most part we're a cost center we

867
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:15,870
want to be able to be responsible with

868
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:18,179
the investors money it's not to say that

869
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:20,580
we go really cheap on everything it's we

870
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:23,190
do what makes sense so if we write is

871
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:25,590
zero let's say Oh real quick if you

872
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:27,270
haven't seen the CMI this is kind of

873
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:30,000
what it looks like and again it's a

874
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:32,340
whole bunch of words I kind of distill

875
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,370
these down into a simple question so you

876
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:38,820
have 1 through 5 ad-hoc repeatable

877
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:39,750
defined managed and optimized one is an

878
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:42,000
ad-hoc process

879
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:45,120
so does personal judgment determine the

880
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,130
outcome if yes you're at a one number

881
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,979
two is repeatable like we know what we

882
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:51,510
need to do as a team it's not good it's

883
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,890
not document anymore we don't have a

884
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:55,289
process but we know what we're going for

885
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:58,350
and if I asked two people they probably

886
00:32:55,289 --> 00:33:00,510
do the same thing you know without any

887
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:03,149
judgment coming in number three is it's

888
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:04,890
a fine process right I can give this to

889
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:08,969
a team and everybody's going to get the

890
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:11,250
exact same outcome number four is there

891
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:13,230
is something governing this process and

892
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:15,390
we have exception management in place so

893
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:17,669
systems are running well if something

894
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:19,679
goes out of the normal we know that and

895
00:33:17,669 --> 00:33:21,539
then we react to it number five is

896
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:23,460
continued improvement all right so

897
00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:25,408
that's your CMMI that capability

898
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:26,970
maturity model and you're gonna go

899
00:33:25,409 --> 00:33:28,140
through and write all these so we know

900
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:29,850
we're at zero we don't have asset

901
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:32,220
management right now so we're off the

902
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:36,090
charts we need to figure out something

903
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:38,730
we think a defined process is a good you

904
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:41,520
know first step into this so how do we

905
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:42,750
go from a zero to a three well we're

906
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:45,059
gonna have an asset management program

907
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:46,770
and we're going to implement a system to

908
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:48,539
track assets in the environment both

909
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:50,279
physically and logically right we're

910
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:51,480
going to make we're gonna find out when

911
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:53,309
we purchase it we're gonna have all the

912
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,960
quotes in there and then so the final

913
00:33:53,309 --> 00:33:57,100
point on when we dispose of it and we

914
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,780
sell it off we're going to manage

915
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:00,570
that entire area and we're gonna have

916
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:03,220
the documentation we're gonna have IDs

917
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:06,189
model numbers support dates all that

918
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:07,870
stuff in here and we believe that if we

919
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:11,139
do this successfully we will be at a

920
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:14,469
three so we're gonna go do that for

921
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:16,510
every single control chart and what

922
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:18,939
we're gonna end up with is or gonna be

923
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:21,639
like oh we can see these six controls

924
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:23,710
can be met by this one project and we

925
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:25,690
start organizing stuff based on this and

926
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:28,240
what you end up with is a project

927
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:29,379
portfolio here's a couple examples right

928
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:31,330
you're gonna have asset management you

929
00:34:29,379 --> 00:34:33,580
got I am you're gonna incident response

930
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:34,989
but what you're gonna do is have all of

931
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:36,879
this work laid out for you

932
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:39,908
so you can start divvying it out to

933
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:41,859
other teams so they can go tackle it but

934
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:45,780
you say right whiz there is a bunch of

935
00:34:41,859 --> 00:34:48,340
work here what what do we do first

936
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:51,399
so this is where threat modeling kind of

937
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:52,540
comes in right so threat modeling to us

938
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:54,879
you know we have all these different

939
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:57,369
diagrams if entity relationships we have

940
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:59,049
cause effect we have fish bones we can

941
00:34:57,369 --> 00:35:00,730
go through and start defining all these

942
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:02,230
things out we can look at the diagram of

943
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:06,609
geopolitical relations in the Middle

944
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:09,190
East and we just got popped by I'm a

945
00:35:06,609 --> 00:35:11,580
17-10 we just got popped by Oh 867 we

946
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:17,200
are not ready to talk about geopolitical

947
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:18,840
relationships right make it simple there

948
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,640
are bad things that can happen

949
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:23,500
we have controls in place to stop those

950
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:26,170
bad things from happening and we have

951
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:30,190
things that we're trying to protect just

952
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:33,430
start here keep it simple

953
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:35,170
so textbooks will tell you on how to

954
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:37,569
prioritize all your stuff is lost

955
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:38,950
expectancy you put the likelihood and

956
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:40,480
the impact you multiply them together

957
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:43,210
and you get this number called loss

958
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:45,400
expectancy if you graph these out on XY

959
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:48,280
z-- the top right are things that you

960
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:50,140
need to mitigate cause these things have

961
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:52,030
a high likelihood of occurring and it's

962
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:54,089
gonna hurt you as a business so those

963
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:56,319
are the things that you should do a

964
00:35:54,089 --> 00:35:59,200
problem with this model that I have is

965
00:35:56,319 --> 00:36:01,079
it does not take into consideration any

966
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,640
resource constraints that you might have

967
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:06,720
chances are for in these situations we

968
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:09,250
had resource concerns we can't go tackle

969
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,459
300 million dollars of security budget

970
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:13,900
right now right like it's not happening

971
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:16,599
so what I like to do is take this one

972
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:18,400
step further and call bang for buck so

973
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:20,589
we take that loss expectancy number that

974
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,900
we had and we put that on the y-axis but

975
00:36:20,589 --> 00:36:26,828
we implement a new x-axis called ease of

976
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:29,710
implementation now what you get is stuff

977
00:36:26,829 --> 00:36:32,079
that is super simple to fix that is high

978
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:34,000
value to the business that's up in the

979
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:36,040
top right is a no-brainer project these

980
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,730
are things like laps as everybody know

981
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:41,920
what lapses laps is local admin password

982
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:44,109
solution it's provided by Microsoft and

983
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:46,599
what it is is kind of a centralized

984
00:36:44,109 --> 00:36:48,460
management plate for all of your local

985
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:51,310
admin on all of your devices they can be

986
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:53,680
workstations servers and so like if you

987
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:56,410
don't have this chances are you have

988
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:59,500
company a twenty twenty exclamation as

989
00:36:56,410 --> 00:37:01,990
your local admin account on every single

990
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:03,790
one of your laptops and because your

991
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:05,560
helpdesk team needs access to all of

992
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:07,450
them they don't really get rotated so

993
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:10,480
maybe it's not 20/20 maybe it's 2016 a

994
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:13,750
nice time that was set right so what

995
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:16,210
laps does is it has a hook on to all of

996
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:18,060
your systems and it will automatically

997
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:20,920
rotate this password for you every time

998
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:22,569
you have a central management so your

999
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,690
helpdesk or your sis had mints can log

1000
00:37:22,569 --> 00:37:27,759
into a portal and it spits out the

1001
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:29,560
unique password so now if a laptop gets

1002
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,079
compromised and they have local admin

1003
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:34,540
they still are subjected to to that one

1004
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:37,480
asset they don't have local admin across

1005
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:39,040
your fleet so it's a no-brainer if you

1006
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:41,349
need help with a DME it's like three

1007
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:44,020
PowerShell commands in a make commits of

1008
00:37:41,349 --> 00:37:45,880
schema change and then you push a GPL

1009
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:47,410
super simple you can do your whole

1010
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:49,840
impact analysis get the sport done

1011
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:52,870
within eight hours no problem whatsoever

1012
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:54,880
that's a no-brainer top left is big

1013
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:56,950
projects these are things like zero

1014
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:59,230
trust architectures you know it's gonna

1015
00:37:56,950 --> 00:38:03,720
be super difficult but if you can get

1016
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:06,280
them done the mitigations are huge

1017
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:08,109
bottom right it's the one we have times

1018
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:10,510
they're easy to do they're not that big

1019
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:11,140
of a deal its cleanup efforts right so

1020
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:12,520
that's cool

1021
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:14,770
and then the bottom left are things that

1022
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:15,790
we're just gonna do alright these things

1023
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:17,950
are really hard to do and they don't

1024
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:19,840
provide much business to us so now we

1025
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:23,140
have some type of structure to start

1026
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:26,970
talking about priorities so cool we list

1027
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:29,170
these all out we prioritize now go do it

1028
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:31,089
start working through your punch list

1029
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:32,860
all right we're gonna obtain the

1030
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:34,960
resources to complete projects what do

1031
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:37,090
you need what do you need right we're

1032
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,620
gonna get the budget for any new

1033
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:40,840
implementation and then we're gonna

1034
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:42,730
start talking about how do we make

1035
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:45,940
progress on all this maybe we meet

1036
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:47,470
bi-weekly with project teams and we're

1037
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:49,630
gonna meet quarterly with our steering

1038
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:52,540
committee steering committee is made up

1039
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:54,310
of your executive leadership they have a

1040
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:55,870
stake in security but they don't know

1041
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:57,730
the technical details right but they

1042
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:59,890
should really have an input into what

1043
00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:01,960
you want to do first from a risk

1044
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:03,520
management perspective we're gonna

1045
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,870
reprioritize our projects based on

1046
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,090
business change climate change

1047
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:08,680
threatened escapes and we're gonna

1048
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:10,060
continue our gap analysis we're gonna

1049
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,919
figure out where else are we weak or

1050
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:13,420
where else do we want to improve we want

1051
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,970
to really really good at response

1052
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:18,250
because we know we can't do anything to

1053
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:20,620
protect this specific attack or maybe

1054
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:22,600
it's we don't have time to respond to

1055
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:24,580
everything we need to do the best we can

1056
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:26,380
with protection and then go get an

1057
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:27,790
instant response retainer to manage

1058
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:29,020
anything that gets through all right

1059
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:31,029
these are all decisions that you need to

1060
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:35,140
make and you're going to continue these

1061
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:37,540
analysis through and oh congratulations

1062
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:40,720
look yeah you're a see so right like

1063
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:43,750
we've accidentally became the security

1064
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:45,910
leader in the business um it's not a bad

1065
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:47,770
thing right poor Harold here he's not

1066
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:48,970
sure yet but it's a good thing right we

1067
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:50,920
are leaders in the security

1068
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:52,480
organizations we are leaders in the

1069
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:55,420
business we are the trusted adviser

1070
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,890
because we can explain things because

1071
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:58,990
we're keeping it simple cuz we're

1072
00:39:56,890 --> 00:40:00,549
relating it back all right um

1073
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:04,120
so all these things are really really

1074
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:06,790
good and they're very very stressful but

00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:12,220
need to do why we need to do it asking

00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:14,170
the right questions to get the right

1079
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:17,259
