1
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:55,150
and really looking forward to watching

2
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:58,420
those videos later but anyway Who am I

3
00:00:55,150 --> 00:01:01,120
my name is Stephen Briggs I am a senior

4
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,530
program manager for power operations

5
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,950
cybersecurity with the Tennessee Valley

6
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:09,310
Authority I've been doing cyber security

7
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:11,680
for about 11 years prior to that I spent

8
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:16,330
five years in the US Army and infantry

9
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:18,280
doing two tours to Iraq Tora Kosovo I'm

10
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:22,060
so got all of my physical security

11
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:25,360
experience there a lot of my foundations

12
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:28,060
for my cyber security philosophy from

13
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,720
the infantry but really learned a lot

14
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:34,149
and enjoyed my time in the service and

15
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,440
then I think it's also important to have

16
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:37,600
a little bit of background about what

17
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,710
you enjoy as a speaker so I'm a big

18
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,250
Dungeons & Dragons

19
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:45,970
fan player DM and are usually lawful

20
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:50,259
good I love to golf video games all that

21
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:53,020
fun stuff and then I'm on the Twitter so

22
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:55,360
you can find me at Tennessee Vols fans

23
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:58,360
twenty-nine try and post some funny

24
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:01,750
stuff follow a lot of smart people and

25
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,220
enjoy the info SEC Twitter community and

26
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,960
I'm also a big supporter of the mental

27
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,640
health hackers and innocent lives

28
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,728
foundation I think that those are both

29
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,470
two great charities out there I'm doing

30
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:14,019
a lot of good work for the hacker

31
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:17,109
community and then the innocent lives

32
00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:19,989
foundation tracking down child predators

33
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:22,810
and helping to expose them and work with

34
00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:24,730
law enforcement definitely a great

35
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:29,220
organizations to go check both of them

36
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:32,980
out so today we're going to be talking

37
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:34,930
about the government's view an

38
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:38,578
organization of critical infrastructure

39
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:41,260
this is more on the strategic planning

40
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:44,860
side of the house of cybersecurity and

41
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:47,590
this is not our ones and zeros talk but

42
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:49,930
I think it's a very important part of

43
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:52,000
security to understand because this is

44
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:54,880
you know the world that your executives

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,590
are planning what they're having to deal

46
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59,410
with as far as the government relations

47
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:00,190
go and then also just talk about you

48
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:03,130
know the way

49
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:05,680
the government is approaching this you

50
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:09,400
know what cybersecurity weaknesses there

51
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:12,760
are based on the individual sectors and

52
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,950
then really look at how critical

53
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:19,750
infrastructure to inter dependencies are

54
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:22,959
tied together to show what cybersecurity

55
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:24,130
risk there are and what operational risk

56
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:29,200
there are between the different

57
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:30,820
verticals so our agenda as I said I'm

58
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,260
gonna talk about the government's

59
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,840
definition of critical infrastructure

60
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,459
talk about those interconnected

61
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,830
interconnections and dependencies talk

62
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:41,200
about some high-level initial failure

63
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:43,350
scenarios and then talk about the

64
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,869
cascading failure potential between them

65
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:49,930
talking about how social disruption can

66
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:51,460
factor into that also a little bit about

67
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:53,470
the incident response differences

68
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:56,140
between an IT environment and you guys

69
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:57,870
suggest environment what is being done

70
00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:02,380
already and then what you should be

71
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:05,290
doing to be ready for all of this so

72
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:08,410
this year the u.s. Council of Foreign

73
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:10,480
Relations survey ranked a highly

74
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:13,060
disruptive cyberattack on us critical

75
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,310
infrastructure including the electorial

76
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,858
systems as the highest risk for 2020

77
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:19,988
that is above a large scale of physical

78
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:21,880
terrorist attack that is above war with

79
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:26,919
Russia North Korea or other name

80
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:28,690
conflict in the world and that you know

81
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:33,760
you would expect that to be you know

82
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:35,680
national media news you know on CNN and

83
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,620
all the other news agencies out there

84
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:43,360
that this is a big deal on the

85
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:45,370
government ranked it about ranked it

86
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,230
really high and you would have expected

87
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:49,630
you know there to be I guess more

88
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:51,400
discussion or more action and over this

89
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:53,110
year you really haven't seen much of

90
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:57,280
that even before Cove it and everything

91
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:58,630
good you didn't see a lot of change so

92
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,530
I'm gonna talk about a lot of the stuff

93
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:04,719
that's been gone on behind the scenes

94
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:06,940
and how that how you should be aware of

95
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,570
it what you can do with it but cyber

96
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:12,219
attacks against critical infrastructure

97
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:14,469
and IT infrastructure pretty much been

98
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,930
going on since 1982

99
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:18,370
they intensified in 2010 with the

100
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,170
Stuxnet attack on the Iranian

101
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:21,850
centrifuges so if you're you're

102
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:25,180
following that fun drinking game it's

103
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:29,040
once again been zero days since Stuxnet

104
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:32,220
was mentioned but you've seen cyber

105
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:36,010
attacks being used as precursors

106
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:39,430
alternatives and even armed conflict so

107
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:42,310
we saw it in 2019 with the cyber attack

108
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:44,310
against Iran to disable their ability to

109
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:48,340
attack oil tankers in the Persian Gulf

110
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:50,470
you've seen across the world attacks on

111
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:53,289
every US define critical infrastructure

112
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:55,210
in one way or another in all of these

113
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:58,150
cyber attacks on critical infrastructure

114
00:05:55,210 --> 00:06:00,729
can play a part of a conflict because

115
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:03,729
they go beyond system based cyber and

116
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:06,580
tech impacts they cross over into that

117
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:09,190
potentially causing loss of life when

118
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:11,050
you start impacting emergency services

119
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:14,350
when you impact the electric sector when

120
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:16,480
you impact the dam sector you start

121
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:18,880
getting into those impacts can kill

122
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:21,550
people and it gets serious real fast so

123
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:25,030
working for a power company I take my

124
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:26,590
mission very seriously it's you know the

125
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:29,799
motivation for me to get up every day

126
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:31,090
and go to work that I'm defending our

127
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,440
infrastructure I'm defending the

128
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,820
Tennessee Valley and I'm making sure

129
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:37,270
that the lights stay on and everything

130
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:38,830
runs the way it's supposed to be but I

131
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,780
also would say that you know I believe

132
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:43,390
that we've already had lost a loss of

133
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:46,150
lives due to ICS cyberattacks if we

134
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:48,400
attribute any deaths caused from the

135
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:51,010
cyber attacks and the blackouts in

136
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,469
Ukraine in 2015 I would probably list

137
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:56,140
some of those is the first so we just

138
00:06:53,470 --> 00:07:00,100
haven't seen I guess the world take that

139
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:03,099
view of it that cyber attacks can kill

140
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:05,890
people and it's something that we need a

141
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:08,230
kind of funnel any change our

142
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:10,450
perspective on I think we would get a

143
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:13,570
lot more support for critical

144
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:18,400
infrastructure defense and protection

145
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:18,730
programs but we have seen earlier this

146
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,270
year

147
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:26,800
the cyber stellarium Commission

148
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:27,669
published about 187 page report and this

149
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,470
was a rout

150
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:34,810
stuff in 2019 as a bipartisan Commission

151
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:37,060
14 members you have some really big

152
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:38,410
names on the government get the director

153
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,510
deputy director of national intelligence

154
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:43,540
that could be director Secretary of

155
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:46,560
Homeland Security second secretary

156
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:48,300
offense director yeah yeah I also have

157
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,040
[Music]

158
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:53,620
Tom Fanning the CEO of Southern Company

159
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:56,340
on this team and some great

160
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:58,710
representatives from our Congress and

161
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:02,560
House of Representatives on his team

162
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:05,940
that put in a lot of work really fast to

163
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,770
deliver this report when I first read it

164
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:12,760
the the first two pages or the first

165
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:16,990
three pages painted this extremely grim

166
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:18,789
picture about how overlapping critical

167
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:22,120
infrastructure failures and attacks from

168
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:25,450
cyber and physical means could really

169
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:30,010
you know push us to the apocalyptic end

170
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:33,250
of days type of scenario and this coming

171
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:35,950
out of a congressional route really kind

172
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:38,229
of surprised me I mean the the first two

173
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:40,570
pages really talk about commercial

174
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:42,130
enterprises going bankrupt you had water

175
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:43,330
treatment plants getting hacked so you

176
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:47,140
couldn't trust the water

177
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:49,030
you had DC being flooded from hacks on

178
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:51,580
the reservoir dams around there you had

179
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:54,069
delivery drones being delivery drones

180
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:57,640
and trains being hacked and used as

181
00:08:54,070 --> 00:09:00,430
rockets and missiles refugee camps had

182
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:03,069
stood up about there on the Capitol lawn

183
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:06,550
I mean it was a pretty dark picture and

184
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:08,890
I'm thinking to myself how is this

185
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:11,079
possible how would this be possible

186
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:13,150
I mean we we've said that you know

187
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:16,390
things are bad for over 20 years but

188
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:18,670
we've never said how bad and as Alyssa

189
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,930
said in the keynote you know we have to

190
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:23,170
show the data in the back of our

191
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:25,390
responses so we can't really know where

192
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:26,829
to protect critical infrastructure if we

193
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:29,770
don't know where we were all at right

194
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:32,020
now and the government you know has been

195
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:35,829
pushing through plans we push through

196
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:38,890
other directives every president you

197
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:41,180
know has had some impact on the cyber

198
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:44,430
space really the solarium Commission

199
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:46,199
is taking it to the next step my next

200
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:48,150
level they're trying to develop a

201
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,670
consensus strategy approach to defending

202
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:53,370
the u.s. cyberspace against cyber

203
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:55,319
attacks of significant consequence and

204
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:58,140
any attack on critical infrastructure

205
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:02,550
pretty much falls into that category of

206
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:05,610
having those significant consequences so

207
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:09,900
the government breaks down your critical

208
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:11,700
infrastructure in 16 sectors it's this

209
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:15,990
was done under the presidential policy

210
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:17,790
directive 21 again all government

211
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:20,160
documents are very long so I'm not gonna

212
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:21,660
go into a lot of depth on them really

213
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,600
just wanting to point out the key ones

214
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,490
that set the stage and are the building

215
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,360
blocks for how the government responds

216
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:33,210
and sets up oversight and coordination

217
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:36,180
collaboration with the agencies to the

218
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:39,270
private owned entities within these

219
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:40,859
verticals but this documents mission was

220
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:42,360
to strengthen the security or resilience

221
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,310
of the national critical infrastructure

222
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,620
by managing physical and cyber risk

223
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:48,930
through collaboration and integrated

224
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:55,050
efforts of the critical infrastructure

225
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:56,760
communities so these are the 16 sectors

226
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:58,560
and if you found yourself working in one

227
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,050
of these verticals most likely you've

228
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:04,920
been working in some capacity over the

229
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:07,620
code 19 pandemic all of these are what

230
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:11,790
the government considers the essential

231
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:15,000
sectors to make everything work they

232
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:17,209
have lots of interdependencies between

233
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,880
each other which we'll get into a minute

234
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:23,490
but even the way that the government

235
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,530
approaches critical infrastructure not

236
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:27,330
all of these are sheet in the same you

237
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:28,890
have the energy sector and the nuclear

238
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:32,010
generation sector that are heavily

239
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:33,930
regulated while the majority of the

240
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:36,030
other critical infrastructure had little

241
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:39,000
to no cybersecurity regulating

242
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:42,870
requirements and if any of these sectors

243
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,970
are attacked depending on how they could

244
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:48,050
have just as devastating impacts on

245
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:51,780
Americans lives and most of these

246
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:54,150
sectors the government is trying to

247
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:57,600
approach it through a voluntary

248
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:59,340
adoption and establishment of the

249
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,230
critical infrastructures to protect

250
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:03,750
their systems and we can't expect them

251
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:05,760
to all protect them to the same level or

252
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:08,850
even at all because it's voluntary if

253
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,010
it's not a cost benefit for these

254
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:13,470
privately owned companies then most

255
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:15,140
likely they're not going to do it so

256
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:18,300
that's again what I think going back to

257
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:22,110
what Alyssa talked about I really love

258
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:23,790
Burkina it was amazing you know you have

259
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:25,080
to establish you know the business

260
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:26,640
benefit for everything that you're

261
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:31,620
trying to do and the government has to

262
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:33,750
be this thing so going into the next

263
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:36,290
document you have a national

264
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:39,210
infrastructure protection point of 2013

265
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:42,180
this laid out a lot of the government

266
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:47,610
government agency oversight for who was

267
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:50,099
responsible for what sector the majority

268
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:52,530
of their responsibility falls to the

269
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,880
Department of Homeland Security so

270
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:56,270
they're responsible for things like the

271
00:12:53,880 --> 00:13:00,380
chemical sector commercial facilities

272
00:12:56,270 --> 00:13:02,550
communications critical manufacturing

273
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:05,400
but then you also get into some other

274
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:08,010
groups so they do e Department of Energy

275
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:10,380
has oversight over the energy sector

276
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:12,780
Department Treasury has oversight over

277
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,890
the financial sector Department of

278
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:16,350
Agriculture and Health and Human

279
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:19,290
Services our over the food and

280
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:21,450
agriculture sector so each different

281
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:22,709
vertical even within the Department of

282
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,120
Homeland Security you might be

283
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:28,740
interacting with an entirely different

284
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:30,450
apartment and say you know the

285
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:33,750
information technology compared to you

286
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:35,040
the nuclear reactor both under DHS both

287
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:38,250
are probably not talking to the same

288
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,380
people so the problem with this model is

289
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:43,380
that by separating the sector's there's

290
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:46,050
little research and planning done on the

291
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:48,300
interconnected issues between the sector

292
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:50,939
even the critical infrastructures that

293
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:55,079
are under one agency as I said are

294
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:58,380
probably managed by separate departments

295
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:01,020
additionally these sectors have limited

296
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:03,210
regulated requirements they have a lot

297
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:04,439
of safety and operation requirements so

298
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:07,580
you have the Environmental Protection

299
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:09,810
Agency putting out you know

300
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:13,830
rules and regulations to protect

301
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:16,530
environment you have health care that

302
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:18,600
has HIPPA and we'll talk a little bit

303
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:21,839
more about the breakdown of regulations

304
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,940
but overall you don't have a lot saying

305
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:26,250
specifically these are the cybersecurity

306
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:28,560
controls as a critical infrastructure

307
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:31,020
provider that you should have and that

308
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,729
is what I think is a leading cause of

309
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:35,760
causing a lot of problems and a lot of

310
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:37,590
insecurities because every report every

311
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,960
news broadcast every article that I've

312
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:41,760
ever seen has never once said critical

313
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,050
infrastructure safe everything's great

314
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,700
we're gonna have rainbows and kittens

315
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:47,310
and puppies and it's gonna be a great

316
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:49,260
day today tomorrow and next day you got

317
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:50,910
nothing to worry about whenever that

318
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,920
report comes out then I'll retired

319
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:55,050
because I won't have a job anymore but I

320
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,790
know that reports never gonna come we

321
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:59,099
can say the critical infrastructure is

322
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:02,790
vulnerable you know now until infinity

323
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:04,200
is just how vulnerable is the argument

324
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:07,849
and the discussion that we really need

325
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:11,360
to have so when we look at each sector

326
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:13,950
you can put them at the middle and show

327
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,860
everybody depends on the IT sector the

328
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:18,060
IT sector is all of your organizations

329
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,790
and companies that are produced from

330
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:24,089
hardware software information technology

331
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:26,099
systems and services but then you take

332
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:28,230
the internet which the government pushes

333
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,970
over to the communication sector which I

334
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:32,130
don't see how that works because you

335
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:33,900
can't have the internet without the

336
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:35,490
systems and services behind it to make

337
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:38,550
it work which I would assumed would have

338
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:40,200
all been in the IT sector so that's

339
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:41,609
where you start getting you know

340
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,230
different groups and different

341
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:46,140
departments and different things are

342
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:48,330
gonna give different rules so there's

343
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:50,870
not a clear division of oversight from

344
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:53,610
what you would have expected for example

345
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:56,910
if we look at like a cloud service and

346
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:59,520
the IT sector is this NIT or is this on

347
00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:02,100
communications both of these and all

348
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:03,660
those sectors have individual plans but

349
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:06,090
most of them haven't been updated in a

350
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:08,969
few years and Communications one hasn't

351
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:11,280
been aided since 2015 and the IT one

352
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:13,920
hasn't really been updated since 2060

353
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:17,400
but of these are really before the big

354
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,439
boom of like cloud services Internet of

355
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,340
Things all the new shiny stuff that

356
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,100
keeps coming out daily

357
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:25,840
so as these plans become stagnant you

358
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:29,590
know they start losing a lot of that you

359
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:32,320
know oversight an establishment of who's

360
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:34,750
responsible for what and new things are

361
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,940
just going to keep coming out but it's

362
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:38,770
even better instead of trying to put one

363
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:40,960
sector at the middle but to look at all

364
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:43,900
the sectors if you have starting to have

365
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:47,050
impacts on one you can have impacts on

366
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:50,439
all and all of us depend on each other

367
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:52,630
sectors are the electric sector depends

368
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:55,540
on emergency services if we have a fire

369
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:56,890
you know at one of our sites you know we

370
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:59,050
have a fire brigade and a lot of

371
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:00,730
utilities have fire brigades but that's

372
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:02,469
only a limited capacity we're still

373
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:05,650
gonna be calling emergency services to

374
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:07,360
come help with that and if they're you

375
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,920
know dispatch center or whatever is not

376
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,389
able to pick up the phone because

377
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:13,300
they've been hit with a ransomware

378
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:15,280
denial of service then we start you know

379
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:17,500
having constraints and you know

380
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,899
significant issues on our operations the

381
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:22,060
same with water supply we can't make

382
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,800
power without water we can't make water

383
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:25,990
without power you can't make power

384
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:28,510
without gas you can't make gas without

385
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:31,600
power so you get into this inter

386
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:33,820
dependency of where everything you know

387
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,770
you start hitting those dominant or you

388
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:37,659
start losing those capabilities you

389
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:44,320
start having a bad day really really

390
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:46,810
quickly why are adversaries going after

391
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:50,560
critical infrastructure well if you look

392
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:52,659
at Bianca's report that came out last

393
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:56,379
year where she laid out you know a lot

394
00:17:52,660 --> 00:18:00,220
of the highest ransomware payouts you

395
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:02,620
started seeing a lot of city compromised

396
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:05,350
estate services those emergency services

397
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:06,550
they were a prime target for ransom are

398
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:08,830
you seeing large health care

399
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:12,159
organizations as a prime target for her

400
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:14,230
for ransom wire because you know they're

401
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,940
they need those services up and running

402
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:17,590
you know we're not gonna stop you know

403
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:20,020
responding to fires and responding to

404
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:22,600
EMS calls and you know shutting down

405
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:25,480
hospitals we have to have those services

406
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:27,639
if they don't work then people die so

407
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,410
they're they're a prime target for your

408
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:32,470
cyber criminals out there that are just

409
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:35,440
trying to make a buck and they're going

410
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:36,669
to continue to be so they also

411
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,559
when you get into a critical

412
00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:40,330
infrastructure attacks you start having

413
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,100
physical impacts you know if you exceed

414
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:44,289
the safety operations and safety

415
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:46,959
measures on your equipment

416
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:49,210
through you know changing parameters

417
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,549
through cyberattacks you can start

418
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:53,259
blowing stuff up you can start having

419
00:18:51,549 --> 00:18:55,779
those physical impacts you can start

420
00:18:53,259 --> 00:18:58,149
having very devastating consequences

421
00:18:55,779 --> 00:19:01,929
that can kill people or you know

422
00:18:58,149 --> 00:19:03,758
permanently disrupt your service for a

423
00:19:01,929 --> 00:19:06,730
long time because a lot of the equipment

424
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:08,679
that we use isn't built in a day it's

425
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:12,220
generally you know very long lead time

426
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:13,990
so an attack can have very long lasting

427
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:16,360
impacts and then also if you start

428
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:18,850
hitting enough critical infrastructure

429
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:21,399
at the same time or you start hitting

430
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:24,820
those dependencies where you know if you

431
00:19:21,399 --> 00:19:27,100
hit a gas line or something in the

432
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:28,509
middle of January you know not only are

433
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:31,449
you shutting down power you're shutting

434
00:19:28,509 --> 00:19:34,200
down people's heat because we're running

435
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:36,789
a lot more and more off natural gas so

436
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,500
that starts becoming a significant

437
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:40,029
impact and when all of that starts

438
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:43,629
happening you start pushing the system

439
00:19:40,029 --> 00:19:45,250
towards the tipping point that we start

440
00:19:43,629 --> 00:19:49,689
getting into those anarchie type of

441
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:51,700
situations so as I spoke we're gonna go

442
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:54,429
through a couple of examples that are a

443
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:58,529
little bit more specific some real-world

444
00:19:54,429 --> 00:20:02,250
stuff that's happened so in 2019

445
00:19:58,529 --> 00:20:06,309
Chattanooga city of Chattanooga had a

446
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:08,980
primary water pipe burst wasn't because

447
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:11,379
of a cyber attack it was just they were

448
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:15,610
doing some construction there was a

449
00:20:11,379 --> 00:20:17,590
faulty too much pressure on the pipe or

450
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:19,269
something and it broke but it was the

451
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:21,939
primary feed for downtown Chattanooga

452
00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:25,929
and that shut down the city for three

453
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:28,629
days it shuts down because mainly a fire

454
00:20:25,929 --> 00:20:30,490
suppression if you can have sprinkler

455
00:20:28,629 --> 00:20:32,199
systems then your fire marshals

456
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:35,080
generally not gonna let you occupy the

457
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:38,470
building so this you know forced us to

458
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:40,570
say to activate all of our backup

459
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:42,279
recovery operations we had to move a lot

460
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:43,779
of our critical operations too often

461
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:46,059
into some of these that thankfully

462
00:20:43,779 --> 00:20:47,710
weren't across the street but we're on a

463
00:20:46,059 --> 00:20:49,550
different water supply in a different

464
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:52,460
facility that was far enough

465
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:54,530
that we were able to move our critical

466
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:56,600
operations over there and still you know

467
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:58,550
keep making power and making their

468
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:01,010
written work and making the transmission

469
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:02,780
grid work but we learned you know pretty

470
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:05,870
quick that we needed to have the

471
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:09,800
capability to send 4,000 or 5,000 people

472
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:12,409
home and work from VPN overnight with

473
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:17,149
little to no notice so it was a lot of

474
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:20,450
good prep we did a lot of good usage of

475
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:22,120
our emergency response processes so it

476
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:25,610
helped us shore up a lot of our

477
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:28,239
preparedness for things like Tobin so

478
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:30,649
when that happened you know we weren't

479
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,390
you know we we have been testing those

480
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:34,390
through drills and exercises but that

481
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:36,860
was a very good real-world example of

482
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:41,930
what we needed to do to be prepared to

483
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:46,100
work virtually so you also can use this

484
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:48,110
in events like it as starting blocks for

485
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:51,169
your drills and exercises change things

486
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:53,810
off of the happy path for how your

487
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:55,100
people would normally respond because

488
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:57,470
it's something that's totally out of

489
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,909
your control you can't plan for it and

490
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:00,470
probably aren't going to know when it

491
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:04,120
happens until the you know the water

492
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:07,130
doesn't turn on but it's something that

493
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:08,929
changes your perspective and changes

494
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:12,400
your response plan puts it in that gray

495
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:15,830
area to test something new and different

496
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,510
another example would be an attack on

497
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:19,310
the gas infrastructures so this was

498
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:21,860
something that we tested in the electric

499
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:26,240
sector's we have a national exercise

500
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:28,580
called grid X that's supported by the e

501
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,250
ice fact the electric sector information

502
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:33,460
sharing and analysis Center it has cross

503
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:36,080
collaboration amongst all of the major

504
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:39,140
utility providers out there all of your

505
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:42,610
municipalities and co-ops and five and

506
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:45,080
six hundred different organizations

507
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:47,870
participating a lot of government agency

508
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:50,240
support but what we tested out of that

509
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:52,129
was in grade five with some

510
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:56,780
collaboration or natural gas providers

511
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:59,690
and pipeline operators with a

512
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:02,690
significant portion of your electric

513
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:04,940
generation now depending on that natural

514
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:09,800
gasps just-in-time suppliers of critical

515
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:12,860
fuel this has become a very dependent

516
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,960
thing to make the grid work so if we

517
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:17,270
start having enough impacts on gas

518
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,100
supply you can start impacting the

519
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:21,350
reliability of the more electric system

520
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:23,090
you start impacting that you start

521
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:27,169
having the impacts like you saw with the

522
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:29,030
2003 blackout of New York you know mics

523
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:30,980
go off for a while they're not gonna

524
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:33,230
come back on for a while because it's

525
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:35,930
not an easy thing to restore that large

526
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:38,060
portion of the grid so those things that

527
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:40,010
we need to start have learning you know

528
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:41,720
we already knew that we needed to have

529
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:43,370
those conversations but it just kind of

530
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,320
gave us all in the data that we needed

531
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:48,739
it really you know structure that

532
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:50,750
conversation and understand that our

533
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:53,090
natural gas supply is a critical

534
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:55,780
priority we need to look at how that

535
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:59,810
supply makes it to the electric sector

536
00:23:55,780 --> 00:24:01,850
first so that we can keep you know the

537
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:04,639
lights on and at least we running

538
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:07,820
everything running that we can but it

539
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:10,100
was a very good test you know it's one

540
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:12,080
of those where it's not the electric

541
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:14,870
sector's ability to control we have no

542
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:17,090
way of managing the gas infrastructure

543
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:19,699
or the gas providers we're slowly

544
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:21,879
relying on them so without that

545
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:26,570
collaboration and discussion between us

546
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:28,550
and information sharing then we have a

547
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:30,290
lot of risk and that risk can continue

548
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:35,270
to grow as the dependency on natural gas

549
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:36,740
grows so if you're not in one of these

550
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:39,620
verticals you might be in one of the

551
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:42,080
other ones these are just some one line

552
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:44,750
first domino scenario examples of how to

553
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:49,159
introduce initial chaos in the critical

554
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:50,590
infrastructure they're plausible and

555
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:53,270
that's another thing that we have to

556
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:55,909
really concern ourselves with we can't

557
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:58,610
bring fear uncertainty and doubt we have

558
00:24:55,910 --> 00:25:01,640
to bring facts we have to bring data we

559
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:05,389
have to show you know how each one of

560
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:07,880
these types of attacks could impact

561
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:10,520
everything else and what will fall next

562
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,560
what will be the the downstream impacts

563
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:15,100
and we do this a lot through drills and

564
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:16,720
exercises but also learning from

565
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:20,320
the real-world examples that happen

566
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:22,090
across the world because these attacks

567
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,200
you know cyber attacks are happening

568
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:25,449
against a lot of critical

569
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,630
infrastructures and other countries you

570
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:30,190
have lots of things going on in Eastern

571
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:33,429
Europe lots of things like going on in

572
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:35,860
the Middle East a lot of things that you

573
00:25:33,429 --> 00:25:37,269
have to keep your eye out on and say

574
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:39,820
okay let's take this attack that

575
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:42,750
happened against Israel how would we

576
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:46,629
model that here where could that fit us

577
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:50,919
what can we learn from that so these are

578
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:52,779
just some so your ISPs you know all

579
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:54,580
being simultaneously hit with an

580
00:25:52,779 --> 00:25:57,370
effective cyber attack effective mean

581
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:59,559
keyword that completely blacks out the

582
00:25:57,370 --> 00:26:01,840
internet probably an extremely low

583
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:03,730
likelihood but high impact and that's

584
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,889
generally where these scenarios fall

585
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:07,419
they're very little likely and we have

586
00:26:05,889 --> 00:26:10,750
security controls in a lot of these

587
00:26:07,419 --> 00:26:13,330
cases but if they happen if they get

588
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:16,809
past those controls they are the big

589
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:20,289
impact types of scenarios so I would

590
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:21,970
call it a complete internet blackout so

591
00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:24,070
now everything that's running on a

592
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:27,220
corporate infrastructure that you don't

593
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:29,049
have independent backbones for that's

594
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:31,779
you know everything that's cloud-based

595
00:26:29,049 --> 00:26:33,190
is gone how much of that you know are

596
00:26:31,779 --> 00:26:37,200
you dependent on for your critical

597
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:40,450
operations you know can you get your

598
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:43,539
water sites or whatever or your electro

599
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:45,850
sites to talk if you're running on a

600
00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:49,029
verizon backbone or somebody else's

601
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:51,759
provider backbone you know what's your

602
00:26:49,029 --> 00:26:54,009
alternative so it's not again something

603
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:56,679
that's not probably in the verticals

604
00:26:54,009 --> 00:26:58,480
direct control but something that you

605
00:26:56,679 --> 00:27:00,820
know moves into that gray area of how do

606
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,769
you plan for an emergency that's not

607
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:05,950
your fault and it's not something under

608
00:27:02,769 --> 00:27:08,049
your your oversight but what is his

609
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:11,230
impacts the same that we've seen with

610
00:27:08,049 --> 00:27:12,158
emergency services dispatch as I said

611
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:14,379
they've been hit with a lot of

612
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,649
ransomware you've seen entire cities

613
00:27:14,379 --> 00:27:18,219
shut their city services shut down

614
00:27:16,649 --> 00:27:21,428
thankfully they had a lot of

615
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:24,010
alternatives to fall back on to keep

616
00:27:21,429 --> 00:27:27,029
things running but those are just kind

617
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:27,029
of continuing to happen

618
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:34,980
we saw you know just this week city of

619
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:37,050
Knoxville reportedly got hit by a

620
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:40,260
ransomware in their city service city IT

621
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:42,450
services were impacted so I mean that's

622
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:44,730
right up the road for me and it's really

623
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:48,480
close to home and you know it's still

624
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:51,240
concerning so then anyway you can also

625
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,970
look at movies you know while they're

626
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,590
the at rakul and you know everything

627
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:57,840
works and they just magically hit

628
00:27:55,590 --> 00:28:00,870
buttons on the computer and you know

629
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,760
they have the widespread impact I really

630
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:06,300
liked Fight Club I really liked die hard

631
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:09,930
I heard her the last one because I had

632
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:11,190
never heard the term firestorm until

633
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:14,340
that movie which I thought was really

634
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:16,100
interesting but just you know take you

635
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:19,050
know what is plausible out of those

636
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:22,770
movies and out of the those ideas and

637
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:26,220
then you know structure your your your

638
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:27,510
chaos plan to account for them and then

639
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:31,260
see what the impacts are on the

640
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:33,210
organization again we can also talk

641
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:37,320
about the truck and barge transportation

642
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:39,210
so as we've seen you have significant

643
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:41,100
supply shortages right now well what

644
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:44,990
would happen you know if the next domino

645
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:47,070
to fall in the 2020 game of chaos and

646
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:49,140
hunger games that we got going on right

647
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:51,480
now is the traffic of our transportation

648
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:53,580
gets it now I can't get my Amazon

649
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,710
delivery and I can't get anything else

650
00:28:53,580 --> 00:29:00,210
delivered and we start having you know

651
00:28:55,710 --> 00:29:03,090
entire shopping malls and grocery stores

652
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:06,570
and everything have no supplies then

653
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:09,480
what happens then you have people in

654
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:11,610
your operations that are having to

655
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,350
determine okay am I gonna go home and

656
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:17,040
take care of my family or am I gonna go

657
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:20,100
to work it starts getting into those

658
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:22,230
types of complicated scenarios also our

659
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:24,780
healthcare system is currently you know

660
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:26,580
extremely strained with kovat response

661
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:29,490
and everything else that's been delayed

662
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:32,490
as far as preventive care and elective

663
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:34,590
care what if that got hit with you know

664
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:36,240
a heart rate monitor system you know

665
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:38,490
malicious worm that went through and

666
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,080
destroyed all that well now all of your

667
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:41,190
nurses and doctors are having to go

668
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,470
through and do

669
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:45,239
you know checks on every patient every

670
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:46,919
five to ten minutes because they're

671
00:29:45,239 --> 00:29:49,200
required to and that's what's keeping

672
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:52,080
that patient alive and now you just

673
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,059
strain that system even more so these

674
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,549
are the things that you know you start

675
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:58,139
lying on the dominoes up and then you

676
00:29:56,549 --> 00:30:00,029
start seeing where you fit on that

677
00:29:58,139 --> 00:30:02,639
Domino chain and you start having those

678
00:30:00,029 --> 00:30:04,440
discussions of how do I keep these

679
00:30:02,639 --> 00:30:06,599
events and these attacks from impacting

680
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,440
us what are we gonna do to respond how

681
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:09,330
are we gonna do

682
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,099
what are we gonna do different remains

683
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:15,928
get worse because things can always get

684
00:30:11,099 --> 00:30:17,189
worse but those types of discussions so

685
00:30:15,929 --> 00:30:19,859
if you've never worked in critical

686
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:22,409
infrastructure have lived in the IT

687
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:23,699
world there's a few differences that you

688
00:30:22,409 --> 00:30:26,309
need to know as far as your incident

689
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:27,899
response goes one you probably don't

690
00:30:26,309 --> 00:30:30,418
have physical or logical access to these

691
00:30:27,899 --> 00:30:32,570
systems generally your ot your

692
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:34,919
operations technology environment

693
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:36,570
hopefully is somewhat segmented from

694
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:38,909
your IT environment you're not running

695
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:42,299
on the same corporate Active Directory

696
00:30:38,909 --> 00:30:45,029
server because that's just Adam just an

697
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:47,249
easy easy target it makes it easier for

698
00:30:45,029 --> 00:30:49,259
your attackers to jump through the IT

699
00:30:47,249 --> 00:30:50,789
infrastructure to get to your ot

700
00:30:49,259 --> 00:30:53,239
infrastructure and start doing really

701
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:57,599
bad things on your critical operations

702
00:30:53,239 --> 00:30:59,580
so figure out you know where or what

703
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:02,609
access you're gonna need or who you're

704
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:05,789
gonna need to support you to escort you

705
00:31:02,609 --> 00:31:08,639
through those sites explain to you where

706
00:31:05,789 --> 00:31:10,080
the assets are and I can get you the

707
00:31:08,639 --> 00:31:13,019
data that you need to go and do your

708
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:16,199
investigation there's been lots of posts

709
00:31:13,019 --> 00:31:21,080
right now on Twitter from really smart

710
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:24,479
ice gets orders and joe osovet from

711
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:28,199
dragos bunch others you know bringing

712
00:31:24,479 --> 00:31:29,669
balance you know is a list of Sedna

713
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,129
keynote you know go to where they are

714
00:31:29,669 --> 00:31:33,960
had that discussion you know about their

715
00:31:32,129 --> 00:31:36,959
operations about how they do their job

716
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,440
about what they do for work and then ask

717
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,899
them

718
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:43,559
my favorite question explain to me what

719
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:46,340
your worst day possible here would be if

720
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:48,989
things just went to hell in a handbasket

721
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:52,199
talk me through that scenario explain to

722
00:31:48,989 --> 00:31:55,080
me why they ins would go bad you know

723
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:57,149
let's take you know a lot of

724
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:59,309
rolls off the table what if it doesn't

725
00:31:57,149 --> 00:32:03,059
work you know what's what's the backup

726
00:31:59,309 --> 00:32:04,830
to the backup tab have those discussions

727
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:06,539
you'll learn a lot you'll learn a lot

728
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:08,820
more about how your business operates

729
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:11,250
and then you also make you know some

730
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:13,139
networking connections with a lot of

731
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:14,700
different people in your organization so

732
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:17,039
that when they do see things going bad

733
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:18,870
they know to pick up the phone call you

734
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:20,610
or call your group or call the line

735
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:23,789
hundred or hotline come help me number

736
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:26,370
you have set up to come and respond and

737
00:32:23,789 --> 00:32:29,610
fight that cyber battle just like

738
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:32,879
dialing you know 9-1-1 you know for all

739
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:36,149
of our physical emergencies we don't

740
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:38,039
have that generally in the cyber space

741
00:32:36,149 --> 00:32:38,908
like if you call your police department

742
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,830
right now

743
00:32:38,909 --> 00:32:43,110
and said somebody broke into my house

744
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:46,110
and they stole my file cabinet with all

745
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:48,090
my important data in there and they are

746
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:49,408
holding it ransom and they called me and

747
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:51,928
they said that they're gonna hold it and

748
00:32:49,409 --> 00:32:53,639
so I pay them every Police Department in

749
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:55,169
the world would know how to respond to

750
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:56,760
that every Police Department know how to

751
00:32:55,169 --> 00:32:59,750
investigate that and there's lots of

752
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:02,490
laws established you know the

753
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:04,289
perpetrator has violated you've moved

754
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:08,039
that into the cyber context you don't

755
00:33:04,289 --> 00:33:09,480
have that um you're probably not gonna

756
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:11,158
get anybody at your local police

757
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:13,649
department that's gonna understand one

758
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:16,679
which talking about - how to respond to

759
00:33:13,649 --> 00:33:18,689
it or three how to prosecuted so that's

760
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:21,269
what's you know introducing a lot of

761
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:25,220
confusion in this space we don't have

762
00:33:21,269 --> 00:33:27,029
those national trained to us as children

763
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:32,610
process to call the police

764
00:33:27,029 --> 00:33:35,429
and get support there's a big reluctancy

765
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:38,189
in the cyber space to do that because we

766
00:33:35,429 --> 00:33:40,740
automatically assume you know oh my gosh

767
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:42,240
how did you let this fail how why did

768
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:43,889
you let this happen you should have been

769
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,230
doing something to protect this as we've

770
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:47,760
been streaming up and down for years hey

771
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:51,779
I need more money I need more things I

772
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:56,100
need more tools anymore people anyway I

773
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:59,220
digress but it's something that we have

774
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:02,100
to look at you know nationally and try

775
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:05,309
and come up with a response to but as

776
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:06,299
you are responding in this space the one

777
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:07,740
thing that you want to make sure that

778
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:08,540
you're doing is trying to restore

779
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:11,540
operation

780
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:14,449
as I've said these are critical things

781
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:16,909
that we depend on to live the goal is

782
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:18,469
not to spend you know weeks trying to

783
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:20,960
come up with the investigation get

784
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:22,939
attribution on the bad guys and go hunt

785
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,770
and go do all cool sexy back and stuff

786
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:26,600
the goal is to get the system back up

787
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:29,659
and running you want to try and preserve

788
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:32,810
evidence if you can't okay get the thing

789
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:34,850
back up and running safety is always

790
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:36,770
important these in these areas if you

791
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:39,440
don't have a hardhat and fire retardant

792
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:40,759
clothing and steel toed boots and you're

793
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,820
gonna respond a lot of these spaces

794
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:45,950
they'll get it spend the money it's not

795
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:47,960
a lot of money but it prepares you to

796
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:50,000
protect yourself it prepares you and a

797
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:52,460
lot of cases that that stuff is required

798
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,580
to even walk through the door it also

799
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:57,080
you know takes you off of the worry list

800
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:58,819
for the people at the site that's half

801
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:04,790
gonna escort you around you're a big

802
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:09,100
fire risk so as I talked about also if

803
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:12,740
your IT and ICS cybersecurity groups or

804
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:14,390
support organizations are separated you

805
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:17,959
got to build bridges you got a cross

806
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:20,779
training you gotta communicate you gotta

807
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:22,370
share information you got a kumbaya hug

808
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:24,140
whatever you got to do but you got to

809
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:26,060
work together because no one group can

810
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:28,069
do this by themselves no matter how

811
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:31,370
super awesome you think you are

812
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:34,010
everybody needs help figure out hey need

813
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:36,350
help from and talk about it and then

814
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:39,410
start really focusing on drilling

815
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:44,990
together and learning those shared

816
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:47,629
lessons learned you also have to come up

817
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:49,490
with a priority list so a lot of what I

818
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:51,650
learned from the infantry was battle

819
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:53,830
tracking you know figuring out where my

820
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:56,840
enemy was what their capabilities were

821
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:59,000
what they could do next and then what

822
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:01,010
ground you know they had so we would lay

823
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,630
that out on physical maps we would draw

824
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:05,630
lots of pictures and be like the world

825
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:08,540
war two movie videos things you see them

826
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:10,280
scooting tanks around there's all done

827
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:12,500
with pen and paper and then they started

828
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:14,690
digitalizing a lot of it but that's the

829
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:16,160
type of mentality that you need to take

830
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:19,340
when you go into these compromised

831
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:22,670
environments okay they've gotten my HMI

832
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:24,920
or my PLC or my

833
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:28,100
you know smart relay or whatever they've

834
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:30,890
hacked how did they get here what else

835
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:33,560
could they get to how interconnected are

836
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:36,589
these systems how what connections does

837
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:39,410
this I have to other sites all of that

838
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:40,580
is things that you have to hopefully

839
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:42,859
know ahead of time

840
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:46,000
hopefully you have you know some

841
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:48,110
assitant or some network diagram some

842
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,670
security controllers you've done the

843
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:51,770
research you have an operational

844
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:55,730
security plan figure it out but don't

845
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:58,300
expect it a lot of these groups you know

846
00:36:55,730 --> 00:37:00,530
their primary mission is to generate or

847
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:03,770
deliver that critical service their

848
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:07,310
mission is not to make you know I teach

849
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:08,690
Isis they don't have that IT lingo they

850
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:11,360
don't have a lot of those capabilities

851
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:12,800
so if you're not doing a forum or you're

852
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,150
not helping them to do it you're not

853
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,400
studying that policy in that direction

854
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:20,210
don't expect that stuff to be there when

855
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,640
you need it then we're gonna talk very

856
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:23,930
briefly about the social disruption

857
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:26,930
barometer so when you start losing a

858
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:30,160
critical infrastructure bad things

859
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:33,290
happen quickly or can depending on where

860
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:37,160
society is at that point so this was to

861
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:41,360
use case examples so you had the 1977

862
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:43,910
New York blackout where based on the

863
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:46,210
conditions of the time the lights went

864
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:50,960
out and shortly thereafter you had a

865
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:54,380
bunch of very upset people taking their

866
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:58,040
frustration out on that city then he

867
00:37:54,380 --> 00:38:01,160
jumped to 2003 you know blacked out for

868
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:04,640
three days the major issues things kind

869
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:07,940
of still ran as best they could but it

870
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:10,700
was just the signs of the times so based

871
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:13,340
on the way that 2020 has gone for us I'm

872
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:16,210
pretty sure if we lose anything else

873
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:19,550
it's gonna be a bad day

874
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:22,730
so it's stressed that importance and

875
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:24,860
that understanding that you know the

876
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:27,110
services the critical infrastructure is

877
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:28,820
delivering people depend on that daily

878
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:31,520
when the lights go out people get scared

879
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:33,950
people die because you know America's

880
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,120
cardiovascular health is not great so as

881
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:36,169
soon as somebody has to walk up the

882
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:39,500
stairs you're

883
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:42,170
our tech rate goes up so like I said

884
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:44,780
lights go out and a water goes out and a

885
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:47,290
gas goes out emergency services your

886
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:49,370
financial services Facebook whatever

887
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:51,830
service that you depend on for your life

888
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:55,819
goes out it's a bad day and can get

889
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:57,319
really bad really fast so how do we fix

890
00:38:55,820 --> 00:39:01,610
it

891
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:05,420
my proposal is in line with the current

892
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:08,900
president cybersecurity strategy the

893
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:11,510
National Infrastructure plan of 2013 and

894
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:14,710
the solarium report so all of those

895
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:18,260
documents have really good

896
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:20,240
recommendations and outlines and things

897
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:21,470
that we can do to make improvements the

898
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:24,919
only problem is is that we don't have

899
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:27,049
mandates with milestones and action

900
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:29,600
items and assignments to say this is

901
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:31,490
what we're actually going to do and this

902
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,500
is when and this is how and this is how

903
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:39,430
it's going to get funded we don't have

904
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:41,800
that so I propose that we use existing

905
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:44,210
common-sense cybersecurity framework

906
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:47,090
that all critical infrastructure would

907
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:49,910
follow it should be audited and assessed

908
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:51,980
using the same system it shouldn't be

909
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:54,410
created by each industry vertical

910
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:58,520
because then you just start building in

911
00:39:54,410 --> 00:40:02,089
a lot of regulatory confusion and you

912
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:04,220
start getting things like except for the

913
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:08,510
electric sector that is very

914
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:10,399
prescriptive as far as times and its

915
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:13,190
ways that the controls are implemented

916
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:15,710
it's not just you know having a

917
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:17,120
framework and having control and define

918
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:19,310
how you're gonna do that control its

919
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:20,930
you're gonna patch every 35 days whether

920
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:23,299
you like it or not

921
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:25,759
and if you can't then you're gonna have

922
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:29,870
to come up with this documentation path

923
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:31,970
and it gets confusing very fast the

924
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:34,549
other thing that we need to do as a

925
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:36,200
community is engaged with your cyber

926
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:40,160
security team and other groups within

927
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:41,810
company so one of the bests I think

928
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,330
successes I've had in my career so far

929
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:46,400
was that I brought our Human Resources

930
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:49,049
Group to our Emergency Response table

931
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:52,310
Ingrid x3

932
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:55,280
it started a series of discussions of

933
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:57,779
how do we take care of the people as

934
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,190
we're taking care of the cyber systems

935
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:00,750
as we're taking care that says

936
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:02,790
correspondences we're taking care of the

937
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:04,620
emergency response how do we make sure

938
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:08,670
that people are getting paid how do we

939
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:10,410
make sure that we have furlough job

940
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:12,270
codes lined up so that they're not

941
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:14,819
losing you know their annual and sick

942
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:17,390
leave because we can't bring them to

943
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:20,520
work how are we having those discussions

944
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:22,859
to take care of employees families that

945
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:25,890
might be affected by those emergencies

946
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:27,630
so having those discussions with people

947
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:29,730
that you normally wouldn't have you know

948
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:31,620
that prescriptive you know service

949
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:33,180
create awareness annual training video

950
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:35,460
that everybody has to take becomes very

951
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:38,879
boring and there's no excitement go have

952
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:42,390
real discussions talk about you know the

953
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:44,250
cybersecurity risk for that team talk

954
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:46,440
about what you might need for them and

955
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:48,630
your response talk about what their

956
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:50,460
responsibilities are and then talk about

957
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:52,260
what you know you're gonna bring them

958
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:55,160
and how you're gonna support them when

959
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:57,620
things go bad also

960
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:59,580
engagement with the government's

961
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:01,680
engagement with your vertical partners

962
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:03,509
engagement across sectors which we're

963
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:06,540
seeing more and more of today but I hope

964
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:08,250
that we continue and then measuring the

965
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:10,800
data within government reports again

966
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:13,830
security we have lots of reports that

967
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:17,040
say things are bad they don't see how

968
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:18,779
bad so it's just always do-gooder that's

969
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:21,270
the same thing I told my privates when

970
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:22,650
you know I was a sergeant or whatever

971
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:24,000
they come back and they would attract

972
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:25,260
things up and everything would have been

973
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,950
bad and I've just been like do better

974
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:30,540
you know go do push-ups feel better

975
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:33,839
about yourself and then go do a better

976
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:36,240
job so it has to have some starting

977
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:38,550
point some ground truth where we're at

978
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:41,580
what the insecurity is based on a

979
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:43,320
control not just based on that fear

980
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:45,420
uncertainty and doubt when things can go

981
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:50,820
back but not telling me specifically

982
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:53,430
what so smart regulation is not a bad

983
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:56,900
thing I know a lot of people are scared

984
00:42:53,430 --> 00:43:00,270
of regulation or adverse to regulation

985
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:01,809
but regulation gives you a funding

986
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:04,779
foothold

987
00:43:01,809 --> 00:43:07,239
it can say here is where we're at on

988
00:43:04,779 --> 00:43:09,279
this control this is the risk that's

989
00:43:07,239 --> 00:43:12,309
associated with not having the security

990
00:43:09,279 --> 00:43:15,039
control and it can start funding your

991
00:43:12,309 --> 00:43:16,989
security projects and programs and gives

992
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:19,660
you a lot of backing most of the

993
00:43:16,989 --> 00:43:21,869
electric sectors security efforts are

994
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:24,339
funded under inert set of flack because

995
00:43:21,869 --> 00:43:26,529
we have to meet these regulatory

996
00:43:24,339 --> 00:43:28,689
requirements if we don't there's the

997
00:43:26,529 --> 00:43:31,449
Mexican finds their regulatory oversight

998
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:35,078
we start looking bad as opening or as a

999
00:43:31,449 --> 00:43:38,849
sector so it's the driving force behind

1000
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:38,849
a lot of things that make things better

1001
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:45,459
so I recommend then this cybersecurity

1002
00:43:43,779 --> 00:43:48,430
framework if you're not familiar with

1003
00:43:45,459 --> 00:43:52,598
NIST it's been around for a very long

1004
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:54,160
time it's a federal word that puts

1005
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:55,989
together a lot of different documents

1006
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:57,839
and recommendations that have a very

1007
00:43:55,989 --> 00:44:01,900
extensive library that will give you

1008
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:04,209
security guidance from IOT or forensics

1009
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:06,849
or your whole mess of other things so

1010
00:44:04,209 --> 00:44:08,428
Google them go out there read their

1011
00:44:06,849 --> 00:44:11,859
stuff it's a good place to start with

1012
00:44:08,429 --> 00:44:13,449
for all of your internal policies but I

1013
00:44:11,859 --> 00:44:15,729
recommend this framework for a lot of

1014
00:44:13,449 --> 00:44:18,059
reasons number one reason it doesn't set

1015
00:44:15,729 --> 00:44:22,299
times program constraints or lock you in

1016
00:44:18,059 --> 00:44:24,069
to requirements all the controls as you

1017
00:44:22,299 --> 00:44:27,089
go through them or organizationally to

1018
00:44:24,069 --> 00:44:29,429
define frames or organizationally define

1019
00:44:27,089 --> 00:44:33,400
measurements it doesn't stay

1020
00:44:29,429 --> 00:44:35,559
specifically what you should do so if

1021
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:37,089
you don't have a control implement it

1022
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:39,069
it's okay it's not the end of the world

1023
00:44:37,089 --> 00:44:40,509
you develop your plan of action on

1024
00:44:39,069 --> 00:44:43,839
milestones and you work towards making

1025
00:44:40,509 --> 00:44:45,459
improvements the framework is applied to

1026
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:47,499
your major applications and critical

1027
00:44:45,459 --> 00:44:50,229
functions so it's done at a system level

1028
00:44:47,499 --> 00:44:51,788
you get a lot of good system information

1029
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:53,948
as far as the inventory and network

1030
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:56,619
makeup who owns the thing who runs the

1031
00:44:53,949 --> 00:44:59,910
thing and what controls applies

1032
00:44:56,619 --> 00:45:02,679
specifically to what you would consider

1033
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:05,319
you know a critical part of your

1034
00:45:02,679 --> 00:45:08,219
business whether that's a software tool

1035
00:45:05,319 --> 00:45:10,390
whether that's you know the generation

1036
00:45:08,219 --> 00:45:12,819
control system or the Nesta water

1037
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:14,060
control system whether it's the FAA you

1038
00:45:12,819 --> 00:45:15,950
know control air

1039
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:17,990
traffic control tower whatever the case

1040
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:24,049
may be you get it out of the system

1041
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:25,910
level specific plan and assessment so it

1042
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:28,040
pushes you also to have a continuous

1043
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:29,750
monitoring program across the whole

1044
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:32,150
security spectrum it's not just focused

1045
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:33,860
on one area so we can get very

1046
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:36,050
pigeonhole that one security where we

1047
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:38,050
look at network monitoring where we look

1048
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:42,880
at incident response where we look at

1049
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:46,610
access control whatever that case may be

1050
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:48,710
we get very pigeon-holed on our area of

1051
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:52,430
responsibility this framework really

1052
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:54,440
opened you up to say how can I look at

1053
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:58,279
this entire security spectrum for this

1054
00:45:54,440 --> 00:46:01,280
application it gives you a solid ground

1055
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:03,110
for funding as I said so you're looking

1056
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:06,110
at other control levels so if you don't

1057
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:07,730
have the control implemented when you go

1058
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:09,470
to your security assessment report you

1059
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:11,900
figure that out really quickly you

1060
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:13,629
figure out you know after doing several

1061
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:17,450
of these plans where the gaps are

1062
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:19,640
ballistically for your entire operations

1063
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:22,040
you can say hey we really don't have any

1064
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:25,100
access control measures where we are

1065
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:27,710
blind in this space I need a project I

1066
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:30,410
need a tool specifically to go and do X

1067
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:31,820
here's you know all of these sites that

1068
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:35,600
are there security is going to be

1069
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:37,760
improved for it and you start making a

1070
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:39,170
business value case with measurable data

1071
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,390
with stuff that you can show your

1072
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:44,510
executives that they understand because

1073
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:47,890
they talk your systems they talk you

1074
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:50,800
know your your HR management system your

1075
00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:53,210
control system your plant functions they

1076
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:56,840
understand that they don't understand

1077
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:58,970
server 1-2-3 and end point you know golf

1078
00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:01,400
minor Foxtrot whatever the case may be

1079
00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:03,410
on that they don't speak IT so you have

1080
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:05,270
to take your stuff and put it into a

1081
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:07,790
business language for your executives to

1082
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:09,740
understand and get your back and go

1083
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:14,450
support you when you're competing with

1084
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:15,919
other business projects and efforts but

1085
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:17,390
mainly the first outcome you're going to

1086
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,250
come out of this doing is you're gonna

1087
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:20,990
have a process you're going to realize

1088
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:23,000
that a lot of the operations that the

1089
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:25,339
sites probably don't have clear

1090
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,170
processes for how everything works you

1091
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:30,530
have one person who's been there

1092
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:33,710
twenty years and knows everything and is

1093
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:35,990
looking at retirement and you go and you

1094
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:38,240
can get them in as a hey can you write

1095
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:40,640
this down can you write down how you do

1096
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:43,100
you know the high-level stuff it pushes

1097
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:45,049
towards standardization processes it

1098
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:49,520
also helps you reduce the risk of

1099
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:52,250
employee turnover knowledge transfer so

1100
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:54,020
when you look at how everything is

1101
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:57,290
currently regulated you have the energy

1102
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:59,270
sector over here that has Newark SEP and

1103
00:47:57,290 --> 00:48:02,660
we have lots of requirements you know

1104
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:07,759
the nuclear reactors that have the NRC

1105
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:11,029
and NRC is NIST 853 hai controls on

1106
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:12,500
steroids so they have regulatory

1107
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:14,750
requirements and then you get into the

1108
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:17,900
water sector and just recently you had

1109
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:20,780
the American Water Act American water

1110
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:26,030
infrastructure Act signed into law in

1111
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:28,970
2018 that required them to have an

1112
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:30,740
emergency response plan and a risk

1113
00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:33,230
management plan for anything that was

1114
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:35,839
servicing over 3,000 people so good

1115
00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:37,670
start I mean good good way to even get

1116
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:38,870
some requirements there and then you get

1117
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:42,170
into health care where everybody they

1118
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:44,060
fit the HIPAA controls privacy to data

1119
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:46,520
and that's about as far as it goes it

1120
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:50,210
doesn't provide any regulatory

1121
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:53,290
requirements for system security it

1122
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:55,940
doesn't provide any you know

1123
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:57,740
availability requirements it doesn't

1124
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:59,900
provide you know hospitals don't have to

1125
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:03,500
maintain inventories beyond what the

1126
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:05,810
HIPAA system or what holds HIPAA data so

1127
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:07,370
meaning you started as you go to the

1128
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:10,160
right side of the scale of critical

1129
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:13,210
infrastructure stuff you get out of

1130
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:16,160
clear cybersecurity guidance

1131
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:18,440
requirements and then a majority of all

1132
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:20,690
of your critical sectors are on the

1133
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:22,280
right side of the space that have little

1134
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:25,940
oh nothing

1135
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:28,310
they have voluntary programs and a lot

1136
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:31,580
of cases in the sectors but even those

1137
00:49:28,310 --> 00:49:38,710
are centrally audited or audited by an

1138
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:38,710
outside body so engagement

1139
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:42,919
like I said you need to meet your people

1140
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:44,240
or as Alissa said you need to meet them

1141
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:47,690
where they live you need to take them

1142
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:49,549
don't go under go there as a student I

1143
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:52,010
want to understand better how you do

1144
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:53,960
your stuff so that I can understand

1145
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:55,760
better how to secure it I don't want to

1146
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:57,790
come out you will oh I got you with a

1147
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:00,830
fishing thing I got you

1148
00:49:57,790 --> 00:50:03,440
yep I'm good I got you

1149
00:50:00,830 --> 00:50:05,900
no I want to understand what are you

1150
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:07,670
seeing on a daily basis what you know

1151
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:08,780
who do you interact with what do you

1152
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:10,940
need to do to make your business work

1153
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:13,550
what do you need to do to do your job

1154
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:16,970
and do I have security controls to

1155
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:18,650
protect you going to going as with what

1156
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:20,330
that student mindset or remove your

1157
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:21,830
assumptions because we automatically

1158
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:24,080
assume that people don't care about

1159
00:50:21,830 --> 00:50:26,779
security we automatically assume that

1160
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:28,040
people don't know and we automatically

1161
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:31,610
assume that they're not doing anything

1162
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:33,380
so once you take that mentality off and

1163
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:35,240
you go there and say hey I want to get

1164
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:37,160
to know you better I want to know they

1165
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:38,899
operational better you develop a real

1166
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:44,629
network within your organization that's

1167
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:46,280
pretty conscious is pretty focused so as

1168
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:48,170
I said you know you need to engage with

1169
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:50,480
the government and we have this

1170
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:54,470
wonderful quote from President Reagan

1171
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:56,090
from a press conference in 1986 that

1172
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:57,560
said the nine most terrifying words in

1173
00:50:56,090 --> 00:51:00,350
the English language are I'm from the

1174
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:02,200
government and I'm here to help and in a

1175
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:04,670
lot of cases that can be true however

1176
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:06,529
the government really does want to help

1177
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:08,330
you have a lot of people and a lot of

1178
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:10,790
organization a lot of taxpayer dollars

1179
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:12,319
that are going towards trying to make

1180
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:14,000
things better that are trying to provide

1181
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:15,350
services that are trying to go ahead

1182
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,869
support that are trying to drag

1183
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:20,630
collaboration means to get people

1184
00:51:17,869 --> 00:51:22,790
talking get people sharing and get

1185
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:25,250
people engaged with different programs

1186
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:28,450
and different things that are being

1187
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:32,300
provided so I know it's Airy sometimes

1188
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:36,230
but really trying to reach out get to

1189
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:38,350
know people in these organizations you

1190
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:41,000
know tell them about what you're seeing

1191
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:42,710
you know how those offline conversations

1192
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,990
you know that aren't in formalized

1193
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:47,030
documented reports but you can say hey

1194
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:49,939
I'm seeing this you know I'm a network

1195
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:54,859
from a wire what are y'all see

1196
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:56,780
by DHS do you know what what what else

1197
00:51:54,859 --> 00:51:59,799
should I be concerned about you can do

1198
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:02,510
that and generally a lot of unclassified

1199
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:05,480
space so I mean usually everybody's like

1200
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:06,920
I have to have a secret security

1201
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:11,619
clearance to go talk to the government

1202
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:13,869
know you can talk in open-source

1203
00:52:11,619 --> 00:52:16,069
discussions not everything is classified

1204
00:52:13,869 --> 00:52:17,329
so you're not you don't have to have

1205
00:52:16,069 --> 00:52:20,540
those requirements to have those

1206
00:52:17,329 --> 00:52:23,020
discussions there's a lot of things that

1207
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:27,079
are going on you might not be aware of

1208
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:29,420
FEMA does a lot of community-based

1209
00:52:27,079 --> 00:52:33,460
training and community-based exercises

1210
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:35,950
you can go and take a lot of their

1211
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:40,369
National Incident Management framework

1212
00:52:35,950 --> 00:52:43,040
classes that's how all of your fire

1213
00:52:40,369 --> 00:52:45,349
departments and government emergency

1214
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:47,420
response services are going to show up

1215
00:52:45,349 --> 00:52:48,800
and structure themselves from command

1216
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:51,140
perspectives so they're going to set up

1217
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:53,450
in touch commands they're gonna set up

1218
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:54,799
operational commands a lot of us has

1219
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:56,720
been and demonstrated over the covert

1220
00:52:54,800 --> 00:53:00,290
response so used to all the task force's

1221
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:02,060
being stood up although that's based

1222
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:05,270
under FEMA government guidance that we

1223
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:06,890
learned after 9/11 so now the government

1224
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:09,259
will pretty much respond the same way

1225
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:10,790
your Fire Department police department

1226
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:12,740
emergency services department if they

1227
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:14,150
show up at your site that's how they're

1228
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:15,578
gonna structure themselves and that's

1229
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:18,050
kind of what they're gonna be expecting

1230
00:53:15,579 --> 00:53:20,390
to interface so having some

1231
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:22,579
understanding of how that works will

1232
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:24,379
help you not only with your internal

1233
00:53:22,579 --> 00:53:27,859
response but also how to interact with

1234
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:29,660
those services there's a lot of groups

1235
00:53:27,859 --> 00:53:31,640
and coordinating sectors and

1236
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:32,480
coordinating councils and other things

1237
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:35,660
that are out there

1238
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:36,950
Google your sector figure out where

1239
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:39,319
they're at talk to the people in your

1240
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:40,848
agency or your company to probably have

1241
00:53:39,319 --> 00:53:44,869
somebody that it was something about or

1242
00:53:40,849 --> 00:53:46,910
attended something they are doing a lot

1243
00:53:44,869 --> 00:53:49,569
of good collaborative efforts that are

1244
00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:52,160
very sector specific you have

1245
00:53:49,569 --> 00:53:54,069
information sharing and analysis centers

1246
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:55,970
for almost all of these verticals

1247
00:53:54,069 --> 00:53:58,759
they're doing a lot of good information

1248
00:53:55,970 --> 00:54:02,359
and collection and a lot of good

1249
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:03,710
collaboration exercises so I'll plug the

1250
00:54:02,359 --> 00:54:06,560
e I stack again

1251
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:07,670
if you're in the electric sector we do

1252
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:09,830
grid X every year

1253
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:11,900
it's a great exercise we learn a lot

1254
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:14,299
every time it's a lot of fun if you're

1255
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:16,730
not in the electric sector you can still

1256
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:18,310
reach out and talk to them and see about

1257
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:22,550
observing or seeing about

1258
00:54:18,310 --> 00:54:25,640
cross-collaboration participation in the

1259
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:29,000
EIS council this is a worldwide exercise

1260
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:31,730
that's basically a black sky end-of-days

1261
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:34,880
type of drill is conducted every year

1262
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:37,700
it's very good it's probably one of the

1263
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:39,170
best formatted and structured exercises

1264
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:42,819
i've ever seen in my life and have lots

1265
00:54:39,170 --> 00:54:45,950
of videos and games and web portal

1266
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:47,420
clickable stuff very good exercise I've

1267
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:51,680
learned a lot every time I've played and

1268
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:57,160
go check them out the other thing is

1269
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:59,839
that communicating so as I said you know

1270
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:02,180
you can't expect these organizations to

1271
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:04,010
reach out to you they there's a lot more

1272
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:06,830
companies than there are agencies or

1273
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:08,480
agents so the best thing the best

1274
00:55:06,830 --> 00:55:10,670
approach is generally to reach out to

1275
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:12,620
them when you do that you're bringing

1276
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:13,880
them to your table so if you come to my

1277
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:15,620
house for dinner I'm gonna say what

1278
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:20,090
we're gonna have to eat I'm also gonna

1279
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:22,430
steer that conversation so I don't think

1280
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:25,100
companies should be waiting for the

1281
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:29,000
government to you know push regulatory

1282
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:32,480
law requirements I think that the

1283
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:35,810
voluntary sector leadership should

1284
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:39,470
really be pushing for Standardization if

1285
00:55:35,810 --> 00:55:42,529
it's madness something missed like to

1286
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:44,419
start defining that data out so that we

1287
00:55:42,530 --> 00:55:47,360
can get it to those organizations and we

1288
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:48,950
can show really where these critical

1289
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:51,320
infrastructure verticals are vulnerable

1290
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:53,569
and really what programs and support

1291
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:56,210
services are needed to make sure that

1292
00:55:53,570 --> 00:55:58,310
America is protected and if you're

1293
00:55:56,210 --> 00:56:02,110
outside of America watching this reach

1294
00:55:58,310 --> 00:56:04,310
out to your government organizations

1295
00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:05,810
pretty much every government in the

1296
00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:07,549
world that I'm aware of is doing

1297
00:56:05,810 --> 00:56:09,110
something in this face Canada I know

1298
00:56:07,550 --> 00:56:12,230
does a lot of stuff under the world

1299
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:16,130
at least the European games doing a lot

1300
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:17,630
of stuff but you get you're gonna have

1301
00:56:16,130 --> 00:56:21,230
to steer the conversation yourself

1302
00:56:17,630 --> 00:56:24,890
you're gonna have to start you know

1303
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:26,180
sharing data sharing you know what

1304
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:28,129
you're seeing you don't have to get

1305
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:30,649
people you don't have to get the

1306
00:56:28,130 --> 00:56:34,400
government into your network for them to

1307
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:36,050
understand like I made the case I if I

1308
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:39,050
had a physical somebody break into my

1309
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:40,970
house I don't need a police officer

1310
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:43,670
sitting at my front door I need somebody

1311
00:56:40,970 --> 00:56:46,700
I can call and say this happened please

1312
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:48,140
come help me so a lot of what you've

1313
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:49,939
seen in the some of those reports after

1314
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:51,410
you've read them there's some like you

1315
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:54,950
know companies are reluctant to allow

1316
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:57,080
government to see their data or you know

1317
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:58,640
put things on their perimeter that's

1318
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:01,880
right because I don't need a cop you

1319
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:03,980
know watching my front door I need you

1320
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:05,870
know that support when bad things happen

1321
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:08,180
they're gonna come hope me and not try

1322
00:57:05,870 --> 00:57:10,819
and take over and understand that my

1323
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:13,460
business operation is the primary

1324
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:15,290
response and we're gonna make sure you

1325
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:18,260
get all the data that you can to go you

1326
00:57:15,290 --> 00:57:21,290
know find the bad people and put them in

1327
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:22,600
jail but I need you to come help me and

1328
00:57:21,290 --> 00:57:25,490
this is how I need your help

1329
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:27,799
so communicate communicate communicate

1330
00:57:25,490 --> 00:57:29,959
before bad things happen because our

1331
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:35,330
conversation changes after the bad

1332
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:37,790
things happen final segment is

1333
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:40,880
measurement so we have all of these

1334
00:57:37,790 --> 00:57:43,130
reports they all say we need to be

1335
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:46,850
better they all give lots of ideas on

1336
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:52,130
how to do better but really what we need

1337
00:57:46,850 --> 00:57:54,380
is all of the political input that the

1338
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:56,900
private sector has for these spaces

1339
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:59,480
because all of these verticals make the

1340
00:57:56,900 --> 00:58:02,530
country run there's lots of lobbying and

1341
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:06,560
other groups that are representing these

1342
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:08,720
verticals we need them to help you know

1343
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:12,200
reach out to their lawmakers and reach

1344
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:14,990
out to people and say this is what I

1345
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:16,910
need from the government this is how you

1346
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:20,830
know in your solarium Commissioner for

1347
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:22,339
international cyberspace strategy in

1348
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:24,770
mid-2013

1349
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:27,350
how we would like to collaborate or how

1350
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:28,670
we would like to implement this this is

1351
00:58:27,350 --> 00:58:32,330
where we think we would get the most

1352
00:58:28,670 --> 00:58:34,010
effectiveness we need to get clear

1353
00:58:32,330 --> 00:58:36,170
measurement across all of critical

1354
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:38,030
infrastructure you do that

1355
00:58:36,170 --> 00:58:39,650
as the Donald Sutherland quote one

1356
00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:43,640
measurement is worth a thousand expert

1357
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:46,580
opinions so if I can bring data that is

1358
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:48,470
back backed up and mean something then I

1359
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:52,730
get my point across hopefully a lot

1360
00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:54,350
faster so what can you do you from this

1361
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:56,810
conference like every security

1362
00:58:54,350 --> 00:58:58,790
conference we go to will go there will

1363
00:58:56,810 --> 00:59:00,799
hear lots of great information will take

1364
00:58:58,790 --> 00:59:03,200
about 10% back will take it internally

1365
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:05,270
and we probably won't be much with it I

1366
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:07,520
encourage you to take what you are

1367
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:09,020
learning here from Melissa's keynote

1368
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:12,140
from the other talks that are coming up

1369
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:15,620
you have a great lineup after me very

1370
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:18,049
highly technical talks some more

1371
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:20,020
strategic talks a lot of good concepts a

1372
00:59:18,050 --> 00:59:22,970
lot of good things that are going on

1373
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:24,500
security sector right now take that and

1374
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:27,200
learn from it send out the links to your

1375
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:31,280
team some of the people outside of your

1376
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:33,370
cyber security team as I said if you

1377
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:37,520
don't have your operation security plan

1378
00:59:33,370 --> 00:59:39,680
focused on your critical things that

1379
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:44,630
make a company run probably need to have

1380
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:46,399
that it's gonna come up at some point

1381
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:48,170
you're gonna need that plan and having

1382
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:50,480
it you know after the fact it isn't

1383
00:59:48,170 --> 00:59:53,300
gonna help you and then your disaster

1384
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:55,280
recovery plans drilling exercises and

1385
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:57,020
then personally you know I think from

1386
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:59,930
Kovac we've learned you know how to be

1387
00:59:57,020 --> 01:00:02,170
prepared individually if you need more

1388
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:04,850
help ready.gov will help you out a lot

1389
01:00:02,170 --> 01:00:07,340
one question I got was how does America

1390
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:09,250
fight back this is a current policy on

1391
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:11,510
that not really gonna go into it but

1392
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:15,070
that capability you know is being

1393
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:18,470
developed but that kind of goes into the

1394
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:22,220
company shouldn't hack back as you could

1395
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:24,529
set off a war reach out to your

1396
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:26,870
lawmakers reach out to the FBI

1397
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:29,660
Department of Justice your local police

1398
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:30,410
department whatever the case may be do

1399
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:33,770
it the right way

1400
01:00:30,410 --> 01:00:36,740
inform the police

1401
01:00:33,770 --> 01:00:40,250
and let them take it from there

1402
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:42,430
so we're four questions I think we're

1403
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:44,810
gonna move over to the discord track -

1404
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:46,779
if you have anything for me you can post

1405
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:49,480
them up there and I'll respond to them

1406
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:52,100
