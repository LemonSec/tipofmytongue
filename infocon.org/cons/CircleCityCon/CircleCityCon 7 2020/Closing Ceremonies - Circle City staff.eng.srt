00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:14,530

2
00:00:11,769 --> 00:00:18,190

3
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:21,689

4
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:24,010
to thank everybody for joining our

5
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,690
wonderful joint transmission over the

6
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:28,210
weekends we hope everyone's had a great

7
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:29,860
time this was a new journey for us there

8
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,870
was a new journey for I think everyone I

9
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:34,420
mean that's 2020 this year as a new

10
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:36,940
journey for everyone for good things and

11
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:38,559
for bad things but seems mostly bad

12
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:41,170
these days but we hope that this

13
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:43,149
conference has brought a bit of good

14
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:45,670
into your life we hope that it's helped

15
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:46,929
and we hope you had an exciting time we

16
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,940
hope you've learned things we've hope

17
00:00:46,929 --> 00:00:52,510
you shared some wonderful memories and

18
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:56,409
we hope that those times that you've

19
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:59,678
experienced with talking late-night with

20
00:00:56,409 --> 00:01:01,289
people in the discord channels I know I

21
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:04,690
was for instance in a few channels

22
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:06,130
discussing in mixology about people's

23
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:08,200
careers and talking about so many great

24
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:11,080
things I got this witness people being

25
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,150
very excellent towards each other and

26
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,990
helping each other out and I think

27
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:18,250
that's amazing to see in these times

28
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:21,070
hackers helping each other out and being

29
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:24,040
that community together and you know

30
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:26,229
even though all this is going on we were

31
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:30,190
able to come together and still bring

32
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:33,550
our community together and and help each

33
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:35,679
other so we always like to do a

34
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:37,270
by-the-numbers cuz these grow every year

35
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:42,640
and there's so many awesome things going

36
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:43,840
on this year we had 521 attendees and by

37
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,950
that I mean people who were not

38
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,970
volunteers not speakers not trainers etc

39
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,670
which is one of the highest numbers

40
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:54,700
we've ever had of people who are

41
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:59,710
attendee tickets and I also took a look

42
00:01:54,700 --> 00:02:01,810
we had 678 total participants it took a

43
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:04,679
little less staff to run to run a

44
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:07,090
virtual con still quite a few people and

45
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,310
to run that so that number is a little

46
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,680
bit lower than our last year's of last

47
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:13,420
year's numbers but still amazing that

48
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,950
during these times of course we can

49
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:17,079
bring so many people together

50
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:18,670
and again hopefully everyone had great

51
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,550
time I know I had a great time in here

52
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:24,309
in the bunker with blackjack and jabs

53
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:28,180
and we hope in your bunkers your your

54
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:30,220
tents your your domiciles your shelters

55
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:33,610
that you were able to also have a great

56
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:36,099
time we had 10 trainings and I know all

57
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:40,300
together that represents hundreds of

58
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:42,518
students in those trainings as well and

59
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,290
so we had you know hundreds of students

60
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:47,489
being trained learning new skills

61
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:51,370
sharing knowledge and so I hope everyone

62
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:55,780
enjoyed those we also had 24 resume

63
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:57,730
reviews in the job hunters channel that

64
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,709
was really that was really great and

65
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:03,250
we're so happy that he so many of you

66
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:07,269
took appreciation for Angus I think it

67
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:08,829
was angus red and also Rando were

68
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:10,900
greatly appreciated for lending their

69
00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:13,810
services and their skills to that in

70
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:16,840
helping that go well and it'd be very

71
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:19,720
nice to hear back from back from

72
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:23,260
attendees if they found their job during

73
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:25,239
the apocalypse at Circle City Con and if

74
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:27,310
people were able to hire at Circle City

75
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:29,139
Con we've seen it in the past of course

76
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:32,290
Circle City cons that are attended

77
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:34,000
physically but uh if you see that be

78
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,620

79
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,840

81
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,459

84
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:49,030
things that we're doing in this

85
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:50,230
community we had 52 talks I tried to

86
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,760
make sure I count them all maybe I

87
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,160
didn't camel correctly but we have about

88
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,880
52 talks those are going to be uploaded

89
00:03:54,160 --> 00:04:00,700
to YouTube to YouTube soon did we

90
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:03,099
mention we have a YouTube channel that

91
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,750
is going to be coming very soon we're

92
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:06,518
working on crafting that and building

93
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,200
that up so in the next couple days don't

94
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:10,660
be surprised if you start seeing tweets

95
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,668
and other communications indicating that

96
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:15,450
we've uploaded started uploading those

97
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:18,070
videos we know that there were several

98
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:21,668
talks that everyone seemed to really

99
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:23,289
enjoy and so we want to make sure

100
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:25,120
everyone has the capability of

101
00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:26,259
rewatching those watching ones that they

102
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,240
couldn't

103
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:29,919
they couldn't get to and also of course

104
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,650
opening it up to the people we're not

105
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:35,948
able to be here today as stated at the

106
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:39,818
opening ceremonies we had over we've had

107
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:42,129
now over 3600 people that have attended

108
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:47,139
Circle City con in the last seven years

109
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:50,139
and when we first started Circle City

110
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:52,210
Con in the first year I think we had a

111
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:54,969
little over a hundred people at the

112
00:04:52,210 --> 00:05:00,008
conference and to just see those that

113
00:04:54,969 --> 00:05:02,889
number contrast is is just amazing being

114
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:04,750
able to see the happiness of people to

115
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:07,870
be able to be laid-back to hang out with

116
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:09,279
folks and to truly just come together as

117
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:11,620
a community is amazing but to know that

118
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:17,439
we've served and brought together over

119
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:21,189
300 3600 people hacker's over over our

120
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:23,620
lifetime so far it's an achievement and

121
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:26,050
we thank everyone for placing that trust

122
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:28,210
within us to be able to forge that

123
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:30,550
community and bring bring a space for

124
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:33,068
everybody to come together and we look

125
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:35,860
forward to seeing that number grow quite

126
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:38,589
a bit over the next several years there

127
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:40,680
were also I this was hard this was

128
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:42,969
actually a hard number to capture

129
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,849
because every time I measured it again

130
00:05:42,969 --> 00:05:47,860
it kept growing by at least a thousand

131
00:05:45,849 --> 00:05:49,930
so do not be surprised if you look back

132
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,879
in discord and it's actually bigger but

133
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:54,449
last time I checked discord about an

134
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:57,669
hour ago or maybe half hour ago we had

135
00:05:54,449 --> 00:06:00,180
25,000 messages that you all have set in

136
00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:03,099
our discord chats to each other and

137
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:04,990
probably the memes are to mostly be

138
00:06:03,099 --> 00:06:08,110
responsible for that and we appreciate

139
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:10,139
your means they are quite delicious and

140
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:12,250
so we want to thank everybody for being

141
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:12,759
participatory and we're so glad you had

142
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:17,589
fun

143
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:19,409
in the discord talks and trainings this

144
00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:21,879
was this was something that was uh

145
00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:23,379
that's always kind of the staple of a

146
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:24,849
conference of course as talks and then

147
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:28,960
of course with Circle City Connor our

148
00:06:24,849 --> 00:06:30,639
trainings and putting those on always

149
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,659
seems like it should be a standard thing

150
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:37,270
every year doing it virtually was very

151
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:38,729
non-standard and we had to develop a new

152
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:41,710
standard for doing

153
00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:47,050
and delivering those trainings and so I

154
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:49,000
want to thank I reject for putting

155
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:51,509
together a system in which we could

156
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,090
capture those trainings and talks and

157
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:59,289
delivering those and also the speaker

158
00:06:55,090 --> 00:07:01,570
ops volunteers to carry out and and

159
00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:02,830
actually and actually record those and

160
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:05,440
capture those and stream those up

161
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:08,590
through mixer that was that was amazing

162
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,120
work that that had to be done and so so

163
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:11,440
many people did hard work on that so I

164
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,090
want to thank everyone for that and

165
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,039
thanks to all the trainers and speakers

166
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:17,409

everything that you saw in discord was

227
00:09:46,929 --> 00:09:52,600
was was crafted with a lot of love with

228
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:54,670
a lot of consideration and there were

229
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,949
definitely some lessons learned I'm sure

230
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:58,779
from some of the things that happened

231
00:09:56,949 --> 00:10:00,579
that we're done and I know we had to pop

232
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:03,419
up some channels to handle some extra

233
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:06,729
things we didn't foresee coming and we

234
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:08,709
we appreciate everyone working with us

235
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:12,059
on that for some of the rough edges I'm

236
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:14,679
sure that needed to be smoothed out but

237
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:17,529
you know it was it was all because of

238
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:19,749
the fine folks work there that we had

239
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:21,699
such a comprehensive environment in

240
00:10:19,749 --> 00:10:24,100
discord to work with to deliver

241
00:10:21,699 --> 00:10:25,988
announcements to provide community

242
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,119
little communities and little areas in

243
00:10:25,989 --> 00:10:30,579
Lobby con and other places for people to

244
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:33,549
enjoy chatting with each other on on

245
00:10:30,579 --> 00:10:36,549
topics and we hope we hope that

246
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:39,100
facilitated a lot of a lot of sharing of

247
00:10:36,549 --> 00:10:41,709
knowledge sharing of experiences

248
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,499
supporting one another and just trying

249
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:47,529
to have lift one another in that way

250
00:10:43,499 --> 00:10:50,470
also special thanks as always I think

251
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:52,360
ever since year for one dark one has

252
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:56,230
designed the logo for circle city con

253
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:59,139
and I have to say that always amazing

254
00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:03,220
amazing work by one dark one who runs a

255
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:05,139
hot iron creative so I give a

256
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,400
recommendation all the time and we

257
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:10,330
definitely have appreciate

258
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:12,189
this artwork especially this year given

259
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:15,130
the circumstances of what ended up

260
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:18,820
happening we had this logo back and fall

261
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:22,090
and you know it it still ended up

262
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:24,100
becoming a decent logo to use during

263
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:28,960
during the crises that have been going

264
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:33,370
on so we we didn't try to predict the

265
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:36,910
apocalypse but but seems like we did and

266
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:38,440
we didn't try to you know we didn't try

267
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:41,079
to predict space for us either but we

268
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:44,260
did that so I've heard some calls that

269
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:46,750
if if we if we have to choose the theme

270
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:49,569
for next year we should probably make it

271
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:51,790
like utopia rainbows unicorns I think I

272
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:55,030
even saw a happy little trees suggestion

273
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:56,290
like from Bob Ross so we don't know

274
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:59,110
what's gonna go on with that but

275
00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:00,610
definitely we need to stop predicting

276
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:02,200
the future or at least if we are going

277
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:06,010
to start predicting really nice futures

278
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:07,960
so we'll see what we can do still trying

279
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:12,460
to figure out who Karl is did anybody

280
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:15,520
figure that out but I think I think I

281
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:18,130
just might have heard a revelation from

282
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:20,920
Karl that might come later that might

283
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:24,160
come later so stay tuned for the cast we

284
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:27,459
might hear from from a profit of Karl

285
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,230
and at this point of course we like to

286
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:32,140
turn it over to the contests and night

287
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:34,510
events and see who gets to win all the

288
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:37,030
lovely prizes for all the shenanigans

289
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:38,710
and things we did so at this time I'm

290
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:46,600
gonna go ahead and turn it on over to

291
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:48,940
Lynn tile all right everyone how are we

292
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,340
doing I would normally get a raucous

293
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:54,400
amount of applause but we're just gonna

294
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:56,500
have to you know sacrifice for what I'm

295
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,900
sure everybody is yelling at their

296
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,700
screens you know if we are going to have

297
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:03,189
an apocalypse the thing you're going to

298
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,930
need is the logs and metrics if it

299
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:07,800
they'll have the pcaps it didn't happen

300
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:10,870

00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:31,340
about the CTF by the statists

355
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:32,750

356
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:36,710

00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:46,790
basically this year one of the things I

361
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:49,579
did for those of you who did not play

362
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:51,740
the CTF we actually created an

363
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:55,330
alternative discord where all of the

364
00:15:51,740 --> 00:16:00,590
seats you have challenges were held and

365
00:15:55,330 --> 00:16:03,650
using a discord bot which registered a

366
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:06,560
lot more things than normally you have

367
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:08,030
access to when you're playing a CTF so

368
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,119

features you know obviously we had to

448
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,080
pivot this to a different

449
00:19:55,130 --> 00:20:00,170
format because of the virtual nature of

00:21:55,450 --> 00:22:01,610
identify with different words as part of

495
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:02,990
that you can see that never by far by

496
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:05,959
far and away just being the first

497
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:08,700
channel had the majority of lobby con

498
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:10,500
and hallway con but you know

499
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,930
we had some people that like to get deep

500
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,640
into you that's the other spike with

501
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:17,190
over a hundred messages in that channel

502
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:20,400

535
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:23,379

536
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:26,380

00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:36,879
need me to keep going I can we can't

540
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:38,290
never gonna give you up yeah actually if

541
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,179
you want to know that the one in the

542
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:42,700
middle is the Santa tracker straws

543
00:25:40,179 --> 00:25:44,230
that's that's where we always put that

544
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:47,049
one on the middle one because that's the

545
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:49,809
important gonna get a takedown Craven if

546
00:25:47,049 --> 00:25:52,570
I get a takedown based upon my singing

547
00:25:49,809 --> 00:25:55,120
I'm gonna consider that a win if if it

548
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:58,320
is even so close to the actual recording

549
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,320
that it gets DNC aid

550
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:17,080
yes see anytime anytime the peon starts

551
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:18,370
posting honk I really think it's

552
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,949
important to start blaming them for

553
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:23,770
whatever is going on yeah so like that's

554
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:25,480
that's pretty much attribution or at

555
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:33,780
least good enough for certain companies

556
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:33,780
around the world but idk good enough

557
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:39,840
fair honestly

558
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:49,429
we're the hacker true that that's like

559
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:50,330
not the most questionable thing then

560
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:53,600
tell where is it public

561
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:56,679
not even close yeah I think that there's

562
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,679
a lot more questions to ask

563
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:07,570
no no no nobody answer okay nobody

564
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:10,260

sure

592
00:28:51,549 --> 00:28:55,639
and now to talk a little bit about the

593
00:28:53,929 --> 00:28:58,250
discord environment and virtual contents

594
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:03,470
I am going to bring a kit over here

595
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:05,330
blackjack I mean if I'm still on hey I

596
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:07,610
see me there you go hi everybody on

597
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:09,799
blackjack so a couple of the things we

598
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:12,049
recognize about discord is going

599
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:15,679
remarkably well and we're really excited

600
00:29:12,049 --> 00:29:17,990
about how everybody is enjoying it we

601
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,909
want to keep the conversation going

602
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:21,440
we know that everybody's connected with

603
00:29:19,909 --> 00:29:23,539
each other right now and we recognize

604
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,280
one of the big let downs after a con is

605
00:29:23,539 --> 00:29:26,809
you go home all the great people you've

606
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,799
met you don't get to talk to them

607
00:29:26,809 --> 00:29:29,539
anymore

608
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:30,980
simply by distance and yeah you could

609
00:29:29,539 --> 00:29:32,570
send emails and tweet and so on but it's

610
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:34,370
not the same so here's what we're gonna

611
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:36,830
do at least for right now we're gonna

612
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:37,939
keep the conversation going in the

613
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:41,240
discord that you're enjoying right now

614
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:45,200
for one week after that it'll be read

615
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:46,850
only after that we're not sure we've

616
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,190
already had a lot of great internal

617
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:51,799
conversations about discord and about

618
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:55,220
moving forward in some virtual way we

619
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:57,470
know this much that the next circle city

620
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:59,840
con that meets a meet space because

621
00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:01,520
honestly I miss seeing all of your faces

622
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,168
there are other faces that you miss

623
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,149
seeing and we want to see each other

624
00:30:03,169 --> 00:30:07,570
again but we recognize that this is

625
00:30:05,149 --> 00:30:10,459
something that's a game changer for us

626
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:12,399
so there's going to be a virtual conned

627
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:15,140
goes with the physical Khan in some way

628
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:18,050
what is that gonna be like we don't know

629
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:19,700
yet but stick to this channel keep

630
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:21,800

631
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:23,780
content on reddit and of course we'll

637
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:41,660

638
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:45,460

639
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:49,640

640
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:52,130
501c3 so in the next coming months we

641
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:54,770
hope to be able to announce that there

642
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:57,980
will be a 501 C 3 that will now put on

643
00:30:54,770 --> 00:31:00,379
Circle City con and that will give us a

644
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:04,730
lot of different opportunities to be

645
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:06,740
able to support the community in having

646
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:09,650
having donors that make it available to

647
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:12,130
allow more complimentary and free

648
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:15,380
tickets being able to give to attendees

649
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:17,930
to allow for things like education and

650
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:19,370
mentorship programs and just so many

651
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:20,690
other things that we want to be able to

652
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:23,120
do with this conference to help the

653
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:25,310
community and bring people together so

654
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,469
we hope everyone will be in support of

655
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:28,600
that and join us in that journey and

656
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:35,960
