1
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:19,020
hey everybody welcome to between a sock

2
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,570
and a hard place

3
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,340
hopefully a fun talk to close out the

4
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,869
day I'll be honest I've never given this

5
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,600
one before so we're really gonna see how

6
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:30,419
it goes a little bit about me my name is

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,759
Sean or under study 77 I am the paranoid

8
00:00:30,419 --> 00:00:34,829
and I am a paranoid and the head of the

9
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,480
security operation center Verizon B I

10
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:41,070
have worked in or run several socks from

11
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,260
government to managed service to private

12
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:46,140
industry I was a breach consultant in my

13
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,480
past life I am a 1/2 of the detections

14
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,489
podcast which is a weekly blue team

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,858
related podcast and to be honest

16
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:54,269
especially through covin really really

17
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:56,910
suck at Twitter but I do try to be

18
00:00:54,269 --> 00:00:59,010
relatively engaged there so that's a

19
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,379
little bit about me we'll dive into kind

20
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,699
of the topic at hand so first and I

21
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:04,830
learned this kind of the hard way on

22
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:07,590
Twitter we really need to define what a

23
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,150
sock is before we get into this and it's

24
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,640
not system-on-a-chip is a lot of people

25
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,620
thought so a sock is a security

26
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,579
operation center or in most cases or in

27
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:20,070
our case a place where analysts security

28
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:22,020
analysts or security engineers look for

29
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:25,679
bad an environment and look for external

30
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:27,350
attackers a couple disclaimers first one

31
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,119
this is based on my experience

32
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:32,490
experiences as I've spoken to the

33
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,740
industry is large definitions and a

34
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,079
reality change from place to place as I

35
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,850
talk about some of this stuff

36
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,649
maybe this hits home maybe it doesn't

37
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,729
maybe you go hey I've never experienced

38
00:01:40,649 --> 00:01:44,310
anything like this in my life

39
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:45,570
however we did query kind of some

40
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,860
external people a little bit and this is

41
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:51,419
what we got back so I hand-picked a

42
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,790
little bit of these admittedly because

43
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,530
they're funny so you know glorified

44
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,590
security oriented Tier one helpdesk

45
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:01,469
support they watch the pews and report

46
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:04,229
packet know knows things that are just

47
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:05,429
kind of humorous a couple people said

48
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:08,190
it's the place that keeps them from

49
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,110
doing their job or they push different

50
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:13,410
training and we'll get into some of

51
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,760
those as we go so coming from this and

52
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,530
I'll leave it up so that people can kind

53
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,179
of take it and read a couple of them if

54
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,730
they want to hopefully they show up okay

55
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,470
on the screen but really we're gonna get

56
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:25,440
into my opinion and something that I

57
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:30,150
think has been largely lost

58
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:33,390
the industry and that is that a sock is

59
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:35,640
one of if not the most important part of

60
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:38,309
the security program now we could argue

61
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,140
this all day I could make my own use

62
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:42,060
cases for things like vulnerability

63
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:44,130
management I could make my own cases for

64
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:47,790
fixing and patching and and all those

65
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:49,109
things but even if you're on top of

66
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:52,440
vulnerability management you patch

67
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:54,900
everything you do these things attackers

68
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,090
are still going to attack and somebody

69
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,470
needs to be there so to catch those

70
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,810
attackers if you don't want to have an

71
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:02,340
issue specifically because a good

72
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:07,710
majority of attacks that happen today

73
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:10,170
aren't even based on vulnerabilities

74
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:11,880
it's you know 91 percent of most attacks

75
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:14,489
depending on where you read is because

76
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,560
of phishing so social engineering and

77
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:18,300
phishing so yes security awareness and

78
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,860
training also becomes very important but

79
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,410
somebody is going to get through and

80
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,810
somebody needs to be there to protect

81
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:27,299
the company from that perspective so

82
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:29,730
really we ask ourselves what are we here

83
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:32,310
for well we're here to find badness

84
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:34,290
we're here to protect users that's

85
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:37,709
what's important that's what we need

86
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:39,450
that's what we want to do and you're

87
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:41,850
gonna see this come back as we go

88
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:43,410
because this part is particularly

89
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,940
important and if not one of the most

90
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:46,350
important statements that I will make

91
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:49,109
throughout the course of this

92
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:51,840
presentation but before we dive into

93
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:54,000
that we really have to talk about what's

94
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,220
the reality what is the world actually

95
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,380
look like at least you know from what

96
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:01,950
I've seen

97
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:04,140
well not quite as grand or grandiose is

98
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:07,290
that big statement of fine badness

99
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:08,880
protect users right spill often socks

100
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,769
are filled with the least experienced

101
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,880
individuals they're given little to no

102
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:14,220
trust your ability

103
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:17,130
they've relatively low visibility and

104
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:18,450
often in over reliance on tools I deal

105
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:21,060
with a mountain of alerts that they

106
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:23,580
don't have any real control over they're

107
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:26,010
not empowered to find that root cause so

108
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,159
how much really any cause they can't fix

109
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:30,539
security problems they can escalate

110
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,740
death by a thousand cuts is something

111
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,450
that we'll dig into more later and

112
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,729
that's a really big one too and and

113
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:36,460
lastly this concept that a sock is a

114
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:38,680
step

115
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:40,448
Stone something that somebody needs to

116
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,889
get out of something that somebody kind

117
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:46,120
of comes in to puts in their time and

118
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:48,190
then moves on and as we go we're gonna

119
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,460
explain all of these in more depth but

120
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:54,069
first let's talk about why why is it

121
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:56,349
like this well we can break that down

122
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:57,940
into a couple different reasons often

123
00:04:56,349 --> 00:04:59,560
there's a lack of missionary purpose

124
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:01,180
that first slide that we talked about

125
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,650
there's a lack of trust in the personnel

126
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:05,550
you'll see you see that twice between

127
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:08,830
the two but it this is a why as well

128
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:11,620
tiered structures swimlanes you can do

129
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:14,680
this but you can't do this segmentation

130
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:15,880
infighting ego it tends to be a big part

131
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,410
of our industry like it or not

132
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,539
especially when you start talking about

133
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:22,860
ranks and tiers and things like that I

134
00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:25,449
need to justify itself to the business

135
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,340
and my personal favorite the one that

136
00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:29,919
I'm not even going to explain because

137
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:31,210
that's how it's done everywhere just not

138
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,789
something I want to get into right now

139
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:35,830
but we are gonna dig into these more and

140
00:05:33,789 --> 00:05:37,509
more as we go

141
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,859
if you'll notice basically the whole

142
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:40,720
theme of this outside of the first page

143
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:42,520
is gonna be IT Crowd I hope everybody is

144
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,080
interested in that it's one of my

145
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,780
favorite shows of all time and I think

146
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:50,229
they have a lot of very relevant gifts

147
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:51,580
here so before we dive into some of

148
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:57,250
these issues I'm going to take a quick

149
00:05:51,580 --> 00:06:00,400
drink so let's hit these down a list one

150
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:02,800
to one piece-by-piece lack of a clear

151
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,020
mission or purpose well what really

152
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,330
brings this abettor what comes if you

153
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:08,680
don't have that well that concept of

154
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:11,349
dealing with a mountain of alerts that

155
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,449
you have no control absolutely a big

156
00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:16,180
part of it not being empowered to find

157
00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:17,469
root cause or any cause well if we

158
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,830
really think about it so if we if we

159
00:06:17,469 --> 00:06:22,870
don't know why we're there then how are

160
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:24,550
we gonna be empire empowered to find a

161
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:26,320
root cause or figure out what happened

162
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:29,680
or fix security problems rather than

163
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:32,229
escalate them defining who and what we

164
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,880
are up front becomes really important

165
00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:35,050
otherwise we'll run into this or one of

166
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,509
my favorites death by a thousand cuts

167
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:39,090
and this is something that I've seen in

168
00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:41,740
almost every stock that I've been in and

169
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:45,520
most of the Sox that I've run had this

170
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:47,820
problem when I went in to where oh well

171
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,740
we have this thing we're just gonna

172
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,810
toss that over to the sock it can be

173
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:54,660
their problem we'll let them worry about

174
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:56,340
it so you know socks will often end up

175
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,620
doing like things like Network changes

176
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:00,539
or things like account reset so you're

177
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,910
just the whole manner of things that

178
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:05,970
don't necessarily fall in line with that

179
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:09,210
concept of a mission so as we bring this

180
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:13,260
back up again you know what are we here

181
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:15,150
for now or what are we here for again we

182
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:19,530
want to find badness we want to protect

183
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:22,140
users so if you have a mission if your

184
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:24,719
mission is simple it allows for a little

185
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:28,560
flexibility but it also allows you to

186
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,030
stay on that mission so you you can

187
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,920
really start to have this conversation

188
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:33,989
as you do stuff well network

189
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:36,030
configuration changes does that help me

190
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:41,250
find badness does that help me protect

191
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:42,690
my users well not really okay so maybe I

192
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,580
shouldn't do that maybe I should find

193
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:46,770
some other team or maybe we should work

194
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:49,590
on process and procedure it puts this

195
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:50,789
where it should go if we go through some

196
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:52,469
of the others dealing with a mountain of

197
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:54,330
alerts that we have no control over that

198
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:56,220
one becomes really interesting from a

199
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:58,530
mission perspective because yeah maybe

200
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:00,840
last eaten last month I dealt with 5,000

201
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:04,770
alerts did any of them turn into

202
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:06,900
something were any of them bad am i so

203
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,969
alert fatigued at this point that I'm

204
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,739
not gonna recognize bad from good which

205
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:15,120
we'll talk about alert fatigue a little

206
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:17,430
bit more as we go to but you know do we

207
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,680
really need those alerts do they help us

208
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:21,660
meet this mission you know as far as

209
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,470
only being able to escalate not fixing

210
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:26,190
security problems is that what we're

211
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:28,800
here for

212
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:31,830
are we protecting our users by not

213
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,560
fixing some of these core problems you

214
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:36,510
know no same thing with you know lucasz

215
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:40,439
or finding any cons like are we really

216
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:42,299
are we not here to stop the bat and can

217
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,840
we not fit this concept of understanding

218
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:49,020
how the bad got in and what happened in

219
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:50,640
to fixing the problem holistically is if

220
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:52,800
we can fix the problem holistically then

221
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,420
we might not have that problem again to

222
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,400
me that absolutely fits into this

223
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:58,349
mission statement that we have becomes

224
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:01,020
really really important

225
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:04,470
so let's go into the next one lack of

226
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:06,090
trust in soft personnel you're gonna see

227
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:08,400
a lot of these same issues over and over

228
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:09,690
again specifically you know in this one

229
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,370
we're dealing with the mountain of

230
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:13,020
alerts that we have no control over

231
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:15,660
we're not empowered to find that cause

232
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:17,370
we can't fix the problems we're given

233
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,780
little to no trust and it becomes a

234
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,570
stepping stone or something that you can

235
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:23,610
get out this one is particularly

236
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:28,350
different though and particularly

237
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:30,930
important because and I just want to

238
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:34,470
kind of remind everybody of something as

239
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:37,079
we break into this you hired him right

240
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:39,020
like in my fruit and in my perspective I

241
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:41,820
did hire the people that are on my team

242
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:44,550
every person who is hired from from my

243
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:46,830
intern some I see so was hired for that

244
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:49,290
job for a reason they had a skill it's

245
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:50,850
something that they could do because of

246
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:52,980
that it is my belief that they deserve

247
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:55,560
an equal voice and they deserve trust

248
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:59,250
and we have to trust what they have to

249
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:00,390
say I've had a saying for a long time

250
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,500
and I believe I've said it at almost

251
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:04,650
every sock that I've ever run

252
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:07,620
specifically to my leadership or you

253
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:11,819
know peer teams everybody has an opinion

254
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:13,920
on sock however there are very few

255
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,690
people who have to do the actual work

256
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,839
day in and day out

257
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:21,450
so you end up with that issue where well

258
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:23,580
I think sock should be looking at this I

259
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:27,180
think it's tuned well enough I think

260
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:28,800
it's okay I think everything is fine but

261
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:30,390
they don't have to then go do that work

262
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,560
they don't have to put up with it they

263
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:35,670
don't have to deal with it they don't

264
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:37,380
have to go through it in sock is really

265
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:40,439
interesting in the cyber security field

266
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:42,510
at least for my personal experience it

267
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:45,360
tends to be one of the only departments

268
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:47,130
in security programs especially for some

269
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,880
of the bigger companies where the team

270
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:52,820
that's doing the work often

271
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:56,150
time's has very little say over what

272
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:57,350
work they're doing and just stop and

273
00:10:56,150 --> 00:11:00,470
think about that for a second I'm gonna

274
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm gonna have another drink but if you

275
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:03,640
really stop and think about that like

276
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,750
conceptually you know if you're a

277
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:09,140
consultant if you're an engineer like

278
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:11,030
you're often telling your bosses this is

279
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:12,500
what we should be doing this is the

280
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:16,040
direction we should be going this is why

281
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:18,380
I'm doing that but saw specifically

282
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,880
oftentimes people go to their manager

283
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:24,439
they go up and they say we should be

284
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:27,080
doing this and they go well you know no

285
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,700
we're not gonna do that but you know I'm

286
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:31,760
dealing with five thousand alerts a day

287
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:33,800
I can't handle it well you're just gonna

288
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:37,180
have to find a way to do it like sorry

289
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:40,760
it just kind of is what it is

290
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:44,089
get used to it move forward push on and

291
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:46,130
you'll be fine so the one of the things

292
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:48,710
that I've found in both running socks

293
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:50,120
and and being them primarily being in

294
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:52,550
them which is why I don't tend to run

295
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,410
them that way is because so often these

296
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:55,609
people aren't given a voice maybe it's

297
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:57,439
because they're the least and

298
00:11:55,610 --> 00:12:00,950
experienced individuals there but that

299
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:03,800
doesn't make them any less valuable than

300
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:05,690
anybody else if anything they're a blank

301
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,520
slate they can bring in brand new ideas

302
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:10,100
they don't have years and years of bias

303
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:12,949
associated from working at other places

304
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:15,620
or you know their own set opinions of

305
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:17,780
the industry so like it's really

306
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:19,910
important to take that fresh look and

307
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:21,530
that non biased understanding and then

308
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:24,370
really let people do things and that

309
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:28,040
kind of brings us into the next topic

310
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:30,260
this concept of tiered structures and

311
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,819
swimlanes there's a lot of really

312
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:34,220
interesting pieces that we can pack

313
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:38,080
about pack apart here I'm gonna be

314
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:40,760
honest this is this is a massive topic

315
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:42,620
not just this one but this whole talk so

316
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,819
like the concept that I I'm absolutely

317
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:45,020
going to forget some things that are

318
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:47,380
absolutely going to be some things that

319
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:49,340
I don't cover I apologize for this I am

320
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:51,110
more than happy to have this

321
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:52,520
conversation and talk way more in depth

322
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:55,630
ly about any of these with anybody who

323
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:57,430
wants to reach out though to

324
00:12:55,630 --> 00:13:00,490
and swim wins end up putting you in this

325
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:03,819
position where like because you're Tier

326
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:06,250
one you definitely can't fix stuff you

327
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:09,160
definitely can't find root cause you're

328
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:11,410
just looking you click buttons you deal

329
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,180
with this mountain of alerts that you

330
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:15,939
have little to no control over and you

331
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:18,069
click buttons and oftentimes that leads

332
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:20,020
you into this over reliance on tools and

333
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:21,430
again it's a stepping stone it's

334
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:23,800
something to move on from something to

335
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:25,420
get out of it's something that I don't

336
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,579
want to do this for more than a year and

337
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:30,280
then I want to go do something cool well

338
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:32,230
here's the thing being a sock analyst

339
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:34,180
and the right sock is really cool but

340
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:35,800
let's let's talk about this a little bit

341
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:39,160
more before we get into how cool it can

342
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,359
be you know there's a there's a lot of

343
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,250
really good studies out that talk about

344
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:45,130
how many things people can look at per

345
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:49,240
day roughly an analyst can look at about

346
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:51,250
eight alerts a day he's a bit of a

347
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,020
different model but it's still really

348
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:55,860
interesting when you look at more than

349
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:58,900
eight they start to get overwhelmed and

350
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:00,910
you come into this big over reliance on

351
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,319
tools so I interview for an analyst and

352
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:03,610
I have probably interviewed hundreds and

353
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,310
hundreds of analysts and I can tell you

354
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:09,670
that I don't ask a single technical like

355
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:10,359
let me take that back I ask technical

356
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:12,729
questions

357
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,770
I don't ask a single tool based question

358
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:16,960
I don't ask a single memorisation based

359
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:19,000
question I asked very theoretical

360
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,190
questions so you know what would you do

361
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,660
like if I put a suspicious email in

362
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:24,160
front of you what would you look for and

363
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:28,399
then we follow that path all the way

364
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:31,589
through investigation issue what

365
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:34,140
where were my thoughts on that one one

366
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:38,130
of the things from these interviews that

367
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:40,680
I find out is gross majority not a gross

368
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:44,760
but a decent majority of the people that

369
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:47,640
I interview unfortunately they're stuck

370
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:49,260
in the tool so they go well I would look

371
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:51,480
at fire ihx and I would see what that

372
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:54,060
says I would look at crowd striker you

373
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,550
know I'll go to my right fire power

374
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:58,410
devices and I'll look at that and when

375
00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:00,899
you really start to dig into like what

376
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:04,170
happens after that why did that thing

377
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:07,050
fire why is this a thing you don't get a

378
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:09,000
lot of answers that exists there and I

379
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:11,160
think that that's a problem a really big

380
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,050
problem with not only you know the way

381
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,279
we run Sox today with this concept of a

382
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:17,790
tiered structure there's no

383
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:19,880
encouragement to learn so I'll let the

384
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:24,000
gift play real quick here for a second

385
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:25,740
and then we'll continue on so so I asked

386
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,510
everybody and I encourage people to ask

387
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:31,800
the question like why put a stopper on

388
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:33,720
progression like really why put up an

389
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:36,120
artificial barrier on somebody who wants

390
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,230
to do well why tell your intern that

391
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,209
they can't touch a thing

392
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:40,649
why tell your brand new hire fresh out

393
00:15:39,209 --> 00:15:44,910
of college that they're not allowed to

394
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:48,720
investigate this I quit I actually quit

395
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:49,890
my second InfoSec job because I was told

396
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,630
you're not allowed to do malware

397
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:53,790
analysis that's what the tier three

398
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:55,140
people do well how am I supposed to

399
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:56,689
learn so I can get to tier three well

400
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:59,910
that's not our problem

401
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:01,589
but but why why do we need the

402
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:05,519
artificial barrier why does that have to

403
00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:09,240
exist so I would encourage anybody have

404
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:11,100
tears but do it based on expectations my

405
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,760
brand new guy right out of college I'm

406
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:16,980
not gonna expect the same thing from him

407
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:18,689
or her but I expect from somebody who's

408
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:21,420
been with me for a long time or is it

409
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:23,880
Tier three so to speak but it doesn't

410
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:27,060
mean I'm not gonna let him do the same

411
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:29,760
things he's perfectly capable and

412
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:32,250
allowed to try his hand at doing all

413
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:34,529
these things in fact that's how he's

414
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:36,029
gonna grow that's how he's gonna learn

415
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:37,770
more and that's how he's going to become

416
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:40,470
more valuable to me in the long term or

417
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:41,410
her so it becomes really really

418
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:44,290
important

419
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:47,290
so to not wall people in if you want to

420
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:49,269
do this effective so now you know we

421
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:51,910
have the the concept of being walled in

422
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:55,660
like just on the sock side so now we'll

423
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:58,269
pivot over to the non socks I will have

424
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:59,800
it a segmentation infighting ego the

425
00:16:58,269 --> 00:17:03,639
things that happen with the sock and

426
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:05,379
everybody around them oftentimes you'll

427
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:08,620
see friction amongst like sock and I our

428
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:11,530
team's or sock and detection teams so if

429
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:14,698
we like break and get like layout

430
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:17,678
thought process he here for a second

431
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:19,510
there's really you know oftentimes

432
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,890
you'll have a sock and an ir team and

433
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:24,789
maybe a detection team and that's just

434
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:26,350
within like the one group right but if

435
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:28,150
you do that you can have kind of a

436
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:30,850
couple different setups where sock will

437
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:32,289
build all the detection x' or soccer

438
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,789
bill none of the defections and have no

439
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:35,860
say or you can kind of do a hybrid where

440
00:17:33,789 --> 00:17:37,809
the sock teams the ir teams where

441
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,760
everybody kind of submits use cases then

442
00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:41,830
they get prioritized the detection team

443
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,570
is the expert on the tool where the

444
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:45,220
engineer builds those things and then

445
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:47,139
they provide them to the sock because to

446
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:49,659
be completely honest and i'm very for

447
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:51,640
this method however this method is very

448
00:17:49,659 --> 00:17:54,130
hard to pull off because of this problem

449
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:57,490
this segmentation the infighting in the

450
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:59,169
ego because you know people start to

451
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:01,510
think they're better or it's just the

452
00:17:59,169 --> 00:18:02,530
sock people or they don't really know

453
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:04,299
what they're talking about

454
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:06,399
the reason that i'm so for at those

455
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:08,408
because everybody kinda like has an

456
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,750
expertise and it's very hard to say i'm

457
00:18:08,409 --> 00:18:12,760
a excellent engineer i can i'm a

458
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:14,140
mastermind on our site or Splunk or

459
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,610
whatever and i can go build all this

460
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,140
really cool stuff and i can make all

461
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:18,668
these awesome things and i can make them

462
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,330
work and be efficient and awesome and

463
00:18:18,669 --> 00:18:21,909
blah blah blah

464
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:24,158
oh and also I'm a master investigator

465
00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:25,780
and I can do log files and so on top of

466
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:27,370
that I can go do forensics and stuff too

467
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:28,960
so I don't necessarily disagree

468
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:31,510
especially when you get into a bigger

469
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,820
company and at a relatively large

470
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:35,470
company and having some of that

471
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:37,899
segmentation but that segmentation of

472
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:41,470
individual talent pieces that doesn't

473
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:43,750
make anybody worth less everybody just

474
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:44,919
has their role and then people can lean

475
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:47,460
across the fence and they can learn more

476
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:49,390
about other roles and that's important

477
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,190
one of the other problems that you have

478
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:52,780
is not just within internal teams and

479
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:54,549
partner teams but you might run into a

480
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,260
lot of issues with you know when you

481
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:57,770
want to fix

482
00:18:55,260 --> 00:19:01,230
new problems but when you have you know

483
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:03,420
low logs or you need to go out to to

484
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:05,550
other teams or like the IT departments

485
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:08,700
or like the help desk there's often a

486
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:11,610
lot of friction that exists there often

487
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:14,940
for the same reason so it's important to

488
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:18,290
be kind of understanding of that as we

489
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:23,430
go into this and we'll kind of dive into

490
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:25,590
so let's talk about that really what's

491
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:27,180
important in any of these cases is that

492
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:30,929
none of us lose sight of the mission

493
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:33,480
what we're here to do your personal let

494
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:35,940
you go doesn't really matter and it

495
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,500
doesn't help the business but here's my

496
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:39,510
suggestion and this one's a little bit

497
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:44,400
harder because often times you you don't

498
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:46,980
necessarily have control here right but

499
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,470
but killing with honey form strong

500
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:51,240
partnerships early work with these other

501
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:54,090
teams understand where they're coming

502
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:57,680
from and what their thoughts are but

503
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:59,699
still be able to make yourself hurt and

504
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:03,510
additionally from like a leadership

505
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:05,910
perspective make sure that you explain

506
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:07,920
well to your leadership why you make the

507
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:10,440
decisions that you make have a business

508
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:12,660
case understand that concept of a

509
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:16,290
business case and really that's just

510
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:18,390
justifying yourself with data and really

511
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:19,889
being able to say I have this data that

512
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:22,050
leads me to believe that this is the

513
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:24,780
best way to go and this can be anything

514
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:26,370
from I'd like to institute a new policy

515
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:29,610
that where we start blocking IP

516
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:32,189
addresses - you know I'd really think we

517
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:36,240
should have this detection because our

518
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:37,710
sector is law and law sector says you

519
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,440
know I'm reading threat reports about

520
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:42,690
bla sector so all those things become

521
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,100
really important but then we'll dive

522
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:46,470
into kinda the next one and that next

523
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:48,408
one really is this need to justify

524
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:50,000
itself to the business

525
00:20:48,409 --> 00:20:51,830
I'm gonna I'm gonna say a word that

526
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,940
everybody is gonna instantly groan I'm

527
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:54,559
just gonna hear a whole bunch of well

528
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:56,870
I'm not gonna hear anything cuz I can't

529
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:58,039
because this is virtual typically if I

530
00:20:56,870 --> 00:21:02,018
were to give this in person I would

531
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:06,590
expect to hear a bunch of Uggs metrics

532
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:09,889
the importance of them however also how

533
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:12,320
often they're misused in these lead to a

534
00:21:09,889 --> 00:21:14,209
lot of things low visibility over

535
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,769
reliance on tools but specifically

536
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:18,470
dealing with a mountain of alerts that

537
00:21:15,769 --> 00:21:20,330
you have no control over this is one of

538
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:23,059
the biggest things about metrics because

539
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:25,428
when most people think metrics in a sock

540
00:21:23,059 --> 00:21:26,960
they go well sock handles alerts the

541
00:21:25,429 --> 00:21:29,240
number of alerts that the handle clearly

542
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,269
says how well they do their job so if

543
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:35,240
Jimmy closes 5,000 alerts and Ben closes

544
00:21:32,269 --> 00:21:37,250
$1,000 Ben's not a good employee Ben

545
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:40,580
should probably be fired why is it been

546
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:42,529
working as hard also hey executive look

547
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:44,750
we closed 10,000 alerts all together

548
00:21:42,529 --> 00:21:46,129
like we're awesome like we closed 5,000

549
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:48,559
more alerts than we did last month look

550
00:21:46,129 --> 00:21:51,019
how good we are that's awesome really

551
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:54,940
cool this is where we need to be this is

552
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:57,379
what we need to care about so I

553
00:21:54,940 --> 00:22:00,200
hopefully there are some groans maybe

554
00:21:57,379 --> 00:22:03,980
not but hopefully so let's talk about

555
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:05,539
that a little bit also I would like to

556
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:07,129
present to you the Internet which is one

557
00:22:05,539 --> 00:22:10,730
of just my favorite things in the world

558
00:22:07,129 --> 00:22:13,519
so you know spin a good yarn it's not

559
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:16,340
just about telling a story it's about

560
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:19,580
telling the right story

561
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:21,740
I can't impress the importance of that

562
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:25,279
enough that I'm going to say it a second

563
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:28,309
time metrics are important but it's not

564
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:31,970
about telling a story it's about telling

565
00:22:28,309 --> 00:22:36,980
the right story it's about being open

566
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:40,549
and clear and honest you need to talk

567
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:41,990
about the ups and the downs if you go

568
00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:44,658
into a meeting with your seaso and you

569
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:46,700
go this is where I am that individual

570
00:22:44,659 --> 00:22:48,440
should leave that meeting going this is

571
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,899
good work but I'm still worried about

572
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:53,840
these things what that means is that

573
00:22:50,899 --> 00:22:56,510
you've been honest with him also

574
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,158
interestingly enough and I think there

575
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:59,720
was a talk earlier about executives

576
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,460
protecting themselves and I caught a

577
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,899
little bit of this

578
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:05,029
there's a saying that I've said a lot

579
00:23:02,899 --> 00:23:09,039
you're very unlikely to get a life raft

580
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:11,539
unless you're drowning in the world so

581
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:13,279
you really need to have this concept in

582
00:23:11,539 --> 00:23:15,980
this focus of like I need to be honest

583
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:18,620
so I'll tell you I was at a managed

584
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:21,230
service provider once upon a time no I'm

585
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:22,580
not gonna say where but one of the

586
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:24,890
things that I started looking at is

587
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:27,110
analyst work look in work flow capacity

588
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:28,610
in capacity is something that's

589
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:29,928
fascinating to me because it's always

590
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:31,309
gonna be a little rough there's not

591
00:23:29,929 --> 00:23:33,620
really a good way to do it perfectly but

592
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:35,178
you can get an idea of what things look

593
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,949
like in this case was just taking the

594
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:38,840
total number of analyst hours that I had

595
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:40,730
versus the alerts that were coming in

596
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:42,709
for the clients that we had saying what

597
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:45,289
does that look like how much time do

598
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:48,770
these guys have perler it's such a

599
00:23:45,289 --> 00:23:51,890
powerful number if anybody's curious the

600
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:53,750
number was 3.5 minutes so I had a team

601
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:56,690
of analysts who had three point five

602
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:59,779
minutes perler to investigate make a

603
00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:02,360
determination in close if any of them

604
00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:04,429
actually involved more investigation and

605
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:07,010
took longer that would hurt the rest of

606
00:24:04,429 --> 00:24:09,830
the team because more alerts were going

607
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:13,039
to come in so why is that so strong

608
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:16,158
that's so strong because we could we

609
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:19,520
used that goal to enact change we said

610
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:21,710
hey we need to buckle down and focus on

611
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,149
tuning we need to fix this because the

612
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:25,580
gross majority of this stuff is false

613
00:24:23,149 --> 00:24:27,229
positive as well so we really need to

614
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:29,330
buckle down and we really need to fix

615
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:33,409
this and and I use a method if anybody's

616
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:35,750
curious fidelity frequency and impact so

617
00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:39,200
how bad is it what is the overall

618
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:40,820
fidelity like how often is it false

619
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,399
positive true positive and then

620
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:45,918
frequency how often it fires and I kind

621
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:48,739
of rate on that triangle to make tuning

622
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:50,929
decisions but because I had that number

623
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:52,580
we were able to say you know what next

624
00:24:50,929 --> 00:24:54,110
quarter we want that to be five minutes

625
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:57,199
and you want to say five minutes not a

626
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:58,789
big deal but it's true it's not but it's

627
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,559
moving in the right direction

628
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:03,950
it's moving forward and strong

629
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:05,539
incremental steps are helpful so this

630
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:08,299
concept of being able to have numbers

631
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:10,789
and tell your story like it's about

632
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:12,710
knowing what story you want to tell and

633
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:14,279
then being able to tell it I've taken

634
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:15,840
the capacity stuff that I've done

635
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:17,580
they're to almost every place that are

636
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,709
gone because I find it to be so

637
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:22,109
interesting so cool - no but I have

638
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:24,779
expanded on but we're going to talk

639
00:25:22,109 --> 00:25:28,529
about that as we get into kind of a use

640
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:30,119
case but it's not just things like that

641
00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:32,039
it's understanding your threat model

642
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:33,389
understanding where your focus is like

643
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:34,919
those are things that are important

644
00:25:33,389 --> 00:25:37,289
most of the threats that come in are

645
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:37,950
they email well cool what are we doing

646
00:25:37,289 --> 00:25:40,739
on email

647
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:41,879
oh if 90% of our threats are actually

648
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:44,820
email like the rest of the industry

649
00:25:41,879 --> 00:25:49,859
maybe I now have a use case to go get

650
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:51,689
email if I can't verify stuff and I have

651
00:25:49,859 --> 00:25:53,309
so many things that are unverified or I

652
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:54,599
couldn't verify like what website

653
00:25:53,309 --> 00:25:56,908
somebody actually downloaded something

654
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:58,468
from I now have a business use case in a

655
00:25:56,909 --> 00:26:00,690
justification potentially to go get a

656
00:25:58,469 --> 00:26:02,940
web proxy I can show why those things

657
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:04,619
matter and that's really important as

658
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:07,379
being able to back up what matters with

659
00:26:04,619 --> 00:26:09,749
that I know everybody hates metrics and

660
00:26:07,379 --> 00:26:13,228
hates numbers but I guarantee you they

661
00:26:09,749 --> 00:26:15,419
don't have to be bad trust me they don't

662
00:26:13,229 --> 00:26:19,619
they can be used for good and they can

663
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:21,679
be used honestly so lastly because

664
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:24,839
that's how it's done

665
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:28,469
everywhere this concept of industry

666
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:29,759
standard basically all the problems can

667
00:26:28,469 --> 00:26:32,129
fall in because that's how it's done

668
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:33,749
everywhere it's it's not uncommon for

669
00:26:32,129 --> 00:26:35,849
somebody to say I'd really like to have

670
00:26:33,749 --> 00:26:38,129
a chat with you about what an industry

671
00:26:35,849 --> 00:26:41,010
standard sockets or you know my

672
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:42,629
understanding of the industry stand

673
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:45,810
I'm really not gonna justify this one

674
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:47,510
because my response is always I don't

675
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:50,060
think the industry standards very good

676
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:52,410
plus why should we be held to that

677
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:54,300
brings me to a really interesting point

678
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:58,170
and this one actually makes me really

679
00:26:54,300 --> 00:27:00,690
angry most of the time we are hackers we

680
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:03,480
challenge norms we innovate we adapt we

681
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:07,200
fight for the right change that's what

682
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:09,210
we're here for that's what we do so so

683
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,910
why do we talk about industry standard

684
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:15,570
like it's something that has to exist

685
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:17,610
why that's my curiosity why is it that

686
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:19,889
we need to go down this path of being

687
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:22,199
like everybody else it's so it's it's

688
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:24,570
the antithesis to basically our entire

689
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:29,400
identities as tinker's and changers and

690
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:32,760
people who fight side tangent but still

691
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:35,640
one worth talking about I think so we're

692
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:37,440
gonna put this all together and this is

693
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,940
just gonna be me talking so there's it's

694
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,890
not really a slide after this so I'm

695
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:43,970
gonna talk for a little let's take all

696
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:48,330
this stuff and let's put it together so

697
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:50,280
first we come in we have a sock what's

698
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:52,139
the mission of that sock I'm gonna use

699
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:55,440
the one that I laid out find badness

700
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:57,900
protect users so we have that mission we

701
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,690
can now start to ask a lot of really

702
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:02,370
good questions and I'm actually gonna

703
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:04,200
give a shout out to mark Orlando's

704
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:06,899
building a sock a team talk which you

705
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,640
should totally listen to because he

706
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:10,980
talks a bit about this concept of state

707
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:14,100
of flux this stuff changes all the time

708
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:15,390
and asked you I've had employees who

709
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,679
when I would go into a place and I would

710
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:18,390
start doing stuff would go hey when are

711
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:20,340
we gonna get too stable and I would say

712
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:22,230
this is the new normal I'm not

713
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:24,750
interested in said well that's okay I

714
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:27,049
mean I you're welcome to stay when you

715
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:28,759
find a new job awesome

716
00:28:27,049 --> 00:28:30,559
part of meeting that mission is asking

717
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:33,230
some questions so that first question is

718
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:34,369
are we gonna get to a state of done well

719
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:36,889
no not really

720
00:28:34,369 --> 00:28:37,639
attackers change all the time we have to

721
00:28:36,889 --> 00:28:39,229
change too

722
00:28:37,639 --> 00:28:42,559
new technology comes out new things

723
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:45,080
there is no done in defensive work it's

724
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:48,918
just not a thing so we can't pretend

725
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:51,769
that it is as we continue down into that

726
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:53,600
mission we start really quantifying this

727
00:28:51,769 --> 00:28:56,539
concept of like okay so how do we meet

728
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:59,629
that what do we do to meet our mission

729
00:28:56,539 --> 00:29:01,220
well nobody else is looking at alert so

730
00:28:59,629 --> 00:29:03,379
we should probably do that especially

731
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:04,519
because you know there's there's

732
00:29:03,379 --> 00:29:06,199
something to be said about having

733
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:09,980
consistent alerting it's not something

734
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:11,539
that I disagree with so what do we need

735
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:13,609
to set up what does our threat model

736
00:29:11,539 --> 00:29:17,179
potentially look like what are we

737
00:29:13,609 --> 00:29:18,439
worried about okay let's set up a core

738
00:29:17,179 --> 00:29:19,940
set of alerts none of that

739
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,289
out-of-the-box crap if we're gonna set

740
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:23,600
up the out-of-the-box crap that's cool

741
00:29:21,289 --> 00:29:26,779
but we got to customize it we got to do

742
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,340
it slow we can't fall into that trap of

743
00:29:26,779 --> 00:29:30,169
being buried under a mountain of alerts

744
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:31,580
and having alert fatigue problems and

745
00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:35,869
having analysts you can't do it like

746
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:37,309
human beings need not just consistency

747
00:29:35,869 --> 00:29:38,418
but like human beings need a bit of a

748
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:39,859
challenge if you give them the same

749
00:29:38,419 --> 00:29:40,909
thing over and over again they're gonna

750
00:29:39,859 --> 00:29:43,939
get bored and they're gonna make

751
00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:45,230
mistakes so okay we need alerts but we

752
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:47,720
know that we need those alerts to be

753
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:49,999
interesting investigate able not just a

754
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,769
bunch of crap to make our numbers cool

755
00:29:49,999 --> 00:29:53,749
so we're getting somewhere

756
00:29:51,769 --> 00:29:56,480
so we know we have that how are we gonna

757
00:29:53,749 --> 00:29:57,739
get those well we have threat models we

758
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,809
can look at that we can look at what's

759
00:29:57,739 --> 00:30:02,899
normal in the industry I had mentioned

760
00:29:59,809 --> 00:30:05,210
you know 91% of attacks start with a

761
00:30:02,899 --> 00:30:06,949
fish well okay maybe we should let start

762
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:09,259
focusing on male that's a good place to

763
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:11,029
start if you're a window shop most

764
00:30:09,259 --> 00:30:12,320
malware's powershell starts with

765
00:30:11,029 --> 00:30:15,080
powershell hey that's a cool place to

766
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:17,239
start too so let's start thinking about

767
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,590
how early we can catch something because

768
00:30:17,239 --> 00:30:20,090
what are we here for here to find

769
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:21,949
badness we're here to protect users so

770
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:24,109
how early in that chain can you find

771
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:27,080
something how early in that chain can we

772
00:30:24,109 --> 00:30:28,699
stop something from happening that

773
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:30,439
becomes really important to cuz it's not

774
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,730
like well I don't really care about the

775
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,830
email until somebody clicks on it

776
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:36,269
there's an infection for every analyst

777
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:39,299
who's ever told me phishing is for noobs

778
00:30:36,269 --> 00:30:40,409
that analyst can right off and this

779
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:42,658
might have been the first time I'm sworn

780
00:30:40,409 --> 00:30:45,690
in in this entire talk which is uncommon

781
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:48,629
but still attackers use it it's

782
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:51,539
important and guess what stopping that

783
00:30:48,629 --> 00:30:54,178
email rather than stopping somebody's

784
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:56,999
exposed credentials or exposed data or a

785
00:30:54,179 --> 00:30:59,909
piece of malware is by far the better

786
00:30:56,999 --> 00:31:01,769
way to go lower risk again when you

787
00:30:59,909 --> 00:31:03,149
start talking about numbers though you

788
00:31:01,769 --> 00:31:04,739
start to use that well you know we

789
00:31:03,149 --> 00:31:06,119
stopped this many emails which means we

790
00:31:04,739 --> 00:31:08,099
stopped this many potential security

791
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:11,759
threats our job is to stop potential

792
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:13,259
security threats cool so we've got some

793
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:14,789
things we kind of know how we want to

794
00:31:13,259 --> 00:31:16,379
build some detection x' and stuff we

795
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:19,408
figure out whom i need to build that we

796
00:31:16,379 --> 00:31:21,449
kind of work through that cool so what

797
00:31:19,409 --> 00:31:23,820
else can what else do we need obviously

798
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:27,089
we need more than just you know alarms

799
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:30,299
coming in right otherwise we're not

800
00:31:27,089 --> 00:31:32,129
really gonna meet that mission so well

801
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:33,749
how can we break that out so I'll tell

802
00:31:32,129 --> 00:31:36,509
you what I've done and what's worked for

803
00:31:33,749 --> 00:31:39,419
me I say you know what I'm gonna build a

804
00:31:36,509 --> 00:31:40,769
capacity mou and I do and I say this is

805
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:42,389
how many alerts I'm anticipating are

806
00:31:40,769 --> 00:31:44,039
gonna come in this is the percentage but

807
00:31:42,389 --> 00:31:45,029
before all that I do a couple things I

808
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:46,559
take off a little bit of time for

809
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:48,179
overhead because it's important people

810
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:49,918
need to talk to each other go to the

811
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:51,719
bathroom do all those things in the

812
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:54,539
consulting world we ran at what's called

813
00:31:51,719 --> 00:31:57,239
70% utilization so the expectation was

814
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:59,609
that we were working or billable 70% of

815
00:31:57,239 --> 00:32:01,469
the time I carry that into my teams I

816
00:31:59,609 --> 00:32:04,678
expect them to be at about 70 percent

817
00:32:01,469 --> 00:32:06,570
utilization however before I even get

818
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:09,239
into running numbers across how many

819
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:10,349
alerts they handle I go you know what if

820
00:32:09,239 --> 00:32:11,309
I want to get an understanding what

821
00:32:10,349 --> 00:32:14,039
we're doing and I want to know what

822
00:32:11,309 --> 00:32:17,729
they're doing I break that up so I say

823
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:20,729
we're gonna put 15 percent of each

824
00:32:17,729 --> 00:32:23,399
analysts time on a weekly hunt rotation

825
00:32:20,729 --> 00:32:25,229
or a weekly log source rotation what

826
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:26,748
that means is hey we've got some low

827
00:32:25,229 --> 00:32:29,039
fidelity stuff that exists out there

828
00:32:26,749 --> 00:32:30,719
maybe we've got some log sources that

829
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:32,519
are interesting maybe we just want to go

830
00:32:30,719 --> 00:32:34,980
troll through data and see if we can

831
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:37,020
find something that sticks out

832
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:40,020
15% of each analyst time is spent doing

833
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:43,770
that across multiple log sources then I

834
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:46,200
take another 15% they say hey 15 percent

835
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:48,660
of your time is going to is also going

836
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,610
to be done or you know in addition to

837
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:54,210
you're going to spend another 15 percent

838
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:56,459
on a monthly rotation in that rotation

839
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:59,340
can be things like documentation which

840
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:01,830
is really boring but it's necessary

841
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:03,990
especially as we talk about maturity but

842
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:05,970
it can also be learning a new tool or

843
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:07,590
doing research which is something that I

844
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:09,660
think is really really important for

845
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:11,970
sake analysts one of my research kind of

846
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:13,559
expectations is that you come out of

847
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:14,940
that with an understanding of a breach

848
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:18,020
and how we can detect detect

849
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:20,400
order pick a mitre attack category or

850
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:23,760
tell me how we can detect something that

851
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:25,860
exists there do it work investigate how

852
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,600
this stuff works set up some VMs do all

853
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:29,219
that stuff look into it and figure

854
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:32,668
something out and make our program

855
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:35,040
better because that's how we show that

856
00:33:32,669 --> 00:33:37,440
we're getting better and when we talk

857
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:39,360
about the metric stuff the number of

858
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,000
alerts doesn't really matter we can't do

859
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,439
anything with that we don't control how

860
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,470
many alerts come in you know we do

861
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:50,450
control though we control this concept

862
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:53,790
of do we see more than we used to see

863
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:57,720
are we looking for things in new ways

864
00:33:53,790 --> 00:34:00,330
are we covering our bases and our attack

865
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,410
bases mitre is really cool for this the

866
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:03,090
muddier attack framework and I know

867
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:04,320
people beat it to death and talk so I'm

868
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:07,530
only going to mention it for a second

869
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:09,060
but it's really cool to say hey you know

870
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:13,230
we have detection for this many mitre

871
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:14,940
categories and we're constantly building

872
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:16,918
more and in the last month we built like

873
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:18,540
four more things we expanded our

874
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:20,368
visibility we have new log sources we

875
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:22,320
have new stuff that's how you sure you

876
00:34:20,369 --> 00:34:26,070
got better that's how you tell that

877
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:27,690
story that says we got better we don't

878
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:29,990
control how many alerts come in we don't

879
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:32,790
control what the bad guys do or girls

880
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:34,020
what we do control is our ability to

881
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:36,929
look for things in new and interesting

882
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:38,489
ways it's really really important to

883
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:40,080
tell that story and then you know when

884
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:42,928
we talk about Brett model on all that

885
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:44,879
stuff so one of the other rotations is

886
00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:46,320
like a hunting exercise so doing a

887
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,290
month-long hunt with a bunch of other

888
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,520
teams

889
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:51,650
also a really interesting and valuable

890
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,239
thing it forces other teams to get

891
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:56,650
together and to work together it Spears

892
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:59,149
it moves everybody forward a little bit

893
00:34:56,650 --> 00:35:01,430
there's a lot of benefit in general to

894
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:03,680
doing it but coming out of anything like

895
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:05,870
that we also then meet and we talk about

896
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,730
okay what new detections might we have

897
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:10,069
there so that we can kind of complete

898
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:12,500
this concept of a life cycle that says

899
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:14,150
we went looking for this maybe we found

900
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:16,640
something maybe we don't but what worked

901
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:18,200
really well what can we codify what can

902
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,700
we make normal and then we basically

903
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:22,730
complete this life cycle but it's so

904
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:26,060
important for the analysts to continue

905
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:27,770
to do this and to think in this way and

906
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:30,140
think about kind of the big picture why

907
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:32,540
they're there what don't I see what

908
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:35,900
aren't I looking it's not just about

909
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:36,860
that alert that comes in so that you

910
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:39,440
know we talked a little bit about

911
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:41,420
capacity model so to continue down I

912
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,910
take 15 percent 15 percent right off

913
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:47,780
plus you know 30 percent off the top and

914
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:50,089
then I go okay so like average triage

915
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:51,740
not investigation triage maybe 15

916
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:53,270
minutes when we get into something

917
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:54,709
that's investigation worthy it's gonna

918
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:57,200
have a ticket let's give that some

919
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:58,760
additional time and then we start to

920
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,980
calculate the total number of events

921
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,480
that we have come in - all this other

922
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:04,220
stuff that I do want my people to do

923
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,950
because this stuff is important to me

924
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:09,770
and we can get a percentage we can get a

925
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:12,379
amount of time per event but we can also

926
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:15,620
get a percentage so we can say I'm at

927
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:17,390
112 percent well what that means is you

928
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:19,850
know my other stuff suffered because I

929
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:21,440
have 30 percent set aside for it but

930
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:25,130
what that means to me when I go to the

931
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:27,650
business is hey I need people or we need

932
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:29,180
to limit scope because these are the

933
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:30,410
things I expect my people to do and

934
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:32,660
they're not getting to them and here's

935
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:33,460
the proof here's the data here's how

936
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,450
this works

937
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:36,800
one thing that works really well with

938
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:39,790
this that we didn't really cover at all

939
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,960
because again the I in topic automation

940
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:44,660
you know can we bring in an automation

941
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:46,010
provider can we use a phantom Erdem isto

942
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:49,160
which I think my stuff has a new name

943
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:51,590
now and can we get rid of the crap and

944
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:54,410
again back to mission this stuff all

945
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:56,150
syncs together back to mission can we

946
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:58,460
get rid of all the stuff that doesn't

947
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:59,990
let us focus on the mission do I really

948
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,470
need to go do a whole bunch of data in

949
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:01,819
Richmond

950
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:04,129
but I really need to do a bunch of

951
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:06,079
ticket entry does that make sense is

952
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:08,089
that a good use of my paycheck and my

953
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:09,920
time or am I better off actually

954
00:37:08,089 --> 00:37:11,210
investigating things and then clicking a

955
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:15,200
button then having the ticket get made

956
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:16,910
for me that's what I'm for personal we

957
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,368
continue to talk about that concept of

958
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:23,450
building strong partnerships and then

959
00:37:19,369 --> 00:37:25,190
lastly really you know you reach out you

960
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:27,529
build these partnerships and you tell

961
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:29,000
your story and that's where things get

962
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:31,609
really important and we talked about

963
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,349
this a bit but hopefully coming through

964
00:37:31,609 --> 00:37:35,420
this you see you'll see that like you

965
00:37:33,349 --> 00:37:37,760
can tell this story you can solve these

966
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:39,680
problems and you could actually probably

967
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,460
talk to some of my employees and maybe

968
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,348
they tell you that none of these

969
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:43,730
problems have been solved I'd like to

970
00:37:42,349 --> 00:37:45,890
think that we were on a pretty cool shop

971
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:46,790
but I mean they are really the judge of

972
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:48,140
that not me

973
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:51,770
because they are the ones who have to do

974
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:54,020
this work every day not me but like it

975
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:56,300
gets so important to trust these people

976
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:58,750
let them do their job let them explore

977
00:37:56,300 --> 00:38:01,550
let them expand let them bring new ideas

978
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:03,650
because no one person knows everything

979
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:06,589
no one person is ever gonna know

980
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:08,540
everything if we hire somebody let's let

981
00:38:06,589 --> 00:38:10,940
them teach us something that's really

982
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:12,470
important and then let's use that and

983
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:16,369
let's tell our story let's talk about

984
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:18,859
why what do we do what are we really

985
00:38:16,369 --> 00:38:21,380
here for and how do we protect the

986
00:38:18,859 --> 00:38:24,589
company really protect the company

987
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:26,480
I'm not saying look at an email look at

988
00:38:24,589 --> 00:38:29,240
a phishing email and then open a ticket

989
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:31,250
I'm saying look at a phishing email go

990
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:33,319
look for it across the entire network

991
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:35,750
find out that it got sent to 300 people

992
00:38:33,319 --> 00:38:37,579
and then have 300 emails removed from

993
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:39,290
inboxes while you're simultaneously

994
00:38:37,579 --> 00:38:41,150
going and looking to see if anybody

995
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:42,800
interacted with it not just clicked on

996
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:44,540
it because ultimately that might not

997
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,770
matter most of the time but interacted

998
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:47,540
gave out credentials and then doing

999
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:49,460
credential resets and so on and so on

1000
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:50,660
and so on and so on so I'm looking for

1001
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:54,589
any place that those credentials are

1002
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:57,109
used that's the job in my opinion of the

1003
00:38:54,589 --> 00:39:01,160
job anyway and again opinions may vary

1004
00:38:57,109 --> 00:39:01,529
but that's the job and that's what I

1005
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,629
think

1006
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:07,650
I really want the rest of the

1007
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:11,490
industry-standard to get to I really

1008
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:14,820
want us to start focusing on why were

1009
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:16,379
there and not feeling like such as the

1010
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:18,720
boring place that people leave from

1011
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:20,520
because it doesn't have to be it really

1012
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:23,009
doesn't and hopefully throughout the

1013
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:24,450
course of this as I kind of jump to the

1014
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:25,859
last slide here there's some some

1015
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:28,230
contact details but hopefully through

1016
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:30,450
the course of this it you know I have

1017
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:32,369
taught or carried on some things or some

1018
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:33,960
ideas that maybe people who are doing

1019
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:36,330
this either in leadership or not in

1020
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:39,900
leadership either way can take home and

1021
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:41,580
really say hey maybe I should talk to my

1022
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:43,260
team about this or maybe this would be

1023
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:46,140
useful or if you're not on a sock team

1024
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:47,670
maybe take a minute and say hey maybe I

1025
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:49,500
should thank my sock team for the work

1026
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:51,060
they do and include them a little bit

1027
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,500
more because they know stuff and they're

1028
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:56,029
valuable and they have a very unique

1029
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:59,099
view into the country into you know

1030
00:39:56,030 --> 00:40:01,170
what's going on with all that being said

1031
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:03,570
I have a slide for questions but I

1032
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:05,340
assume as this has gone most of the time

1033
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:08,369
questions will be answered in the in the

1034
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:10,680
