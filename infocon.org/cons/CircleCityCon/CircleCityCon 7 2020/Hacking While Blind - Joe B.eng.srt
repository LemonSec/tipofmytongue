1
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:34,510
meanwhile blind I should through in a

2
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:36,129
2-foot but no because if you tended my

3
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:38,050
talk it derbycon I gave a very similar

4
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:41,680
talk but now that I've been given a

5
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:43,120
little bit more time so I'll be kind of

6
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,840
showing those examples that I talked

7
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,949
about and some the other things in a you

8
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,449
know talking about a little bit more

9
00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:51,160
about community and other additional

10
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:52,420
ways you can help out just be a just do

11
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,430
to feedback through the community and

12
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,500
things we've talked about so Who am I

13
00:00:54,430 --> 00:01:00,699
I'm the blind hacker a lot of people

14
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:02,860
know me as that let's see again I don't

15
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:05,470
consider myself really disabled just

16
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:10,120
differently-abled you know I function

17
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:14,950
pretty much 99% even with low vision so

18
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:16,270
there's that um so again you know being

19
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,280
differently able to say it feels the

20
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:20,470
better way to say some that today you

21
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:23,110
know I'm still have a disability I'm not

22
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:26,860
discounting that but ultimately I can do

23
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:28,210
a lot be because I am you know only

24
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:30,250
partially blind as opposed to fully

25
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:31,899
blind in you know I think that's a big

26
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:34,840
difference to state you know still a

27
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:36,400
goonie a gamer a nerd in a geek yes I

28
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,710
still game even with a visual impairment

29
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,390
you'll you'll begin to see si talk about

30
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:42,250
some of these slides I did get rid of us

31
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:47,170
from the slides that showed some samples

32
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:50,320
ultimately but there's that let's see so

33
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:52,030
still a I hear discord let me mute that

34
00:01:50,320 --> 00:02:11,319
real quick because that's gonna go

35
00:01:52,030 --> 00:02:12,940
bananas server let's see still a still a

36
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:14,859
gamer if you ever want to see that I

37
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:17,980
sometimes treat video games exciting

38
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:19,629
streamer but not not often honestly [ __ ]

39
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:22,060
educator admit sir I'm huge in that the

40
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:26,379
education specifically for cyber for

41
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:29,260
those that are here for free I do a lot

42
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:31,120
of stuff for free I you know very very

43
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,798
seldomly often ever put out a paid

44
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,250
course unless it's a certification based

45
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:37,810
course but then it's just a cut over the

46
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,870
cost really awful certifications things

47
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:43,730
like that um so my day job I'm hacker

48
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:46,849
pen tester and occasionally do some

49
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:48,530
red teaming when orcas allow current

50
00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:49,849
title actually is no longer directive

51
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:51,620
often security one thing I forgotten

52
00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:53,780
head of offensive security and

53
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:57,310
development so uh I scooch the the

54
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:59,870
development environment under my IT a

55
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:02,060
security budget in my company because we

56
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:03,739
are able to do a lot more with the

57
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,900
developers than just having them kind of

58
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:07,760
sit there which it's been a fantastic ad

59
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,280
because we've been able to complete a

60
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,370
ton of work

61
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,510
let's see community outreach big into

62
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:16,760
that again I reach out to a lot of

63
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:18,590
people I'm active on Twitter I can hold

64
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,380
social media just to you know let people

65
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:24,290
know that the you know I that I do the

66
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:27,049
rest of these things and then a big ally

67
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:29,090
advocate now ally with eight one one y

68
00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:30,560
means accessibility so again that's

69
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:33,980
doing things like screen readers screen

70
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,480
zoom people with disabilities so I try

71
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:38,390
to reach out and help as many of those

72
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,859
folks that I can I get a lot of people

73
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:41,899
reaching out to me tagging me on Twitter

74
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:45,680
and things like that so always put the

75
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:47,060
information so what I do again really

76
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,709
consider myself at a baseline

77
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:52,720
I don't think hacker security word

78
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:56,329
anymore um you know I deal with my

79
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,739
primarily my primary best spots for to

80
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:59,560
catch me in and that I'm most

81
00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:02,389
knowledgeable in his network systems I

82
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:05,090
didn't add some of you seen I've talked

83
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:06,290
about mobile stuff recently but I didn't

84
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:08,269
have a I don't think I'm proficient

85
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:10,760
there yet but I'm getting there

86
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:14,299
you know I love calling myself a modder

87
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:17,180
as well I love to grab either people's

88
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:19,548
codes I'm on video games still anytime

89
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:21,049
that I see it I've joined accessibility

90
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:24,109
mods for certain be older video games

91
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:26,780
that you know the DRM and things aren't

92
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:29,510
on there I love modding people's scripts

93
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:31,159
editing scripts and just kind of I'm not

94
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:33,889
great at starting things off but I'm

95
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,330
great at making them suit my needs I

96
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:37,669
don't ever want to say better let's do

97
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:39,650
my needs you know I love to Montt

98
00:04:37,669 --> 00:04:42,469
hardware and single-board computers

99
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:45,950
raspberry pies things like that not as

100
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:47,090
much into that as I used to be but

101
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:50,419
there's a there's a lot of cool stuff

102
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:52,429
that you can do with those right so and

103
00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:54,530
of course the blind hacker so blind

104
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:56,930
hacker I came up a lot of people know me

105
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:58,638
as Joe but joejoebee

106
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:00,560
just plenty of Joe's in the industry but

107
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,690
so I came up with the moniker Blaine

108
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,130
hacker so I am fishing currently blind

109
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:07,250
that caught my cool little logo here

110
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:09,740
using kind of the cybersecurity kind of

111
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:11,930
mock fraud behind it with the you know

112
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:14,600
with the symbol for the international

113
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:17,389
symbol for visually impaired so that

114
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,979
really to me became my this mine is who

115
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:20,630
I am it it's my personal but the moniker

116
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:22,039
states to let people know well you know

117
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:23,449
what else do I do people reach out to me

118
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:25,610
oh do you do these things well you know

119
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:28,400
again I'm a mentor teacher I'm a coach

120
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:31,070
I'd say take on everybody who comes to

121
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,929
my discord anybody who to messages me on

122
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:36,710
Twitter I try to help out as best I can

123
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:39,169
but within reasonable means right and it

124
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:42,880
and still of course do a plenty of

125
00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:46,130
community outreach there and that even

126
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,930
comes down to the thing or I've always

127
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:50,389
said you know I've always been told you

128
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:51,979
know act in the world act like you are

129
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:53,030
changing the world for the weight of the

130
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:55,099
world that you want to live in and

131
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:57,320
that's what I try to do with a lot of

132
00:05:55,099 --> 00:06:01,449
this the blind hack because it's it's a

133
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:05,690
more suitable name than Joby on Twitter

134
00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:07,310
so where I do it so again I wanted to

135
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:09,199
this is a new slide here if you saw my

136
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:11,419
prior talks of dead pixel what is dead

137
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,889
pixel that pixel is a online security

138
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:16,370
community I started I originally started

139
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:17,840
off just as a streamer you know the

140
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:20,180
Dysport was all about blind hacker but

141
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,770
within a few months I started in August

142
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:24,650
by March I realized it's no longer about

143
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:28,609
me so created this community dead pixel

144
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:30,888
that pixel sec it's been fantastic it

145
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:32,919
grows all the time if the doors are open

146
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:35,539
everybody's welcome to come in and join

147
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:39,320
we do have the standard community rule

148
00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:42,199
don't be a dick so you know you can join

149
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:46,430
using the link write the discord dead

150
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:49,509
pixel SATCOM so that's where I spend a

151
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:52,550
lot of my time it's pretty much home

152
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:54,849
again so I also do the grumpy hackers

153
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:58,159
podcast with which is a Wednesday night

154

Association just monthly meetings that

162
00:07:13,469 --> 00:07:18,599

163
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,979
I'm on Twitter I have an Instagram I

164
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:21,989
don't really know how to use it yet

165
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:23,878
there's a Facebook page I had which is

166
00:07:21,989 --> 00:07:27,529
hardly used but you can catch me all on

167
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:30,299
there they all kind of at least the face

168
00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:32,129
book in the Twitter the Facebook just

169
00:07:30,299 --> 00:07:34,289
retweets it so that's where I do it

170
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:36,659
so again joint death pixel sec you'll

171
00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:38,219
have access to me the community and

172
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:41,308
we're always willing to teach and we're

173
00:07:38,219 --> 00:07:42,779
it's kind of our motto alright so what I

174
00:07:41,309 --> 00:07:43,589
have this is where we get into the

175
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:45,389
hacking web line

176
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:49,199
so I've Labor's hereditary optic

177
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:52,009
neuropathy or lho in for short what does

178
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:55,139
that mean so it's a long story short

179
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:58,739
mitochondria degenerative disease for my

180
00:07:55,139 --> 00:08:00,179
right knee old ganglia cells so the

181
00:07:58,739 --> 00:08:02,039
accion's in the back of the eye so if

182
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:04,498
you've remember your cones and controls

183
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:05,489
color the axioms and everything else

184
00:08:04,499 --> 00:08:07,259
behind that

185
00:08:05,489 --> 00:08:10,229
Mayon minor deteriorated to the point

186
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:12,869
that might be no innocence the nerve

187
00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:15,269
itself the mitochondria of the cell does

188
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:16,529
not produce power off cell right if we

189
00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:18,509
remember that from biology it does not

190
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:19,979
produce enough energy to have me

191
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:21,119
precisely focus which is why I got to

192
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:25,589
make things bigger because the center of

193
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:27,089
my vision is blurry so there are

194
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:31,439
multiple different types I have mine on

195
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:33,299
the 14 484 genome so if you are any big

196
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:35,459
curious about biohacking mitochondria

197
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:36,838
things like that again this is this is

198
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:40,609
the things to look for you can look it

199
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:43,219
up there's no cure genetic

200
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:45,389
beautification it's a genetic mutation

201
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:48,360
so the only way to fix it would be

202
00:08:45,389 --> 00:08:50,430
through genetic modification or there's

203
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,470
some things there's drops where they

204
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:54,089
boost the mitochondria it gets in

205
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,980
through the cell and kind of helps it

206
00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:58,079
produce a little bit more energy but you

207
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,120
know it's a short-term temporary kind of

208
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:02,550
solution and not really considered a

209
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,569
cure and it doesn't work for extended

210
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,979
periods of time because you would have

211
00:09:03,569 --> 00:09:08,430
to keep dosing higher and higher

212
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:10,230
but anyway fun stuff there but again I

213
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,949
was diagnosed shortly after turning age

214
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,269
16

215
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:14,490
you know probably the best age you could

216
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:17,370
be diagnosed that honestly I see people

217
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:19,949
get diagnosed a little younger and that

218
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,149
they're fine their issue but as you get

219
00:09:19,949 --> 00:09:23,250
older you know if you get used to

220
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:24,720
driving doing those things it's tougher

221
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:28,920
so I've never really driven a day in my

222
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:32,220
life but you know life goes on so again

223
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:34,019
wha so you know how I do my job right so

224
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,879
I told you as a hacker's pen tester I'm

225
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:38,519
a red teamer so I use accessibility

226
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:43,100
technology mostly magnifications since I

227
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:45,269
do have the bulk of my vision here so

228
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:48,389
that means a lot of magnification

229
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:50,339
sometimes screen readers but I use it to

230
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:52,589
help show people the level of

231
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:57,509
accessibility at times including on

232
00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:59,459
streams that I do on Twitch so it's I do

233
00:09:57,509 --> 00:10:01,139
my work the same way you do it so here's

234
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:03,449
the cool thing I have a little demo

235
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:06,120
since I they gave me an hour I've little

236
00:10:03,449 --> 00:10:08,209
demo to show you guys some of the stuff

237
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,379
towards the in there so it'll show a

238
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:13,349
little bit of enumeration I'm not gonna

239
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:15,360
do any exploitation or you know but I

240
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:17,579
will do some blind analyzing blindly

241
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,139
analyze things but we want to any

242
00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:20,939
exploitation or thing like that if you

243
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:22,860
want that come to stream we'll talk

244
00:10:20,939 --> 00:10:25,670
about it but of course you know again

245
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:30,209
enumerate enumerate you know analyze

246
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:31,469
exploit uh you know and then uh for cure

247
00:10:30,209 --> 00:10:38,579
crab my funnel didn't take home the

248
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:40,980
bacon as it were so uh so how I do it so

249
00:10:38,579 --> 00:10:42,870
I love CLI tools right eat just being a

250
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:45,149
hacker being general nerd we prefer them

251
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:47,730
anyway but being visually impaired I

252
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:49,829
definitely prefer CLI tools more anyway

253
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:52,230
especially when they have an output I'm

254
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:55,019
fine with some GUI tools that actually

255
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:57,389
are through browsers using html5 stuff

256
00:10:55,019 --> 00:11:00,120
in things like Nessus are fine but a lot

257
00:10:57,389 --> 00:11:01,259
of my work and Matt Metasploit so the

258
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,939
cool thing is as I have learned

259
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:06,930
throughout the years how to grab necess

260
00:11:02,939 --> 00:11:09,000
results import them into Metasploit CLI

261
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:12,089
and then like I can output the database

262
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,639
I don't have such a complex example of

263
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:17,879
that today but we'll talk about that and

264
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:19,259
a little bit too so CLI tools are okay

265
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:21,300
but they're still tough to use things

266
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:23,370
that are even worse to use and I hate

267
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:25,620
picking on my my my pals over at

268
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:28,139
bloodhound but you know when they set up

269
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:31,139
the neo4j and using javascript a node

270
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:33,720
and just know that it is tough to see

271
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:35,250
because it's gooey there's no alt text

272
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,960
there's no sway to the screen reader can

273
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:40,110
grab and read it so

274
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:42,540
again pretty tough to use other tools

275
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:44,880
that are terrible to use montego uh the

276
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:48,000
CLI GUI based tools yeah you know I know

277
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,670
being visually you know being probably

278
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,650
less than the percentage of this

279
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:54,870
community but you know it's the more

280
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:56,220
I've been advocated for this I find out

281
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:57,690
more and more if the community is

282
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:00,840
worried about site loss as they get

283
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:03,090
older color loss macular degeneration oh

284
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:05,820
well I guess I won't be hacker after I

285
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:06,750
get my macular my MD in place and you're

286
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,550
like well why not

287
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:10,170
I got la Xuan which is kind of the

288
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:11,280
opposite of that macular degeneration is

289
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:12,170
from the outside in mine's from the

290
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:15,000
inside out

291
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:16,860
I'll see why you can't hack anymore I I

292
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,460
literally do it every day for the last

293
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:22,080
15 years as a job so you know things

294
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,700
like that but yeah those tools on the

295
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,890
bottom harder to use tools at the top

296
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:28,410
easier to use a lot of people get a

297
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:30,240
little spaced out when we starts talking

298
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:32,069
about some of the tools that they'll

299
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,890
have to use right it just sounds hard

300
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:38,670
difficult well it is and again I'll show

301
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:40,140
you more during the example here in a

302
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:45,150
little bit how to fix things how to tune

303
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:47,100
things things like that so uh this this

304
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:49,800
slide here it means a lot to me again

305
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,940
being a advocate for accessibility how

306
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,609
to approach people with a visual

307
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:55,170
disability again we're like very slowly

308
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:57,510
and cautiously because most of us are

309
00:12:55,170 --> 00:13:00,660
like rabid animals of course that's

310
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:01,950
sarcasm work for humans to do you know

311
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,480
you don't have to like make some noise

312
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:05,280
tap your foot as you're walking up to

313
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,850
someone with a disability so they know

314
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,270
where you're at

315
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:10,440
they can hear you trust me maybe not all

316
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:12,569
the time if they have headphones in

317
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,070
there so for circumstances permitting

318
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:17,520
most of the time thinking you're you

319
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:19,790
approaching you know if there's but you

320
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,600
know if this is a situation where you're

321
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:23,819
working with them studying with them

322
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,530
just approach you being introduce

323
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,910
yourself know if they probably won't

324
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:28,290
remember your voice stuff or a few times

325
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:31,439
unless you have a very unique or

326
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:33,120
distinct voice sorry it's just like

327
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,920
people with faces yeah you can remember

328
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,660
a face you see people at cons you go

329
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,400
yeah I hear people I hear people are

330
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,630
constantly oh that's this person because

331
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,120
they have a very unique voice other

332
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:44,070
times like I think I recognize that let

333
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,650
me investigate further things like that

334
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:49,740
but just approach people just like you

335
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:50,819
would normally you know and if you ever

336
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,350
see them needing

337
00:13:50,819 --> 00:13:55,738
help or anything just ask if they need

338
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:58,319
help or even want help first don't don't

339
00:13:55,739 --> 00:14:01,049
assume that their loss or don't know

340
00:13:58,319 --> 00:14:02,699
what they're doing but you know again

341
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:05,399
treating them like a normal human being

342
00:14:02,699 --> 00:14:08,998
really um let's see

343
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:11,999
now as each person is different so our

344
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:14,039
peoples visually impaired in a so our

345
00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:16,229
people's visual impairments but also the

346
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:18,119
visually impaired persons comfort levels

347
00:14:16,229 --> 00:14:20,549
is it is this a new place for them

348
00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:22,139
example I was coming to Indianapolis for

349
00:14:20,549 --> 00:14:24,029
Ridgely originally coming to

350
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:27,089
Indianapolis for the first time to

351
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:29,189
Circle City con so I'm googling routes

352
00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:31,619
on googling things nearby I'm looking at

353
00:14:29,189 --> 00:14:33,299
the map I'm listening to the

354
00:14:31,619 --> 00:14:34,829
instructions on how to get around things

355
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:36,720
like that so I have the ability to

356
00:14:34,829 --> 00:14:39,209
travel because I've traveled a lot for

357
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,600
my job so I understand that now if this

358
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:44,248
is a person who is traveling for the

359
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,949
first time going to university going to

360
00:14:44,249 --> 00:14:51,509
learn coming to a conference they may

361
00:14:46,949 --> 00:14:53,099
not get that right and you know a while

362
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:54,720
remaining very much independent as a

363
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,549
visually impaired person sometimes they

364
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,919
do require hope so again you approach

365
00:14:56,549 --> 00:15:02,879
you ask you inquire you make sure that

366
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:05,279
those things make sense to them and

367
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:06,779
again recognize frustration versus

368
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,569
misunderstanding I know I skipped one

369
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:11,100
aligned with their personality style so

370
00:15:09,569 --> 00:15:13,019
you can align with personas and style

371
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:15,479
you know hey if you see them doing these

372
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:17,699
things if you're if you're in the pervy

373
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:19,259
food there and food you know work you

374
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:21,209
know now with them again we're just

375
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:23,159
normal people but again so back to

376
00:15:21,209 --> 00:15:24,959
recognize frustration versus

377
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:27,089
misunderstanding that's something I run

378
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,118
into a lot when I get frustrated with

379
00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:32,309
sometimes sometimes people think I'm

380
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:34,409
misunderstanding and it might just be a

381
00:15:32,309 --> 00:15:38,159
frustration with the technology or the

382
00:15:34,409 --> 00:15:41,189
tool oh this this visiting to this tool

383
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:43,079
or using my phone to listen to a text

384
00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:45,089
message and you're using a lot of short

385
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:47,399
speak and the phone doesn't know how to

386
00:15:45,089 --> 00:15:49,729
translate it and I misunderstand

387
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:52,139
something it's different than you know

388
00:15:49,729 --> 00:15:54,179
understanding it or like dealing what

389
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:55,799
what and you know if I you know you know

390
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:57,809
in a conversation if I reply what maybe

391
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:59,579
look at what you said especially if you

392
00:15:57,809 --> 00:16:02,999
tried to make it clear maybe using so

393
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:04,620
many acronyms but you know I know how to

394
00:16:02,999 --> 00:16:07,530
advocate for it a little better

395
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:12,390
so just do things like that and that's

396
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:14,850
an example of that sometimes when I'm

397
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:17,370
out in public people just like you know

398
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:20,700
a blind or hey Joe and if you're across

399
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:23,760
the room from me and you just say hey

400
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:25,620
hey and you expect me to because I do

401
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,000
seem very excited very normal at times

402
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,990
especially during conversations people

403
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,150
forgetting half the time I'm visually

404
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:32,190
impaired they go to show me something on

405
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:33,990
their phone like I'm gonna need to you

406
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:35,310
know zoom in or manipulate it or if it's

407
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:37,140
big enough that I can see it but you

408
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:38,760
know if you see me looking or if you

409
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:40,199
call me or someone with a visual

410
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,870
impairment you know keep giving them

411
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:46,710
indicators of where you are big waves

412
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:49,680
you know double handed waves or just

413
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:51,810
come and get me or come get the vision

414
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,959
impaired person so that's huge things

415
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:56,819
that really will help bring them and

416
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,800
include them in more things instead of

417
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:01,020
just calling them or or not calling them

418
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,400
if he's if they're in the community you

419
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,379
know and they want to be part of it and

420
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:09,210
you know them bringing them over and

421
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:10,680
being inclusive Frank let's see this is

422
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:12,720
a big thing I've been asked how do I

423
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:15,270
learn with someone with like low vision

424
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,040
or blind disability because I've had my

425
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:18,869
friends go like I want to study with you

426
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,790
but how do we do it again just like an

427
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:23,219
old human being I mean let's you know my

428
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:27,869
brain works as well I just don't see as

429
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:29,550
well right so you know it's a lot of

430
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:32,429
it's one of those things that when I get

431
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:34,260
to the point that I'm trying to learn

432
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:36,090
with people and dig into those benefits

433
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,710
of how to one of people but being a

434
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:39,240
teacher I've learned I can teach people

435
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:42,270
to learn with me so if it's a new

436
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,620
concept for both of us and when it's the

437
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,720
point that maybe again I have that

438
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:48,149
frustration versus misunderstanding or I

439
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,650
don't know what's going up I ask I've

440
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,420
talked about this on several of the

441
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:52,770
podcasts I've been on as frumpty

442
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,840
actually sometimes I just don't

443
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:56,160
understand things so specifically when

444
00:17:54,840 --> 00:18:00,000
it comes to web stuff because sometimes

445
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,490
I don't see the impact right like a

446
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,690
cross-site scripting Puffs

447
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:05,220
something up well if I don't see the

448
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:06,300
thing and I'm like ah it's not working

449
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,580
that's that's different than

450
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:10,620
misunderstanding so being able to

451
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:12,960
understand those concepts and explain

452
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:14,850
them to people who might be new to the

453
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,830
industry is something I've tried to

454
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:18,178
explain to them and and I've had

455
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:20,158
reasonable level of exists

456
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:22,470
success but when you're learning with

457
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:25,019
somebody for the first time you might

458
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:27,179
have one of these you know official

459
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:28,860
issue explain to them well okay so

460
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:31,019
you've got a map you know close your

461
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:33,178
eyes imagine a square but you know we

462
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:34,830
know to squares put the text in there

463
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:36,509
you know it reads it from left to right

464
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:38,399
we understand that concept go all right

465
00:18:36,509 --> 00:18:40,529
now there's a box that pops up being

466
00:18:38,399 --> 00:18:42,268
able to say and they go oh okay I see

467
00:18:40,529 --> 00:18:44,460
there's so okay if I'm gonna there's a

468
00:18:42,269 --> 00:18:46,700
box so some people even when they're

469
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:49,559
blind of our visual some people are not

470
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:51,899
you explaining the concept

471
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:53,700
wholeheartedly to the point where you

472
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:55,729
know okay now imagine more code says

473
00:18:53,700 --> 00:19:00,389
this you might have to get to that level

474
00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:01,590
but you know again so when they get

475
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:04,769
frustrated you still want to encourage

476
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:05,908
the them so it occurs in the same way

477
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:06,990
you do everybody else you know don't

478
00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:08,909
over encourage so much just because

479
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:12,629
they're officially created but we can

480
00:19:08,909 --> 00:19:14,159
still detect sarcasm teach with the

481
00:19:12,629 --> 00:19:15,779
right examples again it's hard to

482
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:19,529
sometimes teach somebody with imagery

483
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:21,299
now if you can explain to them again in

484
00:19:19,529 --> 00:19:24,059
a way that they understand great but you

485
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:27,418
know that's working with someone who's

486
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:29,070
visually impaired and kind of going hand

487
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:31,110
in hand with them as you go through this

488
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:33,178
to show them this was the you know oath

489
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:35,189
so you're you're Vivian you are so

490
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:36,659
there's the there's no terms for it

491
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:38,429
unfortunately but if you say someone

492
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:39,899
incident it meaning they can see the

493
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:42,570
imagery they can do those things great

494
00:19:39,899 --> 00:19:44,549
but if they can't you can see it's

495
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:46,139
trying to help them tell ask them how

496
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:49,320
they might imagine it looks and then see

497
00:19:46,139 --> 00:19:51,508
if you can use their imagery to explain

498
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:54,389
it to them right it's pretty pretty good

499
00:19:51,509 --> 00:19:56,519
method there you know one of the things

500
00:19:54,389 --> 00:20:00,928
that I've also had to deal with in my

501
00:19:56,519 --> 00:20:03,929
life is when oh well you know you didn't

502
00:20:00,929 --> 00:20:06,629
ask for more time you know so having

503
00:20:03,929 --> 00:20:09,169
trouble doing something on an exam in

504
00:20:06,629 --> 00:20:12,509
high school or some of my post teaching

505
00:20:09,169 --> 00:20:14,700
post education and I didn't ask for more

506
00:20:12,509 --> 00:20:18,360
time well now I've got I gotta remember

507
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:20,639
hey if this is a 4 hour exam and it's a

508
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,979
lot of reading I might have to ask for

509
00:20:20,639 --> 00:20:24,418
more time I'm gonna ask teacher and but

510
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:26,460
you know I'm gonna come to you again me

511
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:29,399
I'm experienced Macomb you but I'm gonna

512
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:30,690
need six hours you know or you know I'm

513
00:20:29,399 --> 00:20:31,379
gonna need a little bit of your time and

514
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:32,520
most

515
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:35,220
the time they'll work with the other

516
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:36,389
living alright I get it but you know

517
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:38,400
again anybody with a learning disability

518
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:40,980
who advocates rooms they'll stay front

519
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:44,370
into those things too but you know when

520
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:46,620
when learning or teaching someone

521
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:49,409
provide that extra time if possible um

522
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:51,330
and as always I love to I love to kind

523
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:52,890
of circle back to the to the message of

524
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:56,060
things I've done that several times now

525
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:58,530
just to reinforce things but recap

526
00:20:56,060 --> 00:21:00,810
recapping things just go to kind of go

527
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:01,860
over it just to make sure that everybody

528
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:04,649
helps by the way this helps for

529
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:06,899
everybody but just again going over it

530
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:08,970
with the imagery or the vividness that

531
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,500
you know the fish'll impaired person can

532
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:11,700
understand it's an important thing just

533
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:14,250
so make sure they understand the cons

534
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,600
have them explain it to you see if you

535
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:18,510
can close your eyes or illegal boat

536
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,850
whatever and see if you can get that

537
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:23,010
feeling and make sure that it feels

538
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:25,169
right make sure that their imagery in

539
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:28,110
their head or their vividness and their

540
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:32,430
head matches the actual way that it

541
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:34,590
works in a visual world and then of

542
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:35,850
course and if one of the best things you

543
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:38,429
could do is if you're doing a study

544
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:40,830
session or note-taking or trading notes

545
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:43,140
or studying you know share your nose

546
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:44,879
with them you know your the way people

547
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:48,690
take notes is very differently depending

548
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,340
on how things work but that's as an

549
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:52,740
individual thing but you know maybe you

550
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:55,260
guys have similar enough you know

551
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:56,550
learning methodology sets up they'll

552
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,870
they'll help out and I'm not saying give

553
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:59,220
them your notes like oh they need to

554
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:01,350
come to class give them your notes know

555
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:02,880
if they maybe if they're like oh my

556
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:05,459
notes the kind of you know because we're

557
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,680
going to spend more time typing that

558
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:09,270
than being able to you know visually

559
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:12,480
intake things so we're like all right so

560
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:14,879
it's gonna probably be this this so just

561
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,380
if you can and it helps them of course

562
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,300
you know they're your student peer

563
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:22,500
things like that work with them of

564
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:27,090
course as always be inclusive when in

565
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:29,100
this case being inclusive and it's hard

566
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:31,800
to explain us so the world is definitely

567
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:34,260
not designed to include the blind or low

568
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:36,780
vision a lot of people go what do you

569
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:38,370
mean we've got these sidewalks that beep

570
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:40,740
and you can cross have you ever actually

571
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:42,479
tried to sit there close your eyes at a

572
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,560
very busy intersection go to a major

573
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,120
city close your eyes

574
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,710
I didn't tell which sign is

575
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,409
beeping is that across the street is

576
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:53,280
that next to me is that here is it going

577
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:56,160
this way or is it going that way it can

578
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,990
be extraordinarily difficult even for

579
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:59,970
the visually impaired who you know have

580
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:01,680
trained themselves to go you know listen

581
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:05,250
for things is it back in front you know

582
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:07,110
hold references so when I say be

583
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:09,570
inclusive and and the world's not

584
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:10,949
designed also places like Amazon I you

585
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:13,110
know throw throw the biggest retail

586
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:18,210
under the bus go to Amazon and go look

587
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:18,629
at clothing type in green sweater as an

588
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:20,850
example

589
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:24,530
scroll through keep scrolling so you go

590
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:26,760
oh well that's hunters not green anymore

591
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:28,620
yep the description says it's green

592
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:31,410
things like that you know it's hard to

593
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:33,419
go shopping it's hard to find food do I

594
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:35,760
go you know do I go to Amazon and if I

595
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:38,160
type in and chicken soup well I really

596
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,950
like Campbell's unless it specifically

597
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:42,330
says Campbell's chicken suit oh no you

598
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:44,820
bought the wrong chicken soup it's this

599
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:48,629
well chicken soup is chicken soup don't

600
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:51,240
don't don't don't add me on Twitter but

601
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:54,990
the you know ultimately just try to find

602
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:56,220
ways to they can be inclusive to bring

603
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:58,280
them in and expand you know again just

604
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:00,240
find them bring them in your friends

605
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:03,178
because remember the world is not

606
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,070
entirely meant for us and of course to

607
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:10,710
the blind low vision or visually

608
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:19,260
impaired folks you know ask for what you

609
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:23,130
need I see that a lot I see that a lot

610
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:28,879
sorry I see that all visually impaired

611
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:31,590
folks go I need X but they asked for it

612
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:35,190
no you got to be vocal you have to

613
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:38,040
advocate for so I learned it because

614
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:38,880
when I was 16 people thought I was

615
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,559
making it up

616
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:46,410
rapid vision loss that doesn't happen

617
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:48,389
and you're right it is very rare I lost

618
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:50,820
it almost overnight in a period of

619
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:53,100
from-from a few days after my 16th

620
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:54,480
birthday so essentially it started

621
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:57,750
probably the third day after my birthday

622
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,770
I was almost entirely blind by the sixth

623
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:01,380
day three day

624
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:04,800
my vision drops so rapidly I went from

625
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:08,460
being able to read the exam I was taking

626
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:10,200
kazoos near midterms in high school so I

627
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:11,400
went from being able to take care of pop

628
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:15,120
quizzes something I remember just being

629
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:16,920
trying to read and going you know I'm

630
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,600
focusing and things are changing and we

631
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:22,830
had no clue my family was affected by

632
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:25,379
this so or that I would be affected by

633
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:26,879
this period much less money you know now

634
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:28,590
going through the years from some of my

635
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,929
additional family members um

636
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:33,780
no clue I was the first one it drops so

637
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:36,390
rapidly and I didn't know what to do so

638
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:38,550
you have to advocate versus lephant I

639
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:40,920
learned because my teachers teachers do

640
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:43,350
care but some of them I was a problem

641
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:46,410
student I won't deny that so I went from

642
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:48,449
problem student to problem addicts do

643
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:50,760
tonight also now I have to have things

644
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:52,679
blowing up or read to me they're like oh

645
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,450
you're thinking that you're trying to

646
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:58,740
get more time because you're just lazy

647
00:25:54,450 --> 00:26:01,200
and well no that wasn't the case but

648
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:02,730
again you have to advocate for your

649
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,010
knees I had to learn how to do it very

650
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:06,809
quickly because I knew being a

651
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:12,059
problematic student people weren't going

652
00:26:06,809 --> 00:26:16,139
to help me out anyway so work loads ways

653
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:17,280
to help I got this gold ah--this I

654
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:19,920
believe is how you say his name Zach

655
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:23,700
he's another stream or another InfoSec

656
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:26,010
Twitter person all over the place he was

657
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:30,360
I posted something on Twitter about

658
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:34,740
having issues with a large online

659
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:37,439
security vendor education vendor there

660
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:39,929
pay board some of their courses came

661
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,030
down an HTML PDF next great sometimes

662
00:26:39,929 --> 00:26:44,250
PDFs are fine but when I go to translate

663
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:46,740
them using the OCR so it reads it out to

664
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:49,020
me or reorganizes it so I get better

665
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,250
font than what people say for PDFs and

666
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:52,410
because they want to save that extra

667
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:54,960
megabyte so they compress it a little

668
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:56,300
bit and it gets blurry and blurry things

669
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,559
aren't great for the visually impaired

670
00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:00,240
so when I go through that I was like I

671
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,500
just kept having problems and it was

672
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,480
trying to read things and I was trying

673
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,800
to understand what was going on so I'm

674
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,390
zooming in finally and I get the

675
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,850
constant but I wanted to post about it

676
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:10,740
when I was asked oh by the way when I

677
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:11,649
write a blog how do I help or when I

678
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:13,240
write a program

679
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:16,090
how do I help when I was like that's a

680
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:18,640
great question well first thing you can

681
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:19,780
do is keep asking that question asking

682
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,250
that question the first thing it's a

683
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:24,700
great way to help I should probably put

684
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:27,100
that as bullet point number one but what

685
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:29,110
I tell my fellow might--might developer

686
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:34,110
friends my hacker friends and creators

687
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:36,370
of scripts programs if you make them

688
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:39,669
document your word the first thing you

689
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:41,949
do is document your leaving comments in

690
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:44,230
there where I can change things work and

691
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:47,940
modify thinks if there's output how do i

692
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:51,460
do output really help file a man file

693
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:52,530
document your word that doesn't happen

694
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:55,420
often

695
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:58,300
sometimes I go beat on somebody's door

696
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:59,500
and then they go oh you're right let me

697
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:02,129
talk to me a little bit more like I

698
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:05,020
meant to do that and we like Kenya

699
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:07,660
people to it and it's fortunate again

700
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:09,580
because I'm loud

701
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:10,930
you know of people follow me on Twitter

702
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:12,790
you know whatever case may be and people

703
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:14,410
go you know let me do that for you and

704
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:16,180
that's doing it for me you're doing it

705
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:17,830
for the community at large because some

706
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:20,410
people just like to read things or

707
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:22,629
listen to things whatever so document

708
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:24,310
your work comments documentation

709
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:27,280
whatever you can do I don't you know

710
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:29,679
lurk if you have trouble with it come to

711
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:31,510
me we can work on it together I've I've

712
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:33,160
read so many courses and read so many

713
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:34,900
things and written so many things that I

714
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:38,080
will help you document your work in a

715
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:38,890
way that is the way to explain it moving

716
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,730
on

717
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:45,310
keep it simple as well when doing

718
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:47,140
formatting when doing things in math was

719
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:49,540
the craziest thing for me to learn when

720
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:53,470
I was a teenager because hey the only

721
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:56,170
place to do it was on their their

722
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:57,820
website and it was like every other page

723
00:28:56,170 --> 00:29:02,290
I was like reading a Wikipedia article

724
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:04,810
every time what is - oh do boom where do

725
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:06,580
I put it - oh and you know eventually

726
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:09,129
you figured off you do it anyway but

727
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:11,470
there's there's these nuances so that's

728
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:15,100
why do the quick sheets show people how

729
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:18,220
to run it keep it simple go from there

730
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:21,760
right use simple verbage as well don't

731
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:24,230
spell out really kind of big words just

732
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:27,590
use standard verbage wreak on tool

733
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:30,350
did it steps go more allow for output to

734
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:33,889
be a grep Apple searchable or any file

735
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:37,520
front of friendly file formats if you

736
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:42,950
use XML and data trees for parsing

737
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:44,090
awesome write it up parser or document

738
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:47,419
how to write a parser tell me what your

739
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:50,540
Dave trees look like um there's uh just

740
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:52,250
take you to check in my time make a

741
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:54,799
parser if you don't know how to make a

742
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:58,130
parser it's fine work with somebody who

743
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:58,940
does come to me I'm not great at it I

744
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:01,760
can help

745
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:04,160
um I don't use everybody's tools because

746
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,510
of those kind of things that I can't get

747
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:08,330
excellent if I can't get grab below if I

748
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:10,010
can't get XML you don't have parser I

749
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:11,600
can't use your tool by the way I

750
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:12,860
advocate for more vision impaired and

751
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,659
blind people to get on our industry

752
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:16,490
because we can work from home we can

753
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:19,100
work remote and people will work around

754
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:21,260
our skip visuals because of the things

755
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:24,469
we do well as more people join industry

756
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:29,179
or as you know us folks get older you

757
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:30,919
know you know gray beards now that man I

758
00:30:29,179 --> 00:30:32,690
gotta blow up my screen and do this and

759
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:34,700
everybody comes to me no I can barely

760
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:36,830
see my screen I'm like get a 4k screen

761
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,450
put it on 120 percent if you get a zoom

762
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:41,330
and do these things get high DPI

763
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:43,610
explaining all stuff but a bottom line I

764
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:46,220
still would like to see parsers in a way

765
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:47,809
that organizes the data neatly in a

766
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:50,900
comma separated value see it at speed

767
00:30:47,809 --> 00:30:52,280
again not hard and it's not your job

768
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:54,290
always to do it but if you can at least

769
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:56,690
put it out there to be done let's do it

770
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:59,210
let's work together too much data has

771
00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:00,350
never been a problem except for and this

772
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:01,940
is where we'll go over the example

773
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,209
unless it's screeching across your

774
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:04,730
screen

775
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:07,179
well again I have time for a tech demo I

776
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:12,650
will show it to you guys it can be

777
00:31:07,179 --> 00:31:14,540
burdensome and it can be very uh and it

778
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:17,299
there's it's always a pain when you miss

779
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:22,159
things so try to tag valuable data in

780
00:31:17,299 --> 00:31:25,190
your tool and what I mean by that is in

781
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:28,220
map fortunate says vulnerable so if I go

782
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:30,260
is SN be vulnerable okay grab through

783
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:32,090
the document for the words fall SMB

784
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:34,429
vulnerable you know try to put

785
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:35,629
characters together use cut documents I

786
00:31:34,429 --> 00:31:36,530
don't have all the scripts to do all

787
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:39,410
that published

788
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:42,110
got things that I do but if you can try

789
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:44,060
to put together so so again it can be

790
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:45,409
possible and read to find the important

791
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,909
things or highlight the important things

792
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:50,450
and by highlighting I don't just mean

793
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:54,200
with colors visually uh you know try to

794
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:56,510
uh you know make it make some kind of

795
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:58,850
non visually friendly like you know

796
00:31:56,510 --> 00:32:00,620
imported tag lo tag you know something

797
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:02,780
exclamation four exclamation points in a

798
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:06,770
row tell me somewhere document and I'll

799
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:09,080
find it and hues in it critical thinking

800
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:11,210
is best when it comes to accessibility

801
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:13,939
what does that mean sit down and think

802
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:16,010
can somebody see this can somebody do

803
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:17,720
this what does it look like how is it

804
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:18,980
going to just be if you're trying to be

805
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:22,160
inclusive and you're trying to be an

806
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:23,420
ally for the accessibility that's what

807
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:26,810
you're gonna have to do a little bit of

808
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:28,490
critical thing be inclusive be

809
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:31,940
descriptive and keep it simple

810
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:35,740
that's the wrap up for this slide all

811
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:38,060
right so that develop to be inclusive

812
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:39,080
kind of goes back to what we're just

813
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:41,840
talking about there but if you're gonna

814
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:44,300
develop tools or training material or

815
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,040
anything if you're a creator and you're

816
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:49,010
developing thing about occlusive think

817
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:51,740
if someone is always zoomed in mic they

818
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:53,330
miss flashing things off I'm gonna put a

819
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:55,250
alert in the upper right corner so it

820
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:56,270
doesn't disturb anybody you know how

821
00:32:55,250 --> 00:33:00,740
often I go to the upper right corner

822
00:32:56,270 --> 00:33:03,500
when I go to close apps so try to think

823
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:06,050
way if somebody zoomed in things use

824
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:10,310
audible tones oh try to use different

825
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:13,550
audible tones Bing Bing Bing 50 things

826
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:17,210
eventually like discord noises I tuned

827
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:18,919
them out whoop-whoop all day is like

828
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:20,840
wear headphones all day cuz I'm

829
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,460
listening for things eventually I

830
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,870
started oh I'm chatting everybody having

831
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:25,370
a good time and then some you know

832
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:27,800
squirrel I get distracted

833
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:29,750
Bing Bing I'm not paying attention but

834
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:33,379
now somebody direct messages me I would

835
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:35,750
love to know I'm just having a little

836
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:36,950
fun but things like that you know think

837
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:39,170
if someone's looking at this all day

838
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:41,960
waterways I can help I would I actually

839
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:44,450
was at a operation sinner early on in my

840
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:49,030
career and found out four different

841
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:49,030
alerts we could also play a tone

842
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:55,110
on my box yes what every tone or every

843
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:57,450
Lert had a different tone I went online

844
00:33:55,110 --> 00:34:00,689
I found the soundboard cheese when

845
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:02,700
things started happening on my system at

846
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:04,710
the Operations Center you knew and it's

847
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:06,840
funny because the other guys knew and

848
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:09,150
that was kind of the point oh dating oh

849
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:12,060
all right an info came up don't worry

850
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:13,590
about it weren't weren't whoa whoa okay

851
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:16,049
let me look into that too

852
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:17,070
oh that's critical oh okay you know

853
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:20,040
those things like that

854
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:22,230
again I'll put two logs text files

855
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:24,150
always great if you can if you even if

856
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:25,380
you don't write outputs and allow for

857
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:27,330
grep Abul and you don't have time for

858
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:29,400
that if you just some kind of log

859
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:31,560
somewhere or output to the screen or put

860
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:34,610
data in Linux in Windows you can always

861
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:38,070
find a way to pipe it into an output

862
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:39,840
when blogging this was the question that

863
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:42,390
we got into wind blocking try to use

864
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:45,090
markdown I love markdown I use markdown

865
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:47,040
right so I take notes now in markdown I

866
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:50,330
hate reading remark down I love the

867
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:53,279
display ethic because the way a

868
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:56,159
Microsoft Reader and other tools read it

869
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,630
natural reader for for browsers just to

870
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,279
hit read on a page and they go do

871
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:04,560
something else while it isn't a big

872
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:06,060
media blog post things like that it kind

873
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,830
of pronounces things and sometimes

874
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:11,759
differently when bold it's a nice eye

875
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:13,560
you know so again use markdown it's very

876
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,910
helpful medium is a great platform even

877
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:19,320
though it's not marked down it reads

878
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:21,120
those things fine so WordPress 50/50

879
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:23,070
there's a lot of accessibility plugins

880
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,900
now you can use them make sure they stay

881
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:26,850
up today things like that

882
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:32,670
if you have a GUI if you write a GUI

883
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:34,860
awesome include a CLI please and let's

884
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:37,830
see one of the things that I've seen

885
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:40,370
recently is this trend of like leaky

886
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:44,100
ASCII text or spray art ASCII text

887
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:46,020
really cool except for when your screen

888
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:48,870
reader is attempting to read from left

889
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:52,050
to right and it reads each one of those

890
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:54,120
characters so like Twitter is insane the

891
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:55,920
emojis like some of those people use

892
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,970
like emojis to point at stuff and

893
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,030
there's a bunch of hands in there so

894
00:35:56,970 --> 00:36:01,350
we're in the middle if

895
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:02,370
I'm using a screen reader on my phone

896
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:04,140
just to keep reading through Twitter

897
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:07,650
that's the things Pablo I have to

898
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:09,600
disable it because it reads each one by

899
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:12,930
the way for all the alt text if you're

900
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:14,730
using a you know hand pointing down hand

901
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:17,490
20 left hand pointing down hand 20 you

902
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:20,730
know it'll read each one of those so

903
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:23,100
just keep that in mind with building

904
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:26,370
tools try to cut some of that out so

905
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:27,810
again my workflows with tools that do

906
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:30,810
drop lots of data things like in that

907
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:33,750
options IP output file or just pipe it

908
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:37,590
output you know types of grep out the

909
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:38,760
bash output to a in map that log then I

910
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:40,910
can read through it later

911
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:43,650
you know I control Z being gfg

912
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:45,299
background things foreground snow huh so

913
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:51,870
it's no interaction once it's completed

914
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:56,940
I can access my output again in my in my

915
00:36:51,870 --> 00:37:01,109
usage of tools use a lot of SSH

916
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:07,140
PowerShell see alive bash

917
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:09,870
I forgot bash things like that so cool

918
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:12,089
thing like using terminator and Kali I

919
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:14,490
can alt two different windows and it

920
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:16,110
just reads just those windows so as I

921
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:19,620
complete things you can also run you can

922
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:22,800
tab around in Windows in power shuttle

923
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:24,359
CLI or outputs you know any kind of a

924
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,220
classic example I want to kind of talk

925
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:28,950
about here is a forensics tool I got

926
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:30,839
asked recently a student who was totally

927
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:33,000
blind I was taking a forensics course at

928
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:36,690
a university and the teacher wouldn't

929
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,680
modify the lesson first of all don't get

930
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:39,660
me started on that

931
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,220
if you can't modify your lesson because

932
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:43,290
you're not used to other tools yep

933
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:47,669
probably not as good at the industry as

934
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:49,620
you think you are but if your coursework

935
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:56,160
in your class you can modify it for this

936
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:58,200
day or help out um if you can modify it

937
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:01,410
for the student help out that's great so

938
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:05,520
but make sure that your output in it you

939
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:09,600
can teach with any number of tools let's

940
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:11,100
see I know questions or anything since

941
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,790
we're online unless somebody wants to

942
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:16,000
read all questions or I can go

943
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:17,529
come up I'll do it afterwards I slept it

944
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,530
in there but here's where you can act

945
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:23,800
you can get a hold of me but since now I

946
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:27,760
have we'll call it I'll give myself a

947
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:30,700
few more minutes of time so what I

948
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:33,670
wanted to show you guys and I got all

949
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:36,069
this preset up as best I could

950
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:37,900
so I'm going to show you guys what it's

951
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:42,250
like to listen to end map on very very

952
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:47,280
verbose with a screen reader losing its

953
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:51,670
bananas I'm gonna pull up PowerShell I

954
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:54,160
am going to run in map Ashe V V so very

955
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:54,790
verbose not very very verbose so just be

956
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:59,710
happy about that

957
00:38:54,790 --> 00:39:01,720
- SS smallest biggest so since can dash

958
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:04,600
SV so we're gonna attempt to find

959
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,830
version - a so it pulls it yeah I know

960
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:08,710
what kind of you ever done it but I like

961
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:11,740
it's for me that's a so I'm gonna pull

962
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:14,440
out I want to see outputs for the

963
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:16,450
operating systems the runs some of the

964
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:18,730
simple scripts run seethe to see if

965
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:20,680
things are vulnerable I'm gonna do it on

966
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:22,210
a t4 so it's a little bit aggressive you

967
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:24,700
can tune that a little bit less

968
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:27,670
aggressive to the paranoid I'm going to

969
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:30,700
do scan me in depth org and I'm gonna do

970
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:32,110
- Oh a scan me so it's gonna output

971
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:36,160
there so let me turn on the screen

972
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:37,990
reader and bear with me apologies first

973
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:41,890
of all hopefully everybody can hear it

974
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:44,830
if my uh my operator my your help can

975
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:46,120
make sure that it's coming starting

976
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:50,279
narrator meeting controls window so

00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:16,080
at sitting near you go if you just heard

1021
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:17,460
all that and it made sense to you if it

1022
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:20,160
came through I'm hoping it came through

1023
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:22,170
I did I believe I've shared my desktop

1024
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,819
audio it's checked alright so you guys

1025
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:26,220
should have heard that so you didn't

1026
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:29,400
even hear the SSL certificate it picked

1027
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:30,870
up from the HTTP on port 80 don't even

1028
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,920
know if you heard it read out port 80 I

1029
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:34,830
don't know if you heard a read out port

1030
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:40,800
25 I believe there was a something else

1031
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:43,529
in the 9,000 31,000 so you didn't even

1032
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:45,870
get the service value so now a match

1033
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:47,940
listen F for the very first time you're

1034
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:51,180
visually impaired though your teachers

1035
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:55,830
like oh just in that this IP address and

1036
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:57,480
then you hear this so let's do the same

1037
00:41:55,830 --> 00:42:00,660
thing with just oh I had a turn

1038
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:02,520
screenreader off but so so again I'm

1039
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:04,290
trying to show you guys like so by the

1040
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,910
way and map already completed scanning

1041
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:08,340
but the screenreader was still just

1042
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:11,160
going line by line by line by line now

1043
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:18,540
you add tools that add ASCII art and

1044
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:20,819
things like that and they they do things

1045
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:22,410
like that and you go oh my god how can

1046
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:27,090
you even listen to that and

1047
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:30,359
unfortunately I have to live you know I

1048
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:32,370
don't have to but I do and I've got

1049
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:34,470
issues so prepping for things so I'll

1050
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:38,520
putting that to a file and being able to

1051
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:39,310
I didn't specifically do that cuz using

1052
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:42,280
windows

1053
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:46,029
but if I put that to file and I go you

1054
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:47,530
know grep you know 80 enter and it's

1055
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:50,320
gonna then it's literally gonna read off

1056
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:51,160
anything with you know port 80 on there

1057
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,980
so port 80

1058
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:59,859
let's see it will read this section so

1059
00:42:53,980 --> 00:43:00,820
to be a eighty TCP a little slow down so

1060
00:42:59,859 --> 00:43:09,369
it'll be ready

1061
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:12,609
TCP open HTTP sénèque TTL fifty-five

1062
00:43:09,369 --> 00:43:14,700
Apache HTTP HTTP D two point four point

1063
00:43:12,609 --> 00:43:17,799
seven I can't read a dispenser to this

1064
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:20,649
Ubuntu then it'll get into HTTP say

1065
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:22,930
Michael unknown say Biko so on then it

1066
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:26,230
will actually read by the way the md5

1067
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:28,060
sum of the fav ICO one five five so

1068
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:28,240
again if you're gonna nothing wrong in

1069
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:30,609
that

1070
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,779
I I enjoy it I appreciate everything it

1071
00:43:30,609 --> 00:43:33,819
does I get it

1072
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:37,660
but again imagine being brand new in and

1073
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:39,700
hearing that for the first time there's

1074
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:42,339
no way right you're gonna be you're

1075
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:46,598
gonna give up you're gonna go do

1076
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:49,390
anything but that um and then keep in

1077
00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:51,599
mind it keeps reading HTTP fav ICO HTTP

1078
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:56,348
methods available since we did all all

1079
00:43:51,599 --> 00:44:05,260
services HTTP server header things like

1080
00:43:56,349 --> 00:44:06,160
that so so it's gonna read all that

1081
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:10,300
stuff out guys

1082
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:11,710
so like I said if you can build your

1083
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:15,010
tools to help with that Ness

1084
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:16,480
appreciative I kind of finished up let's

1085
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:18,460
talk a little bit earlier than I thought

1086
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,839
start a little bit late but so usually

1087
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:24,780
again I give myself ten minutes for

1088
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:27,640
questions I guess I can head to a

1089
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:34,089
discord and peek out discord if I see

1090
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:35,740
any questions there I look like I have a

1091
00:44:34,089 --> 00:44:41,609
ton or I've been tagged in a ton of

1092
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:44,950
things dead pics on my house yeah I

1093
00:44:41,609 --> 00:44:47,230
could only imagine rewiring the way you

1094
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:50,230
think as a programmer after the loss of

1095
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:52,690
your site I tell you what it you know I

1096
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:55,390
was getting into computers

1097
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:57,040
I was again I'm 16 I'm a nerd that's

1098
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:58,868
when we all kind of got really curious I

1099
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:01,359
was doing bad stuff I was doing good

1100
00:44:58,869 --> 00:45:02,920
stuff I was l'm hacker da de are the

1101
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:05,170
specific reason I took chairman through

1102
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:08,230
high school I was trying to learn off

1103
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:10,240
all this stuff I took programming I took

1104
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:11,560
programming for you know for years

1105
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,419
throughout high school with the things

1106
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:14,920
that I knew I wanted to do computers and

1107
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:21,550
I knew these things I wanted to do these

1108
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:24,910
things own so you know a lot of again a

1109
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:25,690
lot of it is you do have to rewire your

1110
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:29,649
brain huh

1111
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:31,810
I see see some holy cows in there yeah I

1112
00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:33,520
I understood everything it said my brain

1113
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:37,060
has to been rewired I can listen to

1114
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:39,220
things on anywhere from one point two

1115
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:40,660
five one point five some people talk

1116
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:42,520
really fast like I was doing a few

1117
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:44,259
moments ago I could not listen to myself

1118
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:49,630
on 2x when I'm talking really fast like

1119
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:54,270
it's no words all that answered my

1120
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:57,190
question what question did you but

1121
00:45:54,270 --> 00:46:00,400
ultimately like that's you know that's

1122
00:45:57,190 --> 00:46:02,680
the way these things work and that's the

1123
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,690
way someone who's entirely blind sees

1124
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:11,440
the world and I hope you guys got

1125
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:13,240
something out of this and you know if

1126
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,250
you got any questions again I'm on

1127
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:18,490
Twitter at the blind hacker i'm on

1128
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:21,099
twitch i stream my streams i don't let

1129
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:22,839
the text out if i am using it sometimes

1130
00:46:21,099 --> 00:46:24,460
sometimes i do just to show you guys but

1131
00:46:22,839 --> 00:46:28,060
you know i hope you guys got something

1132
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:30,849
from this and again i'm i'm not just a

1133
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:32,529
you know accessibility ally but i want

1134
00:46:30,849 --> 00:46:34,540
you guys to take away from this what you

1135
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:36,940
