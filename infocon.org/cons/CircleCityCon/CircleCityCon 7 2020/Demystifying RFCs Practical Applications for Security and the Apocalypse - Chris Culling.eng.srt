38
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,440
there

39
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:27,280

just starting to learn python and

50
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,720
regarding assembly

51
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,879
um i think this is probably an

52
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,200
appropriate uh

53
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,200

and then the hell upon which i will die

87
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,400
jeff is pronounced like jeff like jeffy

88
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,479
but that's not it

89
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,799
because that's just silly that's the

90
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:32,080
hell upon which i will die

91
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:35,280
and who will join me because

92
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,280
oxford comma for life

93

here's my contacts if anybody's

94
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:48,080
interested in reaching out

95
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,080
and one more meme there to uh

96
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,840
translation

97
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:05,359
so requests for comments uh otherwise uh

98
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,720
uh otherwise known as rc's um

99
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,800
there are a lot of folks that haven't

100
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,479
heard of rfcs um if you haven't i hope

101
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,840
you get something out of this

102
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:16,080
uh and then there's also a large group

103
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,799
of folks who have heard of them but

104
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,560
just because they've been in class uh or

105
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,639
something that they've had to read

106
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,880
um there's a very small small group of

107
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,720
people who absolutely love rfcs

108
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,880
uh and dig into them all the time i'm

109
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,720
one of those if you are you can just

110
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,880
raise your hand where you are

111
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,880
and and no one will judge you at all

112
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:42,240
so why should we care about rfcs well

113
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:45,840
uh julia evans otherwise known as bork

114
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,560
on twitter uh does a a series of uh

115
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,280
drawings like this for uh to explain

116
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,360
different things

117
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,559
and uh she did one that covers rfcs um

118
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,560
and she pointed out the fact that they

119
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,240
define internet protocols

120
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:03,440
uh which is one of the main uh

121
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:06,479
uh reasons why the rsc series

122
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,600
exists uh is to uh explain how the

123
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,120
internet works

124
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,199
uh and so that everybody can be on the

125
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,479
same page

126
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:17,199
so the rsc series began in 1969

127
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,919
uh steve crocker one of the founders of

128
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,600
the internet

129
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:23,840
uh wrote the very first note um after

130
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,039
uh he got together with the other

131
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,880
founders of the internet

132
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,240
um in what they called the network

133
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,400
working group

134
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,240
um he wrote a note about uh just

135
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,919
kind of the the minutes of the the

136
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,520
meeting um

137
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,359
after that another individual who was

138
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,639
there wrote another

139
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,120
uh letter discussing it and by this time

140
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,720
uh steve crocker decided that uh it

141
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,520
would probably be good to have

142
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,280
a collection uh set up to track

143
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:55,280
everything that they were doing

144
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:58,400
uh and so that became rfc three

145
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,000
uh which was basically uh him

146
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:04,159
explaining that this is what he's going

147
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,759
to do and this was april 1969

148
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,520
and uh what's kind of funny is that at

149
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,360
the time uh and this is

150
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:14,159
the first paragraph of rc3 um

151
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,080
the fact that he lists puts the word

152
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,199
seems to consist of

153
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,680
for the networking working group they

154
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,639
were

155
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:26,160
just that disorganized at the time in

156
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:29,759
terms of bringing the internet online

157
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:32,000
john postel he took over uh

158
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,919
at that point and managed the rfc series

159
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,720
for 28 years until he passed away in

160
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,719
1998.

161
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,680
now the rfc series

162
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,720
you can see just i just broke it out uh

163
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,120
by number

164
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,400
uh there's eight thousand seven hundred

165
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,919
and seventy

166
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,520
uh rfcs in existence um

167
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,878
eight thousand seven hundred and eighty

168
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,240
eight is the current uh latest number

169
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,800
but this is kind of how it's broken out

170
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,520
by decade uh for anyone who's interested

171
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,960
in just

172
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:10,000
the progression of the numbering

173
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,080
and uh for the majority of this

174
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,639
presentation i've got an optional lab

175
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,520
if you do want to participate uh if you

176
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,759
want to go to rfc-editor.org

177
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,960
if you have an extra screen available

178
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:27,840
you can follow along

179
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:27,840
on what we're doing within the rc editor

180
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,200
so the rc editor is the

181
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,559
resource where you're going to find

182
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,959
basically everything that you need to

183
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,239
find

184
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,239
about rfcs online

185
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:45,760
again the address is rfc-editor.org

186
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,040
you'll find on the left you'll find uh

187
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,000
information about

188
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,800
the rc series itself uh you'll find

189
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,480
information

190
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,040
about writing rfcs on the right side

191
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,959
you'll find

192
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,560
information on notable events and recent

193
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,199
rfcs that have been

194
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,959
added to the series you can search for

195
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,680
rfcs

196
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,040
uh at the bottom uh there are links to

197
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,160
organizations that

198
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,880
participate in rfc approval process and

199
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,519
in the center

200
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,240
is the main section where you're going

201
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,760
to be searching for your rfcs

202
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,120
and i just want to point out something

203
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,160
very interesting over on the left-hand

204
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:25,600
side there under the history uh

205
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,839
tab under this the series section uh

206
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,640
there's a lot of a very interesting

207
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,920
reading

208
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:34,160
uh in that section um notes and and

209
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,920
and letters from the folks who actually

210
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,360
created the internet

211
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,920
so that's something good to look at if

212
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:43,680
you have some time

213
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:46,800
uh rfc four eight four four uh

214
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:51,120
talks about the four sources or streams

215
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,640
uh that contribute to all rfcs

216
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,080
there's the internet engineering task

217
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:58,720
force the internet research task force

218
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,040
the internet architecture board and

219
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:05,279
independent submissions

220
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:07,279
so the ietf their mission is to

221
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,279
produce high quality relevant technical

222
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:12,160
documents

223
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:14,399
that continue to allow the internet to

224
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,399
work

225
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,680
the irtf they promote research

226
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,360
and they focus on longer return research

227
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,680
issues related to the internet whereas

228
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,800
the ietf looks at much shorter

229
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:31,040
term engineering type issues

230
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,199
the irtf is broken down into a number of

231
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,680
research groups

232
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,760
there's currently 14 that are either

233
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,959
currently chartered or

234
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,160
proposed for chartering i'll give you a

235
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,839
second and take a look at some of the

236
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,600
names

237
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,279
one of them that i find quite

238
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,399
interesting apart from the quantum

239
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,560
internet research group

240
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:55,040
is the thing thing research group

241
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,760
and uh when i first saw that um of

242
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,719
course i

243
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,720
i thought of this

244
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:06,880
so it's not really applicable but

245
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,720
it's far away there's also the iab

246
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,399
they provide a long-range technical

247
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,399
direction for internet development

248
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,880
and then finally you have independent

249
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,760
submissions uh whereby anybody

250
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,120
uh outside of those groups can submit uh

251
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,560
documentation

252
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,480
uh that's relevant to the internet

253
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:28,239
community for consideration

254
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:31,120
uh to be included in the rfc series

255
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,160
so if we go back to the rfc editor the

256
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,279
main section that we're going to be

257
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:38,560
looking at

258
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:41,760
is right in the center of the rc series

259
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,279
at the top you've got links to the uh

260
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,319
four main

261
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:50,560
uh sources or streams

262
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:53,680
uh for the creation of rfcs

263
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,880
uh as you go down you can search the

264
00:11:53,680 --> 00:12:00,160
entire index by

265
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:02,959
through v either via html text or html

266
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,480
on the center section you can search by

267
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,839
status

268
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,120
which is defined by rfc 2026

269
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,279
which we're going to cover in just one

270
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,240
second you can also

271
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,680
certify the official internet standards

272
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,320
and you can look at any

273
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,800
of the changes that have ever happened

274
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,480
uh

275
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,479
to the status of an rfc

276
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,600
so several categories of rfc's

277
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,160
status you have the internet standards

278
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,800
track which specifies

279
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,880
uh the rfcs are intended to become

280
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,160
internet standards

281
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,040
and then you have the non-standards

282
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:42,000
track which are basically informational

283
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,599
so on the internet standards track you

284
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,639
have internet drafts

285
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,600
proposed standards uh the now

286
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:54,160
uh defunct draft standard and the

287
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:57,519
internet standard internet drafts

288
00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:00,880
are basically anything that's submitted

289
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:05,040
that the submitter hopes

290
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:06,800
becomes an rfc so that goes through a

291
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,599
vetting process

292
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,519
before it even gets onto the official

293
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,800
track

294
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:18,399
proposed standards are

295
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,399
as it says here generally stable

296
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:25,360
and they might need a little bit more uh

297
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,800
work out in the field uh to prove

298
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,519
themselves out before

299
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,800
they're considered uh to be an internet

300
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,920
standard

301
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,760
um but that's the first step of the

302
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,079
internet standards track

303
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,839
uh the second step used to be draft

304
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:43,760
standards

305
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:46,639
uh this used to be where it was

306
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:50,319
basically an internet standard but

307
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:54,399
almost but not yet 99

308
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:57,360
uh it did allow for vendors uh to

309
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,160
use a life utilize the standard as

310
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,199
though it were

311
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:05,199
in an internet standard

312
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:08,160
um this was take this was deleted this

313
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:10,560
uh draft standard uh part of the track

314
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,519
uh in 2011 and we'll cover that in just

315
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,359
a second

316
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,040
but some of the current existing draft

317
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,240
standards um

318
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:20,719
all your tcp congestion control

319
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,760
smtp is still considered a draft

320
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,120
standard

321
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:27,439
uh even though they got rid of the

322
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,440
category uh almost 10 years ago

323
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,040
and then finally you have your internet

324
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,479
standard

325
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:37,519
this is the top of the line this is

326
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,839
what the internet is built on this is

327
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,720
what

328
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,519
vendors should be citing when they're

329
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:46,079
talking about their

330
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:47,519
products uh and it's

331
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,439
you've made it when you're an internet

332
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,519
standard

333
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,440
so examples of internet standards are

334
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,560
you know your udp

335
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,920
uh your internet protocol your tcp so a

336
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,800
lot of the internet standards were

337
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,880
created

338
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,959
back at the beginning and they've just

339
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:08,000
been improved upon

340
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:08,000
over time rfc 6410

341
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,959
came out in october 2011 and it went

342
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,800
from

343
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:20,800
three maturity levels in the track

344
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:22,399
uh down to two uh so it got rid of the

345
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,000
draft standards

346
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,240
and it went from proposed standard to

347
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,800
internet standard

348
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,079
uh the draft standards that existed in

349
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,880
2011

350
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,399
were either to be reclassified as a

351
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,439
proposed standard

352
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:42,079
which was kind of a a step down

353
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:43,519
or turned into an internet standard

354
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,319
this was all supposed to happen within

355
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:48,720
two years so by 2013

356
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,880
all of the draft standards in the rrc

357
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,199
series were supposed to be gone

358
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,079
uh as you'll see in a little bit uh that

359
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:57,599
hasn't quite happened

360
00:15:54,079 --> 00:16:00,880
exactly then you have the non-standard

361
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,120
track these are going to be

362
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,079
consisting of your best current practice

363
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,519
informational

364
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:11,199
experimental historic uncategorized

365
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:13,759
and numbers that weren't issues

366
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:15,279
so your best current practices uh are

367
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,000
designed to be a way to standardize

368
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,759
practices

369
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,399
uh across the internet community um

370
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,160
and so it's it's uh it's exactly as you

371
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:27,199
would expect the best

372
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,199
best practice to be

373
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:37,040
some examples of best current practices

374
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:40,000
are your uh private internet allocations

375
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:42,639
uh your ten dot your 192.

376
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,680
um and the guidelines for setting up

377
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,680
autonomous systems

378
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:53,680
uh the next non-standard tracking uh

379
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:56,800
rfc uh is the informal

380
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,519
informational excuse me uh these are

381
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,439
just put out

382
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,040
uh just for general knowledge for the

383
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,319
internet community

384
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,959
um and so they're they're not

385
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,678
official doctrine uh but they are very

386
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,199
helpful uh

387
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,880
in terms of understanding how how

388
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,600
different things work

389
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,240
uh you then have experimental uh which

390
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,000
are

391
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,640
part of some sort of uh research or

392
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,480
development effort

393
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:26,319
historic rfcs

394
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:30,000
have been superseded by more recent

395
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:32,879
rfcs and have been relegated to

396
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
the status of historic uh and then

397
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,000
there's a number

398
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,360
uh that i'll talk about in a second of

399
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,799
uncategorized

400
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:44,799
rfcs that just don't have a category yet

401
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:48,400
uh they consist of the rfcs between uh

402
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:50,000
one and 11 28 um

403
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,600
many of them were obsoleted by later

404
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,760
rfcs uh

405
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,799
but we'll come back to that in a second

406
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,400
and then you just have

407
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,639
a number of rfcs that haven't been

408
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,640
issued

409
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,840
so here's a breakdown of all 8770 total

410
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:09,840
rfcs

411
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:13,199
um the most current rfc is 8788

412
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:16,159
uh which is a delta of 18 unaccounted

413
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,160
for our cities

414
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:23,360
i tried to find them i couldn't

415
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,480
so i just had to let it go but if you

416
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,678
take a look

417
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:30,880
you'll notice at the very bottom out of

418
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:34,880
the 8770 rfcs

419
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:37,200
there's only 116 in 50 years of

420
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:40,240
rfcs have existed that have been deemed

421
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,240
as internet standards

422
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:46,320
if you look at the top the proposed

423
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:49,039
standards there's 3618

424
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,720
that are just kind of hanging out there

425
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:53,760
waiting to be either

426
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:57,840
deemed an internet standard or to just

427
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,840
be dropped off the books

428
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,400
and uh closed out as a standard

429
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,120
if you look at the uncategorized there's

430
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,120
887

431
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,799
and then the

432
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:19,760
draft standard which should have

433
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,039
all been gone by 2013 there's still 139

434
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,840
of those

435
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,720
so i was fortunate enough to talk to uh

436
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,080
recent

437
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,919
past rfc editor um about

438
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,600
why the fact that there are so many

439
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,120
proposed standard

440
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,039
they haven't been turned into internet

441
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,959
standards why there's still draft

442
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:40,160
standards that exist

443
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:43,440
and why there are any uncategorized

444
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,360
and she basically told me that it was uh

445
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,840
just the fact that the folks that do

446
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,918
this work uh volunteer their time to

447
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,360
these working groups and committees

448
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,720
and uh there's enough work to do

449
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,639
that they just haven't had time to go

450
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,880
back in

451
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:02,240
so uh if a vendor tells you that

452
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:07,360
something

453
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:10,960
is uh approved by the rfc

454
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:13,360
uh as

455
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,600
it has a status um you might want to

456
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,120
take a look at what category that falls

457
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,120
in just to kind of see

458
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,158
if uh if it's is it really an internet

459
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,520
standard

460
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,760
or is it just something that's

461
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,320
informational that uh they're just

462
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:28,720
trying to

463
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:30,320
pass off as as as being doctrined

464
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,760
and this is kind of a breakdown of the

465
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,799
different uh

466
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:39,360
streams or sources the committees

467
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:41,918
and which types of rfcs that they

468
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,918
feed into

469
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:51,600
then we pull up the rfc index

470
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,600
and you have all 8 770 of them there

471
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,919
that can be kind of overwhelming look at

472
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,840
that

473
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,200
so i just want to break down just how to

474
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,678
read through uh the

475
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,360
index entries uh so you're going to

476
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,720
start off with the rc number

477
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,559
in this case 5234.

478
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,760
uh following that you're going to have

479
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:13,039
the title the

480
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:16,879
authors and the publication date

481
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:19,840
all rfcs uh are listed by

482
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,840
month and year

483
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,720
then you can have the format that the

484
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:28,320
rfcs are

485
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,080
currently online in in this case it's

486
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,720
text html

487
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,080
uh the newer rfcs are in a number of

488
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,440
different formats while

489
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:39,199
the older rfcs uh

490
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,280
are in the formats that they've been

491
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:46,640
able to either scan them into

492
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:50,559
or a digitization

493
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:52,880
uh if an rfc obsoletes a previous rfc

494
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:55,120
uh it will tell you that which is good

495
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:58,799
because then you can follow the trail

496
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:02,158
of uh how the rfcs have evolved

497
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:04,960
over the years um if it's obsoleted by

498
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,520
another rfc it will also tell you that

499
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,080
so

500
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,720
you're not going to see an rfc just by

501
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,559
itself

502
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,960
and not understand how it's related to

503
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:16,559
other rfcps

504
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:18,720
uh if an rfc updates another rfc you'll

505
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,480
see that there or if it's updated by

506
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,400
another rfc

507
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:26,799
uh and then there's sub series there's

508
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:30,240
standards uh

509
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:33,200
uh bcps and fyis and

510
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:35,200
uh if it's part of a sub series you'll

511
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,880
see which one that is

512
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,480
uh the status field will tell you what

513
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,720
the status is this particular one's an

514
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,960
internet standard

515
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,720
uh it'll tell you the stream that the

516
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,480
document that the uh rfc came

517
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,480
from and the working group that was

518
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,960
behind it if possible

519
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,760
uh and then it finishes off with uh an

520
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,679
iso

521
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:59,360
uh digital object identifier

522
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:03,120
so sample rfc header once you click on

523
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:05,840
the rfc number and you pull up the rfc

524
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,760
you'll see the header the header will

525
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,000
tell you which

526
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,440
stream it came from what the number of

527
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,799
it is

528
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:17,679
what category it falls under if it has a

529
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,679
sub-category

530
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:25,120
who the authors of the rfc

531
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:28,480
were and when the rfc was written

532
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:30,399
along with the title of the rc uh one

533
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,360
thing i wanted to point out

534
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,720
that i found while i was doing my

535
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:38,000
research for this

536
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:40,799
was that certain rfcs uh have

537
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,799
uh errata

538
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:47,918
whenever an rfc is written and published

539
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:51,520
that document stays the same

540
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:54,559
forever it never changes if there are

541
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:57,679
changes that have to be made to that

542
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:59,120
they're added to the errata section uh

543
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,760
it's very important that whenever you're

544
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:05,439
looking at an rfc

545
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:07,200
and generally you're only going to see

546
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,799
this if you're looking at it in the html

547
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,799
version

548
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:13,679
uh the pdf and the text versions won't

549
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:15,520
show you uh on the rfc itself

550
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,279
uh whether or not any changes have been

551
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,918
made uh

552
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,559
but once you'll click on the errata

553
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,360
section

554
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:25,520
and it also mentions that they're below

555
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,678
the standard that errata does exist

556
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,600
it'll take you to the page of changes

557
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,559
that have been made or updates that have

558
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,279
been made

559
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,799
to the rfc that didn't necessarily

560
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:38,000
warrant

561
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:40,320
a new rfc but are are are

562
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,679
nonetheless important to know about uh

563
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,840
if you're

564
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:46,000
researching that rfc for for whatever

565
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,480
purposes

566
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,520
uh it'll also tell you if it was

567
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,960
obsoleted by

568
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:57,120
or updated by uh any

569
00:24:52,960 --> 00:25:00,320
other rfcs and then

570
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:04,000
so what so why do we care uh

571
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:07,520
about rfcs um

572
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,159
and just out of the blue i'm just gonna

573
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,760
throw in a couple memes from my cat just

574
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,960
because i think they're funny

575
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:17,039
and just to kind of re-engage you with

576
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:20,159
uh with this uh

577
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,158
very riveting subject

578
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:30,720
so security use cases for rcs

579
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:33,520
uh rfcs tell you

580
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:36,159
what's expected of a particular protocol

581
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,158
for example

582
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,400
if you read down into the the depths of

583
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,240
that rfc

584
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,080
and you learn everything you can about

585
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,840
that protocol

586
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:49,678
you know that that protocol is supposed

587
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:53,600
to operate like that in the wild

588
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,799
well if you're an adversary

589
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,120
and you know how the protocol is

590
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,480
supposed to operate

591
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,479
you might be able to come up with some

592
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,240
ways

593
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,240
that the protocol is not expected to

594
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:08,080
operate

595
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:10,960
and get around someone's defenses

596
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,320
using those techniques so as a blue

597
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,760
teamer

598
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:19,760
you can use the rfcs to

599
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:23,840
understand more fully the protocols

600
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:27,039
and the information flow

601
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:29,199
networking of your systems

602
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:31,120
so that you can fully understand where

603
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,039
those some of the weaknesses might lie

604
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,279
within those protocols

605
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,400
uh every rfc has a security

606
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:39,120
consideration

607
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,200
section which will tell you uh what the

608
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:44,000
writers of the rfc

609
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,600
uh think are possible security

610
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,679
considerations

611
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:54,240
those are great to look at for example a

612
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:57,600
tls 1.3 just came out as a new rfc

613
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,679
as a new standard if you go

614
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,279
into it you can see the differences are

615
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:04,480
highlighted between

616
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:06,799
1.3 and 1.2 and

617
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,480
a number of new features are introduced

618
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:10,240
but also a number of

619
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,039
potential vulnerabilities that those new

620
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:15,120
features could possibly create

621
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:17,120
are explained in the security

622
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:20,719
considerations section of that

623
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,760
rfc uh red teamers you can use it the

624
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,799
same way

625
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,879
as adversary would uh in terms of

626
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:29,760
developing exploits

627
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,120
uh you dig down into a protocol deeper

628
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,799
than anybody

629
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,158
really ever goes because they don't read

630
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:36,720
the rfcs

631
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:37,760
and you can find those those small

632
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,320
little

633
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,960
uh areas where where no one's paying

634
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,200
attention

635
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:46,880
uh hardware software uh security tools

636
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,880
haven't thought about that particular

637
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,360
feature of that protocol

638
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,960
you can use that to create an exploit to

639
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:56,000
bypass

640
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,000
someone's perimeter

641
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,279
and so as much fun as that was we're

642
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,080
gonna have

643
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,480
even more fun with rfcs because they're

644
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,840
not

645
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:10,640
completely as dry and boring as

646
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,199
they look like they might be so an

647
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,960
actual

648
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,520
rfc 2119 a lot of you have probably seen

649
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,440
this

650
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,440
uh keywords for use in rfc is to

651
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,320
indicate requirement levels

652
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,960
um whenever you see must must not

653
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,480
required

654
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,240
shall shall not should should not

655
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:30,000
recommended made optional

656
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:33,600
in a document this rfc explains

657
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:36,399
how you are to interpret that

658
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,678
uh it's kind of funny they had to put

659
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:40,639
out

660
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,080
a an update rfc i don't have the number

661
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,679
off top my head

662
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:49,199
that actually specifies that the words

663
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:54,080
have to be capitalized in order for them

664
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:58,720
to mean what they mean in rsc 2119

665
00:28:54,080 --> 00:29:00,799
well then rfc 69 19 came out

666
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,279
which is further keywords for use in

667
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:06,240
rfcs to indicate requirement levels

668
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:07,440
the keywords must but we know you won't

669
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,840
should consider

670
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,960
really should not ought to would

671
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,399
probably

672
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,720
may wish to could possibly might

673
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:19,439
they're all explained in this document

674
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:22,720
as to how they should be used

675
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,919
now the header for this document you'll

676
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,039
notice

677
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:29,039
the date of

678
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,879
all the rfcs that are listed in the in

679
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:33,520
the rfc

680
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,360
uh registered the only ones that will

681
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:38,399
actually have a day

682
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:40,559
are the april fools rfcs and those will

683
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:44,158
be one april of whatever year

684
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:47,760
those were were accepted um

685
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:50,640
there are uh five non-april fool's rfcs

686
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,679
and currently 61 april fool's rfcs that

687
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,039
have been published

688
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:57,120
as official rfcs uh

689
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:59,919
probably one of the most famous

690
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:02,959
non-april fools rfcs is arpawaki

691
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:06,559
it came out in 1973.

692
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:09,919
this was a remake of lewis carroll's

693
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:12,639
nonsense poem jabberwocky uh but with a

694
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,640
little bit of

695
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,879
network engineer humor added to it

696
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:22,799
i'd recommend looking that up in

697
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,760
uh taking a run through that because

698
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:29,760
that's a a fun one

699
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:33,919
uh another notable

700
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:37,440
april 4 rfc that caught my eye was

701
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:40,960
the address is the message rfc 1776

702
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,880
came out in 1995. and basically it says

703
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:46,159
that uh

704
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,760
it's not what you know but who you know

705
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,039
choosing an addressing scheme that makes

706
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,200
possible to talk to everyone while

707
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,679
dispensing with the irrelevant overhead

708
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,240
of actually

709
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,520
having to say anything uh was very

710
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,559
important

711
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,158
so uh the address is actually the

712
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,519
message whereby you don't have to say

713
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:05,600
anything

714
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:08,159
you just address it and send it out

715
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,360
you've got rrc 1925 the 12 networking

716
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:12,320
truths

717
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,918
uh number one it has to work number two

718
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,879
no matter how hard you push no matter

719
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,279
what the priority

720
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,039
you can't increase the speed of life and

721
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:21,519
the corollary to that is no matter

722
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:23,039
how hard you try you can't make a baby

723
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,240
in much less than nine months

724
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,760
trying to speed this up might make it

725
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,000
slower but it won't make it happen any

726
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,679
quicker

727
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,120
a third networking truth is with

728
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,760
sufficient thrust

729
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,479
pigs fly just fine but it's not

730
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,600
necessarily

731
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,120
a great idea uh

732
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,399
fourth networking truth is that some

733
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,080
things in life can never be fully

734
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:44,000
appreciated nor understood unless

735
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,519
experienced firsthand

736
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,120
some things that networking can never be

737
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,799
fully understood by someone who

738
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,879
neither builds commercial networking

739
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:54,399
equipment nor runs an operational

740
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:56,480
network on number five it's always

741
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:58,000
possible to eliminate multiple separate

742
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,679
problems into a single complex

743
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,960
interdependent solution

744
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:05,279
in most cases this is a bad idea

745
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,640
number six if it's easier to move the

746
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:08,159
problem around

747
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,440
for example by moving the problem to a

748
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,640
different part of the overall network

749
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,600
architecture

750
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,600
then it is to solve it

751
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,120
and the corollary to that is it's always

752
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,760
possible to add another level of

753
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,760
indirection

754
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:26,080
number seven is it's always something

755
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:28,399
corollary to that is good fast or cheap

756
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:30,080
pick any two

757
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:32,239
number eight it's more complicated than

758
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,960
you think that's definitely a networking

759
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:37,600
truth number nine for all resources

760
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,200
whatever it is you need more

761
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,639
and the corollary to that is that every

762
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,840
networking problem always takes longer

763
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,840
to solve than it seems like it should

764
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,360
number 10 one size never fits all

765
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,240
number 11 every old idea will be

766
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,600
proposed again

767
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,840
with a different name and a different

768
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:57,199
presentation regardless of whether

769
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:59,600
it works and the corollary to that is

770
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:02,080
number six it's always possible to add

771
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,000
the level of indirection

772
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,918
and the last networking truth is in

773
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,799
protocol design perfection has been

774
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:08,799
reached

775
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:10,480
not when there is nothing left to add

776
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:12,799
but when there is nothing left to take

777
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,799
away

778
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,000
and if it bothers you then i'm reading

779
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,559
directly from the

780
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,480
uh slides i apologize but i'm taking

781
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,918
these directly out of the rfcs and

782
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,399
there's really no other way

783
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:26,399
to pass that along so um i hope you're

784
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:29,840
still enjoying it

785
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:30,959
uh rfc 2795 is the infinite monkey

786
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:34,240
protocol suite

787
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:38,000
or inps uh this is

788
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:39,440
based off of the theory that if you take

789
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,240
an infinite number of monkeys

790
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,200
put them in typewriters then eventually

791
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,720
one of them will

792
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,240
produce the entire works of william

793
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:51,279
shakespeare or a good television show

794
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,720
so the suite contains uh communications

795
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,640
and control protocols for the monkeys

796
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,600
and for the organizations that work with

797
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,120
them

798
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,158
uh there's four primary entities that

799
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,399
communicate with the imps network

800
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,519
you've got the the zoos which are the

801
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:05,678
groups of monkeys

802
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:06,799
which is where they're located you've

803
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:08,639
got the simeon

804
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,159
module which is physically attached to

805
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,440
the monkey which provides communications

806
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:15,839
between the monkey

807
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:18,240
and zoo the symbian uses the

808
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:19,599
chimp protocol to communicate with the

809
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:22,638
zoo

810
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:25,280
and the zoo uses the keeper protocol to

811
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,720
interact with the simeon

812
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,720
so whenever the zookeeper sends a

813
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:31,839
request the assembly must

814
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:33,279
send a keeper a response so

815
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:35,520
right now we're talking about that part

816
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:38,960
of the protocol

817
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:41,839
so whenever the keeper sends a code out

818
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,760
to the monkeys uh for example to check

819
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:45,918
and see if monkey has a heartbeat

820
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,320
to wake up the monkey to make sure the

821
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:51,199
monkey's typing stop

822
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,520
all monkey business then the monkey has

823
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:54,399
to

824
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:56,079
has to respond and some of the responses

825
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:57,839
is that the monkey can say he's asleep

826
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:01,680
he's not the typewriter

827
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:04,960
uh he can say he's dead um

828
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,759
the monkey can refuse to request uh if

829
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:10,560
that happens

830
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,560
then uh chances are this will probably

831
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:19,200
happen

832
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,000
another april fools rfc is the etymology

833
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,598
of foo

834
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,079
rfc 3092. uh most of us have probably

835
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:28,240
heard

836
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:30,400
of foo or fubar uh up to 2001

837
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,359
approximately seven percent of of the

838
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,920
rfcs

839
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:34,880
that had been written contained the

840
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:39,119
terms food

841
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,119
bar or fubar well

842
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,280
for non-english speakers this might

843
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:47,359
create a problem

844
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:50,480
so somebody wrote this april fool's rfc

845
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:50,880
to rectify that efficiency by explaining

846
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,440
the

847
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,920
entire etymology of foo that's

848
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:59,040
definitely a good read

849
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:01,520
and highly recommend it another good one

850
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,000
is uh the security flag in the ipv4

851
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,119
header

852
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:08,400
otherwise known as the evil bit so

853
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,400
this uh contributor

854
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:16,000
suggests that you can define

855
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:18,400
a security flag in a ipv4 header

856
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,960
as either being malicious or

857
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,599
non-malicious

858
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,240
benign packets will set their bits to

859
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,920
zero

860
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,520
those that are used for attacks will set

861
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,599
it to one that way

862
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,520
that just makes it uh a little easier

863
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:35,040
for defenders to know

864
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:36,160
what's inbound someone also thought it

865
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:39,839
would be

866
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:42,160
nice to have the tcp packets denote

867
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:45,279
their mood

868
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,279
they obviously can't feel

869
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:55,359
however a packet could get upset

870
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:57,200
you know if it's re-transmitted uh

871
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:58,880
if there's no accuracy for it it might

872
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,439
get angry or frustrated

873
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,240
and if that's the case it can change

874
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,520
some

875
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:07,520
flags in its header to denote its mood

876
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,440
and the flags break down to ascii

877
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:13,200
characters

878
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:16,000
uh emojis to illustrate how the pack is

879
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,000
feeling at the time

880
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:26,160
uh the next one is one of my favorite um

881
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:29,760
rfc 6592 uh this

882
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:32,160
uh goes into great detail uh on the null

883
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,160
packet

884
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:37,839
um

885
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,240
that's one of my favorites um highly

886
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:49,359
worth looking into

887
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:53,200
uh next one is uh rfc 7511

888
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:56,960
which proposes scenic routing for ipv6

889
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:59,520
so this uh

890
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,839
is looking at ipv6 and saying it might

891
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:05,119
need a little bit more fresh air

892
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:06,560
and so it recommends routing ipv6

893
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:10,079
packets uh

894
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:12,880
it by implementing scenic routing

895
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,160
so that you can either utilize the av

896
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,320
and ip carriers

897
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,200
wireless technologies whatever it is to

898
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,960
get

899
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:23,040
those packets out of the fiber out of

900
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,040
the ground and into the air and sunlight

901
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,839
and then you have 8135 which is complex

902
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,400
addressing in ipv6

903
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:31,599
uh someone didn't think that uh the

904
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,720
addressing scheme

905
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:37,760
for ipv6 was complex enough

906
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:41,919
so they came up with a number of new

907
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:45,280
options for addressing ipv6 package

908
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,560
uh you've got natural addresses complex

909
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,760
addresses some are

910
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:51,040
imaginary uh supported addressing

911
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,960
schemes are

912
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,160
safe addresses virtual rational

913
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,720
addresses

914
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:58,240
there's even transcendent addresses and

915
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,319
then you have the geometric addresses

916
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,799
which are my favorite which are round

917
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,839
square

918
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,839
or polar shapes

919
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,720
and then finally on some notable april

920
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:12,160
fool's rc's

921
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:16,319
is the hypertext jeopardy protocol

922
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:17,920
so hypertext jeopardy protocol htjp

923
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,359
it inverts the request response

924
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,560
semantics of the

925
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:25,759
http protocol so whereas

926
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,799
regular http would connect to a server

927
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,160
asset question

928
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,760
and expect a response hypertext jeopardy

929
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,879
protocol

930
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:37,760
sends an answer to the server and

931
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:40,839
expects the correct question

932
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:42,640
and this document explains how all that

933
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:47,200
works

934
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:50,960
so as we're going along and and

935
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:55,598
minding our own business all of a sudden

936
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:58,720
zombies or asteroids

937
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:00,800
or nuclear weapons

938
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,000
whatever it is something's going to

939
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,680
happen that's going to cause an

940
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,040
apocalypse

941
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:09,919
and when that happens all of your

942
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:12,560
electronics everything society

943
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,839
everything's done

944
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,960
and what's the most important thing that

945
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:16,960
you need to do when that happens

946
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,240
my monkeys let me know

947
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,839
and secondly

948
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,160
that's some good advice

949
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,680
so surviving the apocalypse using april

950
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:38,079
fool's rfcs

951
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,720
so as we went through those april fool's

952
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:40,480
rfcs

953
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,839
you probably never thought that there

954
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,200
were some of them

955
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,720
that we've yet to cover that might

956
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:47,359
actually save your life once the

957
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:50,720
apocalypse

958
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:53,759
continues i guess we could say or or

959
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:55,598
actually really comes uh one of the most

960
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,359
famous april fool's rc's

961
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:00,240
uh that most of you have probably heard

962
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:02,000
of is uh rfc 1149

963
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,399
uh standard for the transmission of ip

964
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:08,079
datagrams on avian carriers

965
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:11,599
otherwise known as ipo carrier pigeon

966
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:14,319
well that rfc was followed up by 2549

967
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:16,240
which is ip over avian carriers with

968
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:18,880
quality of service added

969
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:23,759
and that was followed up by 6214 which

970
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:23,760
adapts 1149 for ipv6

971
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:31,200
well there was a group in 2001

972
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:34,319
in norway the bergen linux user group

973
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:37,598
that actually did a proof of concept for

974
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:37,599
rfc 1149

975
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:43,520
they took a test packet which you see

976
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,520
here on the screen

977
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:48,799
uh this is one of the participants with

978
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:50,400
the avian carrier

979
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:53,200
they've attached the test packet to the

980
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,200
avian carrier

981
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,680
the avian carrier uh the pink packet

982
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:02,000
that's attached to its leggings

983
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:04,078
currently timing out but eventually

984
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,760
it moved on it's heading towards those

985
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:09,119
mountains over there

986
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:11,200
where the end point is

987
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:13,920
with these two gentlemen that they're

988
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,919
trying to paint

989
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:20,240
once they received a packet

990
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:22,078
they would then return the response and

991
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:24,479
you can see here this is

992
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:26,160
one of the packets being returned to the

993
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:30,560
originator

994
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:32,078
and the returned packet

995
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:35,359
and this is the group that conducted

996
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:38,160
that experiment back in 2001

997
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:39,839
and this was their uh final write-up on

998
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,359
it if you will

999
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:43,520
uh they showed that there were nine

1000
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:45,839
packages transmitted

1001
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,280
uh four packets received with a 55

1002
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:49,759
packet loss

1003
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,640
uh of those five packets that they

1004
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:54,319
didn't receive

1005
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:56,960
uh three three of the avian carriers

1006
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:57,520
didn't return during the testing period

1007
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,720
uh

1008
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:03,440
two of them that did return uh

1009
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,799
somebody forgot to shut the cage door uh

1010
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,720
at the receiving end and so they

1011
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,160
couldn't attach the packet for them to

1012
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,000
return with

1013
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,560
um they did know at the time that it

1014
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:16,079
took for these these simulated paintings

1015
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:19,119
to take place and uh each packet

1016
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:22,800
averaged 87 minutes uh

1017
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:26,319
for a pain nonetheless

1018
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:28,640
this group declared this a success

1019
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:29,359
in their final report and they were

1020
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,680
waiting for

1021
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:33,520
uh other implementations so that they

1022
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,160
could try to do some interoperability

1023
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:38,560
with

1024
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:40,560
this rfc well the value of this

1025
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,160
now that we know that this proof of

1026
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:45,279
concept works

1027
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:47,040
is that when the apocalypse comes

1028
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,680
but you want to continue your community

1029
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:52,240
computer communications

1030
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,680
there's one way to do it there's also

1031
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:55,598
another way to do it

1032
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:57,359
that uh you need to have a little bit

1033
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:59,040
more line at the site

1034
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:00,799
but it's the transmission of ipv data

1035
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:04,640
aquariums over the semifluor

1036
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:08,640
semi4 flag signaling system

1037
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:11,680
so the semaphore flag signal and the ip

1038
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:15,920
over 74 flag signaling system

1039
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:20,879
uses the traditional semaphore code

1040
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:25,119
which you can see there below to either

1041
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:27,440
transmit letters a through z

1042
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:28,480
or if you're using it in ip over

1043
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:32,640
semaphore flag

1044
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:36,480
signal system protocol you can transmit

1045
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:37,040
hex on the left and on the right you can

1046
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,160
transmit

1047
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:41,520
control signals uh this one might be a

1048
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,118
little more difficult

1049
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:45,280
uh just because of its line of sight

1050
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:48,839
requirements but nonetheless

1051
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:51,200
you can still continue your computer

1052
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:53,119
communications

1053
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:56,078
uh the last issue to discuss for the

1054
00:44:53,119 --> 00:45:00,560
apocalypse as it relates to rfcs

1055
00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:04,160
is the uh april fool's 2550 rfc

1056
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:06,319
the white 10k and beyond problem

1057
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,598
so it talks about the y2k problem that

1058
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:09,200
we had

1059
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:11,200
explains the fact why we had that

1060
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,799
problem uh

1061
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:15,359
because of the two digits that

1062
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:17,280
represented today

1063
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:19,520
so once they fixed it they thought

1064
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:22,960
everything was good to go

1065
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:25,319
but now these folks realize that this is

1066
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:27,839
only going to be good until the year

1067
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:29,200
9999

1068
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:32,799
at which case they're going to have to

1069
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:34,799
switch to five digits

1070
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,960
and so this isn't something that

1071
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:40,160
necessarily needs to be fixed today

1072
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:43,680
but if the apocalypse keeps us

1073
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:44,720
out for for many many many centuries

1074
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:47,359
this is something that's going to have

1075
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:50,720
to be considered

1076
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:53,680
and just for fun decide to throw in

1077
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,680
one more meme there

1078
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:02,240
so in conclusion rfcs contain a vast

1079
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:05,839
amount of information

1080
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:08,640
um they are in all honesty

1081
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:11,040
it is a very dry subject but once you

1082
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:13,759
start exploring rfcs

1083
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:15,200
once you start exploring the the website

1084
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:16,880
that contains them

1085
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,560
and you see how they interact with each

1086
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,880
other and you just see that

1087
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,599
the depth of knowledge that can be found

1088
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,200
in them

1089
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,880
uh you may want to continue doing it

1090
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:27,279
even more um

1091
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:28,000
what's especially interesting are the

1092
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:31,280
very early

1093
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:34,319
rfcs uh the very early rfcs

1094
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:37,839
were more of communications

1095
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:40,319
uh letters and notes uh emails between

1096
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:41,680
the founders of the internet and what

1097
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:44,240
their thoughts were

1098
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,598
on what they were creating uh the

1099
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:47,200
problems that they were seeing

1100
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:49,119
and how they were going about fixing

1101
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,960
that uh so it just it

1102
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:52,319
it just makes a very interesting reading

1103
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,960
to see

1104
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:56,880
where the internet came from and what

1105
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,280
the folks who created it were thinking

1106
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:01,599
at the time

1107
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:04,560
secondly rc's are your friend and they

1108
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:04,560
do love you very much

1109
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:10,000
and again rfc-editor.org

1110
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:14,319
is where you can find everything you

1111
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:16,160
need for rfcs uh also tools.ietf.org has

1112
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:19,440
a lot of great information

1113
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:22,160
uh on uh the process uh whereby uh the

1114
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:25,920
internet standards are created

1115
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:26,640
i did wanna plug a book uh where wizards

1116
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,119
stay up late

1117
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:30,879
uh the origins of the internet um this

1118
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:34,480
is a fantastic read

1119
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:36,800
and uh it it you

1120
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,760
are right there as the internet is being

1121
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,839
developed

1122
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,200
it's very interesting for those of you

1123
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:42,720
who are interested in the history of the

1124
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,160
internet

1125
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:46,319
and just a few public service

1126
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:50,319
announcements and then i'm finished

1127
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:50,319
always remember safety third

1128
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:55,279
sticker on twitter has all your safety

1129
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:59,040
third needs

1130
00:47:55,280 --> 00:48:01,440
uh go check her out

1131
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,960
and then friends don't let friends drink

1132
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:06,400
ever

1133
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:08,640
melor so uh

1134
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,319
some of you out there who who do let

1135
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:14,160
friends drink milort

1136
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:16,880
you're wrong so don't do it again

1137
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:18,399
and then i i can't say thank you without

1138
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:21,920
a meme

1139
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:23,040
so here's my meme saying thank you

1140
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,680
and i would just like to thank you for

1141
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:28,880
attending um

1142
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:31,919
this has been great uh the uh staff

1143
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:34,559
at circle city has been so wonderful

1144
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,920
uh the way they pulled this off was uh

1145
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:38,160
just awesome

1146
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:40,559
and uh i'm very honored to have been

1147
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:48,160

1148
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:50,240
so thank you very much

1149
