00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:27,090
please welcome Nathan Sweeney to the

2
00:00:26,009 --> 00:00:29,250
stream with their talk

3
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:33,390
no one cares how we you are providing

4
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:36,449
actual value and penetration tests thank

5
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,460
you so this is normally the point in a

6
00:00:36,449 --> 00:00:39,780
live presentation where I would kind of

7
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,149
pull the audience a little bit and find

8
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,320
out who's here who's not what we're

9
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:44,430
looking at I know it's kind of late on a

10
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,350
Sunday getting towards the end of the

11
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,809
con so I'm not sure how many folks are

12
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:51,000
still around but I prefer to have

13
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:53,428
back-and-forth I love presentations to

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,230
be more of a conversation so I'm gonna

15
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:57,089
do my best to kind of monitor discord

16
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,169
we'll see what happens but anybody

17
00:00:57,089 --> 00:01:01,199
that's watching I would love for you to

18
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,619
kind of facilitate answer my questions

19
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:07,440
throw stuff out whatever you may have

20
00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:09,390
I'm really interested in what are the

21
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,920
makeup are of our audiences whether

22
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,630
you're you know on the defensive side on

23
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,720
the blue team or maybe on the red team

24
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:18,568
if you're non security IT management

25
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,369
sales all that kind of thing so if maybe

26
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:22,649
if we could if if you just want to type

27
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:25,200
in in discord they're you know hey Red

28
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:29,070
Team Blue team developer IT whatever

29
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,470
that I might give me some ideas on kind

30
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,548
of how to drive the conversation if

31
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,450
nothing else it'll tell me who I'm gonna

32
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:38,490
offend and maybe help prevent that some

33
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:40,079
but realistically the you know everybody

34
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,369
comes at pentest from a different

35
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,270
perspective and really all security

36
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:44,579
controls they come from different

37
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,479
perspectives perfect I love that guys

38
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:48,570

39
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,549
so the it's good to have the kind of

40
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:53,939

email address so I've been doing this

58
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,610
pen testing thing for quite a while

59
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:36,810
I'm gonna say 10 years ish worked with a

60
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:39,450
lot of different clients a lot of

61
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,010
different sizes extremely big I mean

62
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:43,260
we've got you know fortune 50 customers

63
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:45,750
really small startups with 10 employees

64
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,548
a lot of different industries energy

65
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,340
banking and education government you

66
00:02:47,549 --> 00:02:53,400
know whatever kind of across the the

67
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,629
realm we've done a lot of consulting

68
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,269
engagements a lot of pen tests over the

69
00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:58,560
years and they're all different but in

70
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:01,110
some cases they're all the same like

71
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,549
there's some standard things and usually

72
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:05,430
we can kind of tell early on like hey

73
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:06,599
this is going bad and you can kind of

74
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:10,530
get a feel for that from the client

75
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:11,670
what's going on and so my goal for this

76
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,069
talk because I kind of want to talk

77
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:15,869
about how do we improve that you know if

78
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:18,208
if you're on the red team it looks like

79
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:21,090
I'm seeing mostly blue a few a few

80
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:23,099
purple folks down there if you're on the

81
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,540
red team I want to give you some

82
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:25,920
specific things that you can do to make

83
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,690
your tests better and how to work with

84
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,390
the organizations that you're testing to

85
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:33,840
to improve that process if you're on the

86
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:35,458
blue team I'll try to kind of drive some

87
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,810
of this from that perspective of here

88
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:40,049
are things you should be expecting from

89
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:45,000
your from your services company here are

90
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:46,620
the types of things alright so I just

91
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,010
learned this if you tagged me I get I

92
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,780
get ding so maybe I'll try not to pay

93
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:54,780
attention to that we'll see so anyways

94
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,220
we're gonna walk through here a lot of

95
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,660
people think this is the image of

96
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:00,090
hacking right this is this is what

97
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:03,389
hacking is all about the thing is this

98
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:04,620
is a movie it's a great movie you know

99
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:07,199
it's one of my favorites but it's still

100
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,419
a movie it's not real life for a lot of

101
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:11,639
us that grew up in kind of my generation

102
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:16,228
this was fairly foundational in our view

103
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:18,810
of of who hackers are and what the

104
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:20,459
hacker culture looked like we related to

105
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,108
this we kind of clung to it as like hey

106
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,699
this is about me

107
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:26,190
you know the whole stick it to the man

108
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:28,349
lots of bravado look how awesome I am

109
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:30,120
and you know I'm better than you are and

110
00:04:28,349 --> 00:04:34,770
that kind of back and forth and a lot of

111
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:37,440
our a lot of the culture of the hacker

112
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:39,630
community is based on that and and I

113
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,770
don't want to say that's bad but when we

114
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,300
talk about penetration testing

115
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:44,010
specifically when we when we move from

116
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,960
the hacker culture into more of the

117
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:47,039
professional interest set culture

118
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,289
we have to figure out how to balance

119
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:51,930
that and kind of put aside some of that

120
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:55,050
bravado because honestly businesses

121
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:56,250
don't care I'll come back to that for

122
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,199
some of us maybe that are a little bit

123
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:00,120
older this came out in 86 the conscious

124
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:02,580
of a hacker some some people know it is

125
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,650
the hackers manifesto you know this was

126
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:07,859
the same kind of glorification of look

127
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:09,330
how awesome I am you know a lot of us at

128
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,000
that time we're kind of kids looking for

129
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:14,729
an identity computers help helped fill

130
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,169
that gap and you know a lot a lot of

131
00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:17,400
folks in our community never really grew

132
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:22,530
up you know still trying to maintain

133
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:25,039
that that I don't even know what to call

134
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:27,570
it it's it's like a fake hackers right

135
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:30,840
we see the same thing glorified in the

136
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:33,449
media you know mr. robot or NCIS or

137
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,969
blackhat you know the media has kind of

138
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:40,710
exploited this whole concept of what a

139
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:42,990
hacker is I love ya paraphrasing deviant

140
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:45,630
[ __ ] you you're not red teaming that was

141
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:48,630
actually he's absolutely right and

142
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:50,699
honestly you could probably skip this

143
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:52,590
and go watch his talk he probably said

144
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:54,210
what I'm gonna say a little bit better I

145
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:56,250
don't even know if that's recorded

146
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:58,349
anywhere but I remember seeing it but

147
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:00,750
the media has defined hacking and

148
00:05:58,349 --> 00:06:04,110
painted this image of what's expected of

149
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:06,659
us right they've glorified the hack and

150
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:08,669
and for the most of the world that's

151
00:06:06,659 --> 00:06:10,259
what they expect I was at Def Con years

152
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:13,770
ago I actually was it was still at the

153
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:15,210
Riv and there was a lady in the casino

154
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:17,940
working and she was asking like hey

155
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:19,830
what's going on what's the deal why are

156
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,270
all these kids and black shirts running

157
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,289
around and you know I kind of told her

158
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:25,080
what the conference is and what was

159
00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:26,880
going on and she said he's like is that

160
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,109
is that really like like hacking right

161
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,509
like they're doing like in the movies

162
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:32,520
and I I struggled with that like how to

163
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:34,530
answer and I asked her I'm like well

164
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,690
you've seen Ocean's eleven right like is

165
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:41,059
that how Casino works and she kind of

166
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:44,699
like oh I mean sorta but not not really

167
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:46,889
and and like there's some truth to it

168
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:48,419
right the the hacker mentality the

169
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:49,889
hacker view that is out there in the

170
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:53,219
movies there's always a little bit of

171
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:56,729
truth to it but the the glorification of

172
00:06:53,219 --> 00:06:59,240
that is is a little different and that

173
00:06:56,729 --> 00:07:01,849
is something that's fairly unique to our

174
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:04,180
profession but not completely there's

175
00:07:01,849 --> 00:07:07,130
some some definite parallels I think to

176
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:09,759
what we see in law enforcement with

177
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:14,349
police and military we see where the

178
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:17,660
movies and TV and the media ramp up and

179
00:07:14,349 --> 00:07:22,419
glorify certain individuals you know the

180
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:25,340
this amazing guy I got Bruce Willis and

181
00:07:22,419 --> 00:07:27,139
that Christmas movie I'm one blank but

182
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:29,869
you know what I'm talking about

183
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:31,880
you know like we glorify the individual

184
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:35,810
doing this great thing and we've got to

185
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:37,759
stop doing that when it comes down to it

186
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:42,020
nobody really cares how long you've been

187
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:43,720
around I die hard thank you guys man I

188
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:46,698
was struggling with that one

189
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,930
we've all had past we've all done

190
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:51,139
different stuff you know when I first

191
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:52,819
got into security it was I was even

192
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:54,650
getting into security I was interested I

193
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:57,620
was a teenager poking around and stuff

194
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:59,299
how many people remember tone loke Tone

195
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,979
Loc I'm not sure how to pronounce that I

196
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,949
always said tone low but the war dialing

197
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:06,199
software from gosh the 80s 90s I

198
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:07,400
remember when it came out that was my

199
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:09,110
first experience I lived in a really

200
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,219
small town we didn't have access to

201
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,320
bulletin boards because that was long

202
00:08:10,219 --> 00:08:13,820
distance and I couldn't afford that but

203
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,460
I had the idea of like hey I'm gonna war

204
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:17,979
dial the the local prefixes and see what

205
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,729
I can find

206
00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:21,800
unfortunately that's how I learned about

207
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:23,060
caller ID that was a new thing

208
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,710
that I didn't know about at the time so

209
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,969
you know my parents start getting calls

210
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,380
in the middle of day saying why did you

211
00:08:25,969 --> 00:08:30,289
someone from your number to call us at

212
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:33,260
3:00 a.m. last night and I had a hard

213
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:36,110
time explaining that side no completely

214
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:37,669
different completely unrelated HD more

215
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:38,990
has a product called Rumble that he's

216
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:41,059
put out there for doing network

217
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:42,740
discovery stuff it's really cool the

218
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:44,959
reason I mentioned that is he copied

219
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:46,790
tone loke into it so it actually has

220
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,630
kind of the same look and feel and

221
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:51,709
functionality as what that had so I

222
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:54,350
totally unrelated to anything else but I

223
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:55,969
thought was interesting but back to the

224
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:57,800
point we all like to tell stories we

225
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:59,000
like to talk about the good old days we

226
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,370
like to remember the way things were and

227
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,110
where things happen but really our

228
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:05,480
clients don't care like the people that

229
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:07,250
are paying us for services they don't

230
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,750
care about how great things were or the

231
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,910
cool things we did I mean they like to

232
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:12,529
hear those stories but ultimately they

233
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:14,569
want results right they're putting

234
00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:18,620
into our pockets to provide something

235
00:09:14,569 --> 00:09:19,819
and and you know I kind of want to jump

236
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:22,220
back on some of the stuff Mitchell said

237
00:09:19,819 --> 00:09:25,279
in the previous talk you know it's

238
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:26,749
really important that we provide

239
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,809
services that are valuable to the

240
00:09:26,749 --> 00:09:31,189
company not just you know hey we did

241
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:32,680
this thing and look how awesome we are

242
00:09:31,189 --> 00:09:35,349
and whatnot

243
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:37,670
yeah Tone Loc was a funky cold Medina

244
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:40,870
there was also a tool I don't know who

245
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:43,878
wrote it back in the day same same name

246
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:46,339
so one other thing on this before I move

247
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:47,870
on just to be clear checking BIOS is

248
00:09:46,339 --> 00:09:50,540
good right if you're having a pen test

249
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:52,249
done it's absolutely a good idea to say

250
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:54,529
hey can I get a copy of the BIOS or the

251
00:09:52,249 --> 00:09:56,389
resumes from the people who will

252
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:58,639
actually be doing the test sometimes

253
00:09:56,389 --> 00:10:00,620
like with our company depending on

254
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:02,120
scheduling and and what's going on and

255
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,410
the particulars of the client we may not

256
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,389
necessarily know who's gonna be doing

257
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:06,439
the test we can we can say you know hey

258
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:07,879
here's the bios of our senior

259
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,439
consultants and one or two of them will

260
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:12,410
be doing this test depending on

261
00:10:09,439 --> 00:10:16,189
scheduling that's that's absolutely a

262
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:19,309
good thing but if you're you know fairly

263
00:10:16,189 --> 00:10:21,589
new to to red teaming or you know just

264
00:10:19,309 --> 00:10:23,389
getting in and you don't have that long

265
00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:24,649
history that long background look I've

266
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:26,540
been doing this for 10 years or whatever

267
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:27,980
that doesn't necessarily preclude you

268
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:30,980
you can still provide value to the

269
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,790
organization and you know as I get in

270
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,350
here a little bit further I want to

271
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:36,170
provide some examples of specific things

272
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:38,870
you could do for that nobody cares how

273
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:40,939
great you look in a knit sweater I just

274
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:44,089
love this picture I was like like I have

275
00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:46,250
to include this somehow really the only

276
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:48,350
reason this is in here I was more

277
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:51,439
tempted to say or a black utility kilt

278
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:53,809
I'm curious like if you go to most

279
00:10:51,439 --> 00:10:55,579
hacker cons there's at least three or

280
00:10:53,809 --> 00:10:58,459
four guys walking around in and that

281
00:10:55,579 --> 00:11:00,559
black utility kilts I want to know how

282
00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:02,899
many of you are wearing them now like

283
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:04,009
how many people put on that same gear

284
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:05,809
that you would wear to the hacker con

285
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:07,990
and are wearing it for the virtual stuff

286
00:11:05,809 --> 00:11:12,199
anybody didn't want to admit to that oh

287
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:14,360
wait no I'm not really gonna wait but my

288
00:11:12,199 --> 00:11:17,059
very first black hat party that I ever

289
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:19,579
went to I was a volunteer got to go to

290
00:11:17,059 --> 00:11:21,679
one of the parties and some dude comes

291
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:22,910
walking up to me and I mean he was I

292
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:24,829
think he was probably already drunk but

293
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:26,089
he was very clearly like he was going to

294
00:11:24,829 --> 00:11:28,339
Def Con and he had

295
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:30,800
crash the black hat party and he just

296
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:32,840
went off on me on you know you're

297
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,189
obviously an InfoSec tool and not a real

298
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,350
hacker and you know you don't have

299
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:37,820
whatever the black t-shirt and you're

300
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:39,500
not you know I was probably wearing a

301
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:41,930
polo shirt right maybe khakis I don't

302
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,130
have a clue but it's just it's funny

303
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:45,560
like if you go to black hat then you go

304
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:47,210
to DEFCON there's this whole this shift

305
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:50,170
in mentality between you know I'm

306
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:52,130
professional InfoSec versus I'm a hacker

307
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:53,810
at the end of the day people don't

308
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:54,980
really care nobody cares if you're if

309
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:59,689
you're stuck and you're hung up on that

310
00:11:54,980 --> 00:12:01,310
get over it move on and nobody really

311
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:04,610
cares about the amazing hardware you've

312
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:06,500
hacked right I'm trying really hard not

313
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:08,030
to mention the United they watch me hack

314
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,680
this plane thing we all know what

315
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,790
happened yeah do you even see the Ebro

316
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,209
that's exactly right

317
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:16,550
I let's be clear I have no CV East my

318
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:18,950
name that I know of I don't think maybe

319
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:21,199
I should question that I found a whole

320
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:24,170
bunch of stuff that are all under NDA

321
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,690
for the particular client that we found

322
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:28,910
it for I've encouraged them say hey you

323
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:29,990
should report this but it you know I

324
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:31,520
don't get credit for that when that

325
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:34,610
happens I'm okay with that because

326
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,810
honestly I don't care now there are some

327
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:38,870
exceptions when it comes to hardware

328
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:41,449
right if if if you're in an environment

329
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:43,120
with SCADA stuff or mainframes or

330
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:45,710
particular types of hardware you

331
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,060
absolutely want testers to come in that

332
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:49,520
understand that hardware that have some

333
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:55,339
experience and I've dealt with that sort

334
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:57,829
of thing but here's an example we are

335
00:12:55,340 --> 00:13:00,050
currently doing a test for a client and

336
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:02,120
we're testing some systems that are

337
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:05,990
literally connected to internal body

338
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:09,590
parts like the systems if we crash them

339
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:12,920
that could cause bad bad stuff to happen

340
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:15,050
to people that's really really cool but

341
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,729
it's completely unreal event your

342
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:19,520
relevant irrelevant irrelevant I don't

343
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:21,200
know it doesn't matter to the vast

344
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,550
majority of our clients right very few

345
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,110
people are deal with that sort of thing

346
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:25,459
so being able to say hey look at this

347
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:27,230
cool thing I got I mean that's a great

348
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,520
story it makes something cool to post on

349
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:30,770
Twitter or whatnot obviously we can't

350
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:32,180
post a lot of details but you don't have

351
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:33,980
to have that amazing story you don't

352
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:35,329
have to have this crazy experience or

353
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,760
this really in-depth knowledge of this

354
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:38,680
particular hardware or that thing

355
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,680
that doesn't really make you cool that

356
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:46,180
doesn't make you amazing or incapable

357
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:47,880
either way of providing value to to your

358
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:50,160
clients

359
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:55,480
how many people remember this guy

360
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:57,579
Gregory Evans anybody look at security I

361
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,170
think it was the world's number one

362
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:01,450
hacker if you don't remember gosh I

363
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:06,189
don't even wanna go this was maybe 2008

364
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:08,800
2009 this guy made a splash in in in

365
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:10,270
kind of our world and and said you know

366
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,609
hey I'm I'm the world's number one

367
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:14,680
hacker everybody should be like me he

368
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:17,560
was all over the news he was on CNN and

369
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:19,120
whatnot and oh my gosh for maybe like

370
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:22,150
six months like that's all we've talked

371
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,370
about I remember like you go to security

372
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:25,329
conferences and everybody's badge you

373
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:27,610
know they would they would put their

374
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:30,370
name is Gregory Evans it was great

375
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:31,930
I remember he made the comment and I

376
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,400
don't remember what what station it was

377
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:35,290
or you know whatever he was on the news

378
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,930
that's Gregory D Evans to you that's

379
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:40,150
right good job man he said if you're a

380
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:42,400
hacker and you don't have at least a

381
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:44,800
million dollars already you suck at it

382
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,569
and like that just made me laugh so I

383
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:50,050
like I'm like no that's a criminal dude

384
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:53,350
that's not a hacker he was so bold and

385
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:55,900
up in your face he was a showman right

386
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:57,970
he was a he was a Donald Trump or a

387
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:59,890
Robert Schuller or you know these guys

388
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:01,240
that are all about giving people what

389
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:04,030
they want to hear and giving giving

390
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:06,450
people that show and honestly the media

391
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:10,180
ate him up right they loved it because

392
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:12,730
it drew people in it was it fit the look

393
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:14,680
they wanted to sell but here's the thing

394
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:17,680
if you guys have the same haircut though

395
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,120
that's true I am doing my best I love

396
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,280
that you know this is the haircut thing

397
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,510
I used to have a really short beard

398
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,430
sorry we're gonna take a little side

399
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:26,050
side trip here I used to have a really

400
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:27,849
short little go-to goatee and whatnot

401
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,050
and my wife kept saying dude you should

402
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:31,660
shave your head you have a good-looking

403
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:32,650
head it'd be a good shape I think she

404
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:35,020
was trying to tell me I was going bald

405
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:36,819
but you know I'm emirate different

406
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:38,470
remember differently but she kept saying

407
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:40,180
uh finally one day I'm like all right

408
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:42,550
tell you what I'm gonna shave my head

409
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:43,420
all right oh yeah I'll shave my head but

410
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,680
I'm gonna grow one of those duck

411
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:46,240
commander beards this was like before

412
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:49,150
duck dynasty this was when they just

413
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,470
sold you know duck calls and she turns

414
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:53,380
and looks at me she goes

415
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:55,060
deal and then I had this like blank look

416
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:57,160
on my face I'm like oh crap

417
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:59,560
was I bluffing it was she bluffing or I

418
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:02,199
don't know so long story I went to

419
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:04,479
DEFCON I did a Mohawks for charity thing

420
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:06,220
I gave 50 bucks - I think it was hackers

421
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,330
for charity and started growing my beard

422
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:10,630
out and here we go that was like a

423
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:12,130
decade ago but back to Gregory the Evans

424
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:14,530
as he spent way too much time on the

425
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:17,650
screen already what actual value did he

426
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:19,180
provide I I challenge you to find any of

427
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:21,100
his former customers that say yeah he

428
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,989
really helped us out how long did the

429
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:25,060
beard take to grow man I got about this

430
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:27,130
length in like seven months eight months

431
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:29,079
and that was around ten years ago and it

432
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:30,790
has it grown any further you came to see

433
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:34,150
the bottom oh there we go

434
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:36,400
so yeah this is like the epitome of

435
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:38,620
bravado when I talked about the hackers

436
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,449
movie and and the hackers manifesto and

437
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:42,010
a lot of the hacker culture it's all

438
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:44,230
about look how great I am look how

439
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:47,280
awesome I am social media and Twitter

440
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:50,740
amplifies that product that that message

441
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:52,720
there's no there's nothing of use there

442
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:54,040
right there we don't want to be that guy

443
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,810
that's not who you should be looking up

444
00:16:54,040 --> 00:17:00,310
to so I want you to think about what

445
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:02,319
value do you provide to your

446
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,430
organization and I know we've got a lot

447
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,850
of folks that said they were more blue

448
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:07,990
team and this applies you know I I come

449
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:09,250
at stuff from a pen testing perspective

450
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:11,800
because that's what I've been doing for

451
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:15,819
the last decade but it applies for a

452
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:18,810
blue team stuff as well the businesses

453
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:24,069
care about just one thing it's all about

454
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:26,919
the ROI right are you creating value for

455
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:32,740
the organization or you costing the

456
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:34,270
organization in some way okay awesome

457
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,590
want to make sure it wasn't it wasn't me

458
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:37,810
apparently some audio issues there for a

459
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:39,610
few folks most people assume that

460
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:41,260
security will always be a cost to the

461
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:42,850
org I've heard that said people say you

462
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,640
know what cost will never security we'll

463
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:46,810
never make money it's never gonna be a

464
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,760
value to the organization it's always

465
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:51,159
gonna be cost but I think we can change

466
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:53,740
that and and I disagree a little bit let

467
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:55,090
me let me explain why so one of the

468
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,170
things that we have to talk about when

469
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:59,060
we talk about security and and

470
00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:01,160
for any security control but especially

471
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:03,440
for pen tests we need to understand what

472
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,870
are the business's goals right what is

473
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,030
the what is the purpose for that

474
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:10,340
business what is their overarching like

475
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:12,590
what are they trying to do how do they

476
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:14,120
make money maybe what could prevent them

477
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:15,590
from making money maybe it's not money

478
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,449
maybe it's services right their goal is

479
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:18,679
to provide certain services to sectors

480
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:20,450
you know maybe it's nonprofit there's a

481
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:23,990
lot of different things to consider but

482
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:26,060
that that root concept of what is the

483
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:27,860
goal of the organization what is the

484
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:29,659
goal of the security control what is the

485
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:32,270
goal of the test those things need to

486
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:35,000
all come into play when we talk about

487
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:36,680
security controls and it all ultimately

488
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,230
talk about security it's about defining

489
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:41,240
risks what is the risk to your

490
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:42,650
organization right I can say you know

491
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,630
hey you got blue keep across your

492
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:46,700
organization that's fine but what's the

493
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:48,830
actual risk you know just saying well

494
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:51,920
this needs to be patched doesn't tell

495
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:56,899
the the the executive suite anything

496
00:18:51,920 --> 00:19:00,140
significant and so I want to make risk

497
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:01,760
as quantifiable as possible a lot of

498
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,860
times a lot of security people kind of

499
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,990
use FUD you know fear uncertainty and

500
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:08,780
doubt to say hey this is really bad we

501
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:09,980
got to do this thing or it's really

502
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,600
common to get up in front of the board

503
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:13,100
and do you know here let me do this

504
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,570
hacking demonstration and so you how

505
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:17,179
easily it would be to compromise our

506
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:20,210
systems and whatnot those are valid

507
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:22,430
selling techniques but they can also be

508
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:24,500
used maliciously and what ends up

509
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:26,030
happening is we create all this fear and

510
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,230
we say you have to do this thing that I

511
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:29,360
want you to do you have to give me this

512
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:31,160
money you have to approve this policy or

513
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,830
whatever or all this bad stuffs gonna

514
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:35,990
happen and that bad stuff is really

515
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:38,689
nebulous like we don't we don't clearly

516
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:41,000
define it so my goal the way I approach

517
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:44,420
pen testing or any kind of security

518
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:48,010
consulting engagement it is I want to

519
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:50,960
try to quantify the risk and provide

520
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:55,040
actual information that those leaders

521
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:57,200
can use to decide where to go here's an

522
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:59,720
example if I compromised an organization

523
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,630
and I tell your CEO that I got domain

524
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,900
admin okay he may know what that means

525
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:06,429
he may not I I would

526
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:08,950
be willing to argue that a large number

527
00:20:06,429 --> 00:20:10,390
of CEOs have no clue what it means that

528
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:12,730
I got domain admin it probably sounds

529
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:13,990
bad and the confidence with which I say

530
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:16,690
it they're probably like Oh what do we

531
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:19,720
do now but if I tell them I got access

532
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:21,549
to your email and was able to review the

533
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:24,070
big top-secret merger details that

534
00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:26,020
nobody knows about that all of a sudden

535
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:28,600
is much more practical that's realistic

536
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:31,600
they can look that and they say oh crap

537
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:33,760
this is big right the cause I got domain

538
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,279
admin or I access these merger details

539
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,929
the actual cause may be the same the

540
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:39,610
actual solution here's what you need to

541
00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:41,770
do to prevent this those things may be

542
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:45,340
the same but we're putting more

543
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:46,629
quantifiable terms on the actual risk

544
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:53,620
and so that's kind of our overarching

545
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:55,929
goal we also have different goals within

546
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:57,428
different business units so again I'm

547
00:20:55,929 --> 00:20:58,929
I'm I'm kind of talking specifically

548
00:20:57,429 --> 00:21:01,990
about pen tests but this applies more

549
00:20:58,929 --> 00:21:05,409
more broadly you know every organization

550
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:07,000
is different and every business unit

551
00:21:05,409 --> 00:21:08,950
within the organization is different so

552
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,120
you have IT departments that they

553
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:11,559
legitimately they want to know what's

554
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,539
going on in their network right I'm

555
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:14,860
being hopeful here obviously there's

556
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:16,559
some that maybe they want to hide what's

557
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:19,889
going on they don't want anybody to know

558
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:22,210
you have security departments sometimes

559
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:23,370
again they're legitimately hey we need

560
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:25,179
an assessment to see how we're doing

561
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:26,439
sometimes they think we're doing really

562
00:21:25,179 --> 00:21:28,750
good and we just wanna have somebody

563
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,179
double-check it more often than not

564
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:32,799
security already knows what's wrong with

565
00:21:31,179 --> 00:21:34,000
their network they know the weaknesses

566
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:36,370
they know the things that we're probably

567
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,690
gonna exploit they need somebody to

568
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:39,668
convince the c-suite right they need

569
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:41,529
they need to use this as a hammer I tell

570
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:43,240
people's at some point a I don't like

571
00:21:41,529 --> 00:21:44,559
that thought process but if you have to

572
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:47,220
use me as a hammer to get something

573
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:54,940
across then let's do it

574
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:56,860
the sometimes there are political issues

575
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:59,260
that prevent something from getting

576
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:01,840
fixed right and so the security team

577
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:03,010
needs the pen test to say a certain

578
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,889
thing or to use certain language

579
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:08,289
whatever so that it comes across in the

580
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:10,299
right the right way executives have

581
00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:12,908
different goals right their goal might

582
00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:14,350
be this is best practice I read about it

583
00:22:12,909 --> 00:22:16,720
in a magazine I think we need to do this

584
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:18,340
this is I'm really concerned that our

585
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,080
people are doing the right thing

586
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:23,949
maybe it's you know what I don't want to

587
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:25,840
be the next Experian or Capital One or

588
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:27,610
you know whoever the the breach of the

589
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,049
week is and so they're looking at it

590
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:31,570
from from that perspective

591
00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:33,580
you've got audited apartments they come

592
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:35,590
out with a lot of pen test especially in

593
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:40,330
certain industries are commissioned by

594
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:42,399
the auto department the sometimes

595
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:44,470
they're looking at it as hey we're just

596
00:22:42,399 --> 00:22:46,570
trying to follow up and do you know we

597
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:48,120
can make sure that the organization is

598
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:50,889
do doing what it's supposed to

599
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:52,350
compliance is kind of along that same

600
00:22:50,889 --> 00:22:55,000
lines but sometimes a little different

601
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:57,250
pci drives a lot of penetration testing

602
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,110
and Mitchell in the previous talk talked

603
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,760
about how poorly understood some of

604
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:02,979
those PCI requirements are you know

605
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,570
people might understand hey requirement

606
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:06,630
number eleven says you've got to have an

607
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:08,769
internal external pin test once a year

608
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:09,970
but a lot of people don't know much

609
00:23:08,769 --> 00:23:11,919
beyond that you know they haven't gone

610
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:13,360
through and read the the supplemental

611
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,850
guidance that the council put out and

612
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,439
you know they have AK USA who doesn't

613
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:19,899
care or doesn't know and hasn't done

614
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:23,710
much there so there's a lot of different

615
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:24,908
goals that come into play we need to

616
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:27,220
make sure that we are working to be a

617
00:23:24,909 --> 00:23:30,549
point of cooperation rather than just a

618
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:33,880
point of contention I always like it I

619
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:36,250
did a test last week for a bank and it

620
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:38,139
was commissioned by audit but it was ran

621
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:40,419
by IT and they worked very closely

622
00:23:38,139 --> 00:23:42,250
together everybody was on board and they

623
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:45,190
looked at it as you know we don't want

624
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:46,720
to just find you know find out where

625
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:48,250
we're doing wrong we want to learn as

626
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,779
much as possible whatever you can teach

627
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:51,159
us we want to find out how do our

628
00:23:49,779 --> 00:23:54,909
solutions work how do these controls

629
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:58,090
work and and if that type of testing

630
00:23:54,909 --> 00:24:01,240
goes really really well yeah it's hard

631
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:03,490
to believe USA's don't care right if

632
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:06,549
you're a vendor don't be the sleazy

633
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:08,320
salesman know what you do well what your

634
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:11,350
company does well and and what you don't

635
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:13,840
do don't be afraid to say no so many

636
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:15,129
salespeople don't want to say no maybe

637
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,199
they're desperate maybe they're working

638
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:18,580
on Commission maybe whatever you know

639
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,320
maybe sales are down and they're just

640
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:21,158
struggling whatnot and so customer asks

641
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,710
for something and they're like yeah we

642
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:25,559
can do it we're a fairly small company

643
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:28,240
we've we've intentionally stayed small

644
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:30,428
specifically because we have the ability

645
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,550
to say no to things that we don't want

646
00:24:30,429 --> 00:24:34,360
to

647
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:36,730
or they were not good at the other part

648
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:39,580
of that it sails is hard like I get it

649
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:41,920
it's it's really hard to design a

650
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:44,740
service that's unique to each individual

651
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:46,540
customer it's very tempting to kind of

652
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:47,830
have cookie cutter services and

653
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:50,020
everybody falls in that boat you know

654
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:51,970
you you have the best pen testing

655
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:53,590
companies out there sometimes you're

656
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:56,530
gonna basically get sort of a cookie

657
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:58,810
cutter service every company is going to

658
00:24:56,530 --> 00:25:00,460
have times where they excel and do great

659
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:03,159
and times where they do mediocre maybe

660
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:04,750
they're overly busy maybe employees got

661
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:07,300
shifted around you know external

662
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:10,330
pressures what what not but every

663
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:11,440
organization is unique and and this

664
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:13,090
concept is little bit different from the

665
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,530
physical world a friend of mine is an

666
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:17,610
engineer and and we've talked about that

667
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:19,330
like he didn't understand why

668
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:21,310
information security doesn't have

669
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:22,570
licensing and certifications and all

670
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:24,399
this stuff just that's I mean we have

671
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:26,550
certs but it's not the same way that

672
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,350
engineers do right like in order to

673
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:30,970
assess this particular thing in this

674
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:32,439
particular type of building you have to

675
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:33,640
lie see license and go through those

676
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:38,440
process and you have to know all this

677
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:40,270
stuff the problem is you know my

678
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,260
engineer friend can look and he can say

679
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:43,030
you know what I know the tensile

680
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:44,980
strength of this material and the size

681
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:47,530
of this beam and I know the pull of

682
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:49,840
gravity and I know you know this can go

683
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:51,670
to this level and he can do the math and

684
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,189
that doesn't change every single

685
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:56,110
situation if he has the right data he

686
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:57,070
can make the decision and move on and be

687
00:25:56,110 --> 00:26:00,219
comfortable that he made the right

688
00:25:57,070 --> 00:26:01,840
decision the problem with security and

689
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,800
and this is part of the problem I think

690
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,449
we're always gonna have with the whole

691
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,760
licensing thing is that we have

692
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:08,590
intelligent adversaries right so the

693
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:10,629
people they're going after a particular

694
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:12,310
organization are going to vary their

695
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:15,010
tactics based on the security controls

696
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:16,510
based on the incentives based you know

697
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:17,770
whatever motivations they have might

698
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:19,750
have whether that's financial or

699
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:22,629
political or you know just making a name

700
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:24,220
for themselves and so from a security

701
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:25,720
perspective we have to defend against

702
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:28,060
these intelligent people differently

703
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,550
than we defend against a storm or

704
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:33,490
gravity or whatever and so it's critical

705
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:35,080
that we understand what are the issues

706
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:37,030
we in that organization what are the

707
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:40,120
security controls in place how do we

708
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:42,340
design testing to test those specific

709
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:44,330
security controls in this specific

710
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:46,480
environment and not just again

711
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:50,350
fall back on that cookie cutter service

712
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:53,809
when in doubt pull the wires absolutely

713
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:56,000
so I want to dive into some more

714
00:26:53,809 --> 00:26:57,289
specifics about pen tests and I'm gonna

715
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,730
talk about kind of I'm gonna break this

716
00:26:57,289 --> 00:27:00,289
down and talk about some some some of

717
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:01,700
the flaws that the businesses make on

718
00:27:00,289 --> 00:27:03,890
their side and then I'm gonna talk about

719
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:05,630
some of the flaws that pen testers make

720
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:09,559
and then some specific things you can do

721
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:11,029
to improve that oftentimes you know we

722
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:12,559
talked about goals early on and saying

723
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:13,940
what is the goal of this particular

724
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,620
control what is the goal of this pen

725
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:18,649
test why are we doing this sometimes

726
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:22,189
there's more than one but a lot of times

727
00:27:18,649 --> 00:27:24,860
businesses do things to kind of sabotage

728
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:26,899
themselves they they detract from the

729
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:28,850
from the goal often without even

730
00:27:26,899 --> 00:27:29,779
realizing it sometimes it's because they

731
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:31,668
just haven't thought through the goal

732
00:27:29,779 --> 00:27:32,720
right they don't know like we have to do

733
00:27:31,669 --> 00:27:34,490
a pen test because we do a pen test

734
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,840
every year or I was told to go do it but

735
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:37,610
but you know they haven't really thought

736
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,199
through what are we trying to get out of

737
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:41,779
this sometimes they don't have

738
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,820
experience you know they watch movies

739
00:27:41,779 --> 00:27:45,409
they've seen that they have that mental

740
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:46,610
idea of what the pen test looks like or

741
00:27:45,409 --> 00:27:49,010
maybe they've had bad experiences with

742
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:50,689
other other consulting companies but

743
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:52,039
they don't know what other options are

744
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:54,470
there and then sometimes you just have

745
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:55,908
internal politics we want to do this but

746
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:58,220
we can't do it because you know we can't

747
00:27:55,909 --> 00:28:00,260
get that person on board or whatever so

748
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:02,830
let's let's look at some specific types

749
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:04,850
of issues one of these is the black box

750
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:06,799
mentality the idea that you know what

751
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:08,269
you or the attacker I'm not going to

752
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:10,820
tell you anything you come in and try to

753
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:12,620
hack me we don't do any black box

754
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:15,620
testing when somebody comes and says hey

755
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:16,969
I want a black box test we'll either try

756
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:19,729
to talk them out of it or send them

757
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:21,649
somewhere else and the reason is it's

758
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:24,169
extremely expensive it's not very

759
00:28:21,649 --> 00:28:26,090
efficient and almost nobody is really

760
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:27,380
ready like organizations are ready for

761
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:28,730
that type of testing there are some

762
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:30,559
there are a very small number of

763
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:34,250
organizations that have the controls in

764
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:36,918
place and things set up well enough to

765
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:39,440
get some value from sort of a black box

766
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:44,210
mentality but for almost everybody else

767
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:46,700
there is so much more value in some form

768
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:49,669
of open back-and-forth providing some

769
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:51,260
some form of information we usually do

770
00:28:49,669 --> 00:28:53,570
what we call it gray box pen test some

771
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:55,940
people call it a more crystal box the

772
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:57,439
idea of if there's information that an

773
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:58,310
attacker is going to be able to gather

774
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,680
about you

775
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:04,040
whether it's you know scanning internal

776
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:05,840
space or you know hey we assume that

777
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:07,340
you're gonna get compromised right you

778
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,870
can take that assumption that you're

779
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:11,720
gonna get malware somewhere on the

780
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:13,429
internal network so one valid test is

781
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,290
saying ok let's assume this system got

782
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:16,460
compromised what can we do from there

783
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:18,710
right let's start with that machine

784
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:21,230
let's pick some times as we assume that

785
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:24,380
a user credential either from a

786
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:25,580
malicious user or a compromised system

787
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:27,200
or whatever those user credentials are

788
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:28,010
gonna make it compromised so let's go

789
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,900
from there

790
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:31,879
maybe it's you know we're gonna test the

791
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:33,530
outside of your network but an attacker

792
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:36,950
can scan the entire internet right

793
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:39,290
fyodor built that ability into nmap

794
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:41,090
years ago so there's nothing out there

795
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:42,530
that that's hidden necessarily so go

796
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:46,669
ahead and provide us everything this in

797
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:49,460
scope and let's test that this also goes

798
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:51,380
into who's involved in the test on the

799
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:54,860
on the client side

800
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:57,230
I like pen tests to be a what I call an

801
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:59,209
educational opportunity I want as many

802
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:01,280
people involved I want as many people as

803
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:03,020
possible involved so they know what's

804
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:05,360
happening they know how to watch their

805
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:06,860
logs they know hey this weird thing

806
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,540
happened with this system we had this

807
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:11,260
pen test going on maybe I should follow

808
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:14,899
up and see if this is related to that

809
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:16,760
yeah for I mentioned the backdoors and

810
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:18,080
breaches game from Black Hills John's

811
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:21,530
done a great job with that I love that

812
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:23,300
game definitely worth checking out

813
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:26,990
so anyways black box mentality let's

814
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:28,129
move on scoping issues PCI is the

815
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:29,480
biggest one there are so many people

816
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:30,800
especially when they're just checking

817
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,980
the box you know I've got to do this

818
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:35,210
compliance test very limited scope we

819
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:37,190
only want to test this thing

820
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:38,930
the problem is in reality attackers

821
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:41,510
don't just test this one thing right

822
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:44,060
attackers take a water

823
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:47,420
I'm sorry broader wide kind of swath

824
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:49,340
attack you need to be realistic and

825
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:52,190
understanding what are the potential

826
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:53,959
other areas of attack into the network

827
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:55,280
and a lot of times we have people come

828
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,810
back and like well we don't want to we

829
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,760
don't want to go into that because we

830
00:30:56,810 --> 00:31:01,669
don't have enough budget for you to test

831
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:03,230
all that and that may be the case but

832
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:05,450
that should be part of a scoping

833
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:09,080
conversation with the testers to say hey

834
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:10,190
is this really you know what would it

835
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,520
take to do this what would it take to

836
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:13,650
test this type of

837
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:15,000
or that type of situation sometimes it

838
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:16,520
doesn't cost as much as you think maybe

839
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,690
it doesn't take that much extra effort

840
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:21,870
there are other things you can do also

841
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:26,070
we've got a client who runs an airport

842
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:28,290
and for years they always said bet the

843
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:30,090
baggage baggage claim is off off limits

844
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:32,010
like nobody touches the baggage claim

845
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:35,970
you know people can set on the tarmac

846
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:37,590
for 10-15 minutes before they get off

847
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:39,630
the plane and it's normal it's accept

848
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:42,120
expected no big deal if you have to wait

849
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:45,060
for your baggage an extra thirty seconds

850
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:46,739
like people just come unglued and so you

851
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:48,960
know they're absolutely we can't test

852
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:50,340
that but through working with them over

853
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,930
the years and we start talking about

854
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:55,080
it's like you know what we can find ways

855
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:57,390
to test certain areas of scope in in a

856
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:59,879
safer format right we can we can say hey

857
00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:01,230
let's let's take this one section this

858
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,910
one baggage claim off and we're gonna

859
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:04,200
we're gonna do some scanning real light

860
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:06,090
at first and then start doing some

861
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,310
manual testing on just this one system

862
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:10,139
from like 3 to 6 a.m. and see what

863
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:12,690
happens and then if that goes well we'll

864
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:15,660
start expanding it and you can build out

865
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:17,880
tests to to deal with that type of scope

866
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:19,470
so don't ever think like hey I can't

867
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:22,580
touch all this other stuff because only

868
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:24,420
this one thing is in scope another issue

869
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:26,939
stakeholder participation I kind of

870
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:30,030
mentioned to that already I love it when

871
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:31,530
you know folks from DevOps and folks

872
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:34,290
from the networking team and the

873
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:36,090
sysadmin team and the security team you

874
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:37,560
know if they've got a sock when all of

875
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:39,570
those people are involved in the kickoff

876
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:41,610
call and all of those people are

877
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:43,460
involved in discussions and e-mails back

878
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:46,790
and forth during during a pen test

879
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:50,520
sometimes we set up like slack teams

880
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:52,560
with our customers and so we can go

881
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:54,389
through and have live communications

882
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:56,340
during this ask hey we're doing this did

883
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:57,810
you see this or hey we saw this did is

884
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:59,820
this from you guys oh no I didn't you

885
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:01,440
know we didn't see that what can we do

886
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,909
differently to improve our logins so

887
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,670
maybe we see that next time that sort of

888
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:08,190
thing ghost is mentioning red sea jet

889
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:10,710
tim-tim is awesome I don't know if he's

890
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:11,940
spoke here recently but definitely I'm a

891
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:13,890
big fan of red sea jazz well we keep

892
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:18,560
trying to hire him and he refuses but

893
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:21,540
one of these days maybe scheduling a

894
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:24,450
couple of things on scheduling don't

895
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:25,110
wait until December if you have to have

896
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:27,720
an annual pen

897
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:30,649
test do it early in the year I can't

898
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:33,120
tell you I mean once we hit really

899
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:35,520
september/october every pen test company

900
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,850
in the world is just slammed and we're

901
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:40,080
all booked way far in advance because

902
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:42,299
everybody all of a sudden realizes oh

903
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,620
crap the end of the year comes in

904
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:45,510
December this year I have to get my pen

905
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,110
test done like you know what's gonna

906
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:48,059
happen

907
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:50,040
plan ahead right I mean started doing

908
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:52,340
that kind of stuff in June July maybe

909
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:54,240
March or April or whatever it can be

910
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:55,770
courts moving that up and that's for a

911
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,000
couple of reasons one is you have all

912
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:58,410
the holidays you have all that kinda

913
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,929
stuff going on you have all the

914
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:02,970
companies that are booked and and

915
00:33:59,929 --> 00:34:05,340
struggling to find the right time their

916
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:06,990
employees also have holiday events and

917
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:08,549
activities and vacations and stuff like

918
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:10,530
that going on it's just a lot more

919
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:12,570
pressure we try to not make our

920
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:13,919
consultants be booked 100% of the time

921
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:17,970
right it's like any job you want to have

922
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:20,219
some downtime to do other stuff so if if

923
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:22,138
this people doing your tests are going

924
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:24,299
back to back to back to back pen tests

925
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:26,639
you're probably not going to get as much

926
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,990
value from yours because they're already

927
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,190
kind of moving on to the next one or

928
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:31,859
they're trying to finished up stuff from

929
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:33,720
the last one so definitely if you can do

930
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:36,480
it earlier the better don't go on

931
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:38,339
vacation during the test especially if

932
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,929
you're like a critical component or

933
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:41,100
right before and expect that

934
00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:43,710
everything's gonna be ready to go when

935
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:45,480
you get back I have to say that because

936
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:47,820
people have done that people do that and

937
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,290
it's so frustrating when you know you're

938
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:51,810
spending a lot of money to get a good

939
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:54,389
test we want to make it as effective as

940
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:56,460
possible and then you're on vacation the

941
00:34:54,389 --> 00:35:01,170
week before and we can't get any of the

942
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:02,760
the preliminary stuff set up when there

943
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:05,160
isn't a worldwide pandemic we try to

944
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:06,720
schedule for q1 or media q2 q4 that's

945
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:09,060
that's awesome I'll tell you Hugh one is

946
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,040
normally really really slow for most pen

947
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:12,600
test companies and it's just because q4

948
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:15,359
is so slammed and then all of a sudden

949
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:16,680
it kind of lets off but yeah it's

950
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:18,900
definitely some budgeting planning it's

951
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:21,060
got to happen there make sure your

952
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:23,220
people are available don't schedule a

953
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:26,520
test and then find out like hey you know

954
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:27,810
some of your critical folks are not not

955
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:30,330
around not available make sure that's

956
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:32,250
there and then the other is I am NOT a

957
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:35,240
fan of after-hours testing there there

958
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:38,790
are times when after-hours testing is

959
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:40,770
necessary leanin it's necessary

960
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:43,200
there are times where maybe I understand

961
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:45,960
that why it's done here's the thing

962
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,520
here's what happens when you come to me

963
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,720
during regular business hours in the

964
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,040
middle of a pen test and you said hey

965
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:53,459
this thing just broke or there's this

966
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:54,660
issue going on what'd you do and I can

967
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:56,070
look and say okay when did it start I

968
00:35:54,660 --> 00:36:00,149
can tell you exactly what I did in the

969
00:35:56,070 --> 00:36:01,980
last hour when you wake me up at 9:00

970
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:04,710
a.m. because I stayed up all night and

971
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:05,760
and at 9:00 a.m. your folks start coming

972
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:06,810
into the office and they discover

973
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,940
something's down or something's not

974
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:10,170
working and you call me and say hey we

975
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:12,450
just found out this thing what you do

976
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:14,220
and I'm saying I'm first off I'm groggy

977
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:15,569
because I just went to bed and I have no

978
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,919
idea what you're talking about and then

979
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:18,300
I said okay you want to know what I did

980
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:21,060
in the last eight hours that might have

981
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:23,550
caused that thing I don't know right so

982
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:25,710
it it's just harder and then if

983
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:27,540
something does go down now I have to

984
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:29,480
call your people and say hey we were

985
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:31,740
doing this test and it quit responding

986
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,670
we need somebody to wake up and figure

987
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:34,649
out what's going on and get it back

988
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:36,090
online there's just there's so many

989
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:37,680
reasons that that doesn't go well the

990
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:40,980
other side of it is especially on

991
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:44,339
network testing after hours in an office

992
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:46,350
doesn't doesn't really simulate

993
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:47,520
real-world activity right you don't have

994
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:49,230
people on the network you don't have

995
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,610
people interacting with systems the

996
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:52,710
loads on systems are different so

997
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:54,150
there's so many different things a lot

998
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:56,100
of systems you know different controls

999
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:59,550
and things are modified at the evening

1000
00:36:56,100 --> 00:37:02,580
so that after hours you know end of day

1001
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:04,680
type routines and stuff can run so all

1002
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:06,840
that to say I'm really not a fan of

1003
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:08,040
after-hours testing we actually we

1004
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,480
started doing a thing we charge 10%

1005
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:12,840
extra if you're gonna do an after-hours

1006
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:14,120
test we charge 10% extra and that that

1007
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:16,290
amount goes straight to the consultant

1008
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:17,790
that's just a kind of a bonus of like

1009
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:20,279
hey it sucks you have to stay up late so

1010
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:23,430
you know here's an extra little little

1011
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:27,030
bonus and then the last thing is just

1012
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:28,649
preparation make sure that everything

1013
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:30,090
that the testers need you know all the

1014
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:31,710
stuff that you've agreed to up front on

1015
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:33,030
the scope make sure that you've planned

1016
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:34,680
that out and you have it ready to go

1017
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:36,630
they shouldn't have to be you know

1018
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:38,160
Monday morning they're ready to jump in

1019
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:40,740
and all upset and you don't have the VPN

1020
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,480
setup or you don't have you know the box

1021
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:44,459
turned on or their credentials aren't

1022
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,460
valid or whatever like have that stuff

1023
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:50,340
be prepared so that you know the tests

1024
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:51,630
go smoothly so let's talk a little bit

1025
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,710
about some of the common flaws that pen

1026
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:57,150
testers make

1027
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:59,099
is it quieter doing after-hours yes it's

1028
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:02,549
absolutely quieter on the network fewer

1029
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:04,859
people what not personally I kind of

1030
00:38:02,549 --> 00:38:06,359
like after-hours tests because nobody

1031
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:09,240
else is around right Twitter is quiet

1032
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:11,880
slack is quiet at Facebook's quiet like

1033
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:15,089
I can focus but I don't think it's the

1034
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,510
right value for the customers most of

1035
00:38:15,089 --> 00:38:17,160
the time

1036
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:19,799
definitely it's all about talking about

1037
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:21,240
the telescope so I had to throw the free

1038
00:38:19,799 --> 00:38:22,710
Kevin stickers in there I tried to find

1039
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:27,720
one that said put Kevin back but I could

1040
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:29,940
find that the so some common mistakes

1041
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:31,799
with with pen testing the whole bait and

1042
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:33,569
switch thing a lot of people have been

1043
00:38:31,799 --> 00:38:35,880
through that you you get on a call and

1044
00:38:33,569 --> 00:38:37,799
you have a conversation and scope out

1045
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:41,010
the test and you're you know you think

1046
00:38:37,799 --> 00:38:42,960
you're getting you know this amazing

1047
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:43,559
attacker you know the a-team and it's

1048
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,380
gonna be great

1049
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:48,539
and then when the actual test starts you

1050
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:50,609
never hear from those 18 guys again all

1051
00:38:48,539 --> 00:38:53,130
you get is you know the JV who basically

1052
00:38:50,609 --> 00:38:54,509
know how to run necess you know that's a

1053
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:55,559
that's a big thing that we got to watch

1054
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:57,270
out for

1055
00:38:55,559 --> 00:38:58,799
that I talked about earlier like if

1056
00:38:57,270 --> 00:39:00,779
you're on the defensive side like making

1057
00:38:58,799 --> 00:39:03,240
sure that hey you have those resumes or

1058
00:39:00,779 --> 00:39:04,500
at least a bio that you understand who's

1059
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,180
actually going to be doing the test and

1060
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,609
don't be afraid to ask just say hey is

1061
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:10,470
this guy really competent is he capable

1062
00:39:07,609 --> 00:39:15,089
and you know it's got a very company

1063
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:18,779
about company obviously over-reliance on

1064
00:39:15,089 --> 00:39:20,369
automated tools so a good tester should

1065
00:39:18,779 --> 00:39:22,730
be able to use automated tools and

1066
00:39:20,369 --> 00:39:25,140
manual testing in a coordinated fashion

1067
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:27,240
the question that I always have for an

1068
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:29,788
automated tool is what value does it

1069
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:32,098
bring what you know go back to our goals

1070
00:39:29,789 --> 00:39:34,230
what our goals and how does this

1071
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:36,390
automated tool help us meet those goals

1072
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:38,549
the same thing should be applied to

1073
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:40,799
manual testing what value do you bring

1074
00:39:38,549 --> 00:39:43,890
as the tester what are you providing

1075
00:39:40,799 --> 00:39:46,380
from a manual perspective if your test

1076
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:47,940
is I clicked the Run button on the

1077
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:50,640
necess can and then I handed you the

1078
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:52,140
report you didn't bring any value you

1079
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:56,190
are worthless you can be replaced by a

1080
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:57,690
small little small shell script so think

1081
00:39:56,190 --> 00:40:01,740
through that don't be don't be too

1082
00:39:57,690 --> 00:40:04,230
reliant on automated stuff often there's

1083
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:06,000
an issue with kind of having that focus

1084
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:06,570
of I had this checklist and I'm gonna go

1085
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,820
through and do my

1086
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:10,950
on this checklist and that's it there is

1087
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:12,210
value in checklist or I like to we use

1088
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:14,220
playbooks you know we've gone through

1089
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:15,870
and said okay here's some specific types

1090
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:17,279
of things that we always test on these

1091
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:19,620
types of networks or these types of web

1092
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,720
apps yeah someone else could push that

1093
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:23,940
button somebody much cheaper than you

1094
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:25,740
could push that button I like the idea

1095
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:27,870
of play books to help you remember to do

1096
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:30,450
different things and whatnot the danger

1097
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:32,400
with a checklist is it very much becomes

1098
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:33,839
a I go through I do this I do this I do

1099
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,420
this I do this I move on to the next

1100
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:38,400
thing and you never stop and think about

1101
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:40,470
okay wait let me think about this

1102
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,360
particular environment these particular

1103
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:44,609
systems these particular whatever let me

1104
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:46,080
figure out how they you know maybe some

1105
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:48,180
other types of attacks that I wouldn't

1106
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:52,200
normally try but but they might work

1107
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:53,490
here so be careful with that are you

1108
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,230
saying we shouldn't hire at pentester on

1109
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:56,669
Fiverr that's a great idea you know I've

1110
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:58,470
never tried to offer services on Fiverr

1111
00:40:56,670 --> 00:41:00,360
actually don't think I can I don't think

1112
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:01,980
I'm allowed to but I don't know maybe

1113
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,540
secure ideas can do that as a company

1114
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:07,650
that would be kind of cool for five

1115
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:09,630
dollars you get a pen test but for

1116
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:10,890
another five thousand and five dollars

1117
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:13,590
you get I don't know whatever I don't

1118
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:18,629
know how fiber works out well um tunnel

1119
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:20,130
vision the way someone said because pen

1120
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:21,330
testing are so broad are their pen test

1121
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:23,340
members who specialize in only two or

1122
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:24,360
four main areas who are called on or do

1123
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:28,380
you have to be a jack-of-all-trades

1124
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:29,580
that's a great question Carl so we

1125
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:32,010
generally hire people who have

1126
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:35,430
experience in certain areas we try not

1127
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:36,750
to hire just and I'm relying on my own

1128
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:41,700
experience here that this isn't the same

1129
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:43,200
for everybody but the we don't hire

1130
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,339
people who are just security that just

1131
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,660
went to school for security or that's

1132
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:48,480
all they've done with their life we we

1133
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:50,040
look for senior level developers or know

1134
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,050
where people or sis admins people that

1135
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:54,960
know what it means to to carry a pager

1136
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:56,400
at night and have to put everything on

1137
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,260
hold if the system goes down like we

1138
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:01,880
want people with real business you know

1139
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:03,930
real world experience with that said I

1140
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:05,640
have a lot of experience on the

1141
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:08,129
networking side and a little bit on the

1142
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:09,660
sysadmin side and I did some development

1143
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:12,060
stuff back in the day

1144
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:14,490
we've got other guys who were hardcore

1145
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:17,220
developers and and really know that well

1146
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:19,919
so when we schedule we try to kind of

1147
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:20,520
combine those now I can I can do web app

1148
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,040
testing

1149
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,810
you know really well it's not my forte I

1150
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,580
would not say like I am the best web app

1151
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:28,380
tester out there but I can do a really

1152
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:30,299
good job same with like the guys that

1153
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:31,800
have the former dev experience like they

1154
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,510
can jump in they can do a great job

1155
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,460
networking so just because someone

1156
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:38,670
doesn't have direct experience doesn't

1157
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:40,290
mean they're not capable but you do I

1158
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:41,760
think you do need to have that kind of

1159
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:45,750
jack-of-all-trades you need to have the

1160
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:51,000
ability to understand a wide range of of

1161
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:53,300
different technologies and tool sets so

1162
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,620
the tunnel vision let me jump into that

1163
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:57,450
be careful about getting stuck on a

1164
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:59,100
particular thing right especially like

1165
00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:00,960
this this happens a lot after you get

1166
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:03,420
domain admin maybe you compromised the

1167
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,550
system and you get here and then you

1168
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:07,770
just you're so focused in on this one

1169
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:09,120
particular area that you kind of forget

1170
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:10,530
about everything else right you don't go

1171
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:12,900
look at other issues or you don't scan

1172
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:18,840
other networks or other systems the

1173
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:23,940
problem with this is that hold on one

1174
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:26,520
second all right

1175
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:30,630
so I was still in the discord channel a

1176
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:32,220
lot of you over so you got to step back

1177
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:33,900
and say okay yeah we found this once

1178
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:35,310
this one issues a lot of skill domain

1179
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:37,110
admin there and we're gonna pivot what

1180
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:39,630
not but we also want to spend some time

1181
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:43,140
expanding out and looking at other areas

1182
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:44,550
and try to find as much as many areas

1183
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:45,750
that present risk to the organization as

1184
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:46,890
possible it's not an audit we're not

1185
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:48,630
gonna cover everything we're not gonna

1186
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:50,370
scan in every single system necessarily

1187
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:52,050
but we want to try to provide as much

1188
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:54,810
value to the organization as possible

1189
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:56,870
and then the last thing on here is be

1190
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:59,009
careful with the the spray-and-pray

1191
00:43:56,870 --> 00:44:00,630
concept the idea of you know what I'm

1192
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:01,980
just gonna I know they've got these

1193
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:03,840
vulnerable systems I'm gonna send this

1194
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:05,940
out against all of them

1195
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:08,160
I don't know how many people remember DB

1196
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:11,730
Auto pone from Metasploit right you just

1197
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:14,100
it was basically a module that would be

1198
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:17,010
used in map to scan an organization or a

1199
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:18,990
network and then every port that was

1200
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:20,970
listed on every host it would try to use

1201
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:22,890
every Metasploit module that it could

1202
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:25,020
possibly work against that port or that

1203
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:27,690
service and it was a great way to get a

1204
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:29,970
lot of shells but it tended to crash a

1205
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:31,290
lot of things in the process I remember

1206
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:32,279
I remember seeing a tweet somewhere and

1207
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:33,540
I couldn't find it I tried to find it

1208
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,390
for this but like somebody showed a

1209
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:37,299
tweet where they had

1210
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:39,069
a thousand or two thousand shells from I

1211
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:41,410
don't member if it was para shuttle

1212
00:44:39,069 --> 00:44:42,849
Empire or you know cobalt strike or some

1213
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:44,140
like that but they had like this you

1214
00:44:42,849 --> 00:44:45,730
know they were showing like hey look how

1215
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:46,890
awesome I am I got all these shells and

1216
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:49,539
I'm just sitting there looking I'm like

1217
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:51,190
what's the point why why did why do you

1218
00:44:49,539 --> 00:44:52,869
need that I don't get that that's that's

1219
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:54,549
stupid yeah let's bring everything down

1220
00:44:52,869 --> 00:44:56,410
all that's gonna do is cause problems

1221
00:44:54,549 --> 00:44:57,490
for the for that for the organization

1222
00:44:56,410 --> 00:45:01,390
it's not really going to help you

1223
00:44:57,490 --> 00:45:03,549
demonstrate anything and then lack of

1224
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:05,890
communication obviously that's a big one

1225
00:45:03,549 --> 00:45:07,299
I love organizations that want to

1226
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:09,009
communicate back and forth and have

1227
00:45:07,299 --> 00:45:11,259
those conversations and and really talk

1228
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:12,519
about okay we found this thing you know

1229
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:14,109
we had this security control in place

1230
00:45:12,519 --> 00:45:18,459
what if we tried this instead what if we

1231
00:45:14,109 --> 00:45:20,078
do that um last thing here I just but

1232
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:22,809
kind of wrapping it up towards the end

1233
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:25,839
what is the most single important part

1234
00:45:22,809 --> 00:45:26,890
of a test I'll throw that out there I

1235
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:29,349
know this little bit of a delay but does

1236
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:32,828
anybody have an idea the most important

1237
00:45:29,349 --> 00:45:39,789
part of every pen test want to take a

1238
00:45:32,829 --> 00:45:42,940
drink I need some jeopardy music I'm not

1239
00:45:39,789 --> 00:45:44,529
gonna sing though the report winner

1240
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:47,980
winner ROI that's good too

1241
00:45:44,529 --> 00:45:51,700
the report is the most important part

1242
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:53,799
after two weeks and thirty grand at the

1243
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:56,288
end of the day what the client has left

1244
00:45:53,799 --> 00:45:59,619
is a piece of paper and hopefully some

1245
00:45:56,289 --> 00:46:00,880
good memories so I want to talk just a

1246
00:45:59,619 --> 00:46:03,099
little bit briefly here at the very end

1247
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,319
about what things should be in a report

1248
00:46:03,099 --> 00:46:07,269
and every company's report is gonna be a

1249
00:46:05,319 --> 00:46:08,769
little bit different if you get a report

1250
00:46:07,269 --> 00:46:10,569
back from a pen test company and it's a

1251
00:46:08,769 --> 00:46:13,000
necessary part with a different header

1252
00:46:10,569 --> 00:46:15,279
on it fire them that's absurd that

1253
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,680
should never happen every report should

1254
00:46:15,279 --> 00:46:19,089
have an executive summary in my mind the

1255
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:21,578
executive summary should never be more

1256
00:46:19,089 --> 00:46:24,160
than maybe two pages I always try to

1257
00:46:21,579 --> 00:46:25,930
make it one page and what I what I try

1258
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:29,618
to the perspective that I read an

1259
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:31,960
executive summary is I want a CEO or a

1260
00:46:29,619 --> 00:46:33,309
CFO or CTO whatever I want somebody that

1261
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,779
maybe doesn't have a lot of technical

1262
00:46:33,309 --> 00:46:36,819
experience they're more on the

1263
00:46:34,779 --> 00:46:39,609
management side I want them at a very

1264
00:46:36,819 --> 00:46:42,910
high level to say within two paragraphs

1265
00:46:39,609 --> 00:46:45,130
I know the key critical things that we

1266
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:46,240
need to deal with like like maybe I

1267
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:48,039
don't understand the technical side of

1268
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,399
it but I understand why these aren't

1269
00:46:48,039 --> 00:46:50,109
poor

1270
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:53,049
and and what we need to do to address

1271
00:46:50,109 --> 00:46:54,490
this so that should be the goal the

1272
00:46:53,049 --> 00:46:57,520
scope obviously what was included in

1273
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:58,899
what's not I really like that narrative

1274
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,700
we've started doing that several years

1275
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:02,289
ago some companies don't do it but the

1276
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:03,879
narrative is just the idea of like I'm

1277
00:47:02,289 --> 00:47:05,890
gonna give you a kind of a walkthrough

1278
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:08,109
of the test right it's a first-person

1279
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:09,339
like we did this and we found this and

1280
00:47:08,109 --> 00:47:11,170
we did that we tried this but that

1281
00:47:09,339 --> 00:47:17,109
didn't work we did this walking through

1282
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:18,279
that process the oh gosh somebody said

1283
00:47:17,109 --> 00:47:19,240
I've been given the report for another

1284
00:47:18,279 --> 00:47:21,880
customer oops

1285
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:23,589
oh man yeah I can see how that happens

1286
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:26,410
I'm not sure we've ever done that

1287
00:47:23,589 --> 00:47:28,450
hopefully not but yeah that would be bad

1288
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:31,750
I hope you're not a customer honestly

1289
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:33,368
I've no idea then and then the last

1290
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:34,869
thing and this is might be the most

1291
00:47:33,369 --> 00:47:36,849
important compared to the executive

1292
00:47:34,869 --> 00:47:39,220
summary somewhere in there is the idea

1293
00:47:36,849 --> 00:47:41,529
of specific findings these are specific

1294
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:44,950
things that present risk to the

1295
00:47:41,529 --> 00:47:48,039
organization and then recommendations on

1296
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:49,598
how those should be fixed so going back

1297
00:47:48,039 --> 00:47:50,710
all the way back to the goals what we

1298
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:52,329
talked about from the beginning what are

1299
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:53,819
the goals of this what what types of

1300
00:47:52,329 --> 00:47:57,099
business risks are we trying to analyze

1301
00:47:53,819 --> 00:47:59,200
that report when you finish it up and

1302
00:47:57,099 --> 00:48:01,299
hand it off that report should meet

1303
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,558
those goals it should allow that that

1304
00:48:01,299 --> 00:48:05,140
organization to say okay here are

1305
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:06,940
specific risks this gives us some

1306
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:09,578
quantifiable information on those and

1307
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:12,789
then we can decide okay it's gonna cost

1308
00:48:09,579 --> 00:48:14,710
these resources to fix this risk or we

1309
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:17,700
can accept that risk or put in some

1310
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:19,990
other mitigation or whatever that may be

1311
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:22,299
somebody asked thoughts on a three-month

1312
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:25,750
rescan to show value with appended

1313
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:27,309
improve rating if applicable that can be

1314
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:29,260
done we do that kind of stuff for some

1315
00:48:27,309 --> 00:48:32,049
test customers sometimes we come back

1316
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:32,859
and retest you know after they fixed

1317
00:48:32,049 --> 00:48:35,650
certain issues

1318
00:48:32,859 --> 00:48:37,150
honestly in in my mind you shouldn't

1319
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:40,510
need your pen test company to come back

1320
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:42,640
into a rescan right we don't normally

1321
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:44,380
necessarily provide hold on I think I

1322
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:46,509
had down there nessus results right we

1323
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:48,190
don't necessarily always provide

1324
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:49,990
scanning data unless the customer asks

1325
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:51,160
if it's useful to them in some way or if

1326
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:52,990
we can provide it in a format that will

1327
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:54,759
be useful will absolutely provide that

1328
00:48:52,990 --> 00:48:56,890
but honestly if you're not doing

1329
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:58,119
vulnerability scanning you probably

1330
00:48:56,890 --> 00:49:00,848
weren't ready for a pen test yourself

1331
00:48:58,119 --> 00:49:02,200
anyway so you shouldn't need a third

1332
00:49:00,849 --> 00:49:04,270
party to come back and do

1333
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:05,379
rescanning every three months that

1334
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:07,509
should just be part of yours and if

1335
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:09,340
honestly if you're if you don't know how

1336
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:10,540
to do that or you can't do that hire

1337
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:12,550
consultant to help you set up

1338
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:14,050
vulnerability scanning and do that first

1339
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:15,910
and start mitigating those issues and

1340
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:18,070
then you might be ready for a pen test

1341
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:20,560
that's a totally different talking talk

1342
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:21,880
though Tony do you document all the

1343
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:23,410
things that didn't get you anywhere and

1344
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:25,720
what happens if you have no significant

1345
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:27,370
findings um we don't always document all

1346
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:29,410
the things that didn't get anywhere but

1347
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:31,299
but a lot of times we talk on on some of

1348
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:34,870
them especially if there's particular

1349
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:36,730
relevance I always like to point out the

1350
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:39,370
good things that work on an organization

1351
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:40,990
what they've done really well and so if

1352
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:42,880
we tried something and it didn't work

1353
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:45,220
because of a certain control I

1354
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:47,260
absolutely want to call that out and you

1355
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:49,480
know kind of congratulate them you know

1356
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:52,380
hey you put resources into this it's

1357
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:52,380
good good job

1358
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:56,830
Nathan when selecting a vendor for pen

1359
00:49:55,060 --> 00:50:00,460
test our product what points should we

1360
00:49:56,830 --> 00:50:01,750
keep in mind that's actually a bigger

1361
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:04,420
discussion I don't necessarily have time

1362
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:09,670
for but we can maybe I'll come back to

1363
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:11,680
that in in the conversation there yeah

1364
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:13,390
so a couple of final just considerations

1365
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,560
things to think about what are the crown

1366
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:16,180
jewels I kind of mentioned that already

1367
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:19,120
what are other potential revenue

1368
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:21,970
impactors offer solutions not just

1369
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:23,230
problems right the the goal of security

1370
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:25,180
should be to make things better we've

1371
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:27,070
got to move away from saying no you

1372
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:29,919
can't do that and move forward saying

1373
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:31,570
here's how we do that as security folks

1374
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,910
that should be our goal is to offer

1375
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:36,010
business solutions to do things that

1376
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:37,410
minimize risk not just saying you can't

1377
00:50:36,010 --> 00:50:39,400
do that because I don't like it

1378
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:40,420
testing alternatives there's different

1379
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,380
types of things you know I mentioned

1380
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:42,400
that if you're not doing regular

1381
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:44,550
vulnerability scanning you're probably

1382
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:46,600
not ready for a pen test you can do

1383
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:48,130
cooperative reviews we call it like an

1384
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:50,200
architecture review where we sit down

1385
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:51,880
and do sort of an interview process with

1386
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:53,410
your people and look at information and

1387
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:56,080
documentation and policies and

1388
00:50:53,410 --> 00:50:57,370
procedures or like coordinated

1389
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:59,470
simulations where we say hey we want to

1390
00:50:57,370 --> 00:51:01,000
test this control so we're going to set

1391
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:02,770
up a particular scenario and give you

1392
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,560
access to this system and simulate this

1393
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:07,000
user doing this type of thing you can do

1394
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:08,830
a lot and there's a wide range of stuff

1395
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:12,780
that's maybe not technically a pen test

1396
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:12,779
but some other ways of doing that

1397
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:16,230
I'll take another question or two here

1398
00:51:14,850 --> 00:51:17,400
and then I'm gonna have to wrap it up do

1399
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:18,720
you find that the client often is

1400
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:20,160
searching for a green light pen test

1401
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,810
company that will check off their

1402
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,799
compliance requirement and learn to

1403
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:24,690
change anything what's your advice for

1404
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:27,150
those companies and pretend pen testers

1405
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:29,130
who run into those companies we can do

1406
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:30,690
everybody runs into those sometimes I

1407
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:33,330
mean we've got a couple of clients that

1408
00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:34,470
literally every year we could just give

1409
00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:35,460
them last year's report and change the

1410
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:36,540
date because we know they're not gonna

1411
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:38,940
do anything

1412
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:41,490
we fired companies like that before like

1413
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:42,930
we fired customers because it's like

1414
00:51:41,490 --> 00:51:44,910
they're you're not getting any value

1415
00:51:42,930 --> 00:51:46,080
from this this is pointless we don't

1416
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:51,240
want to do this work go find somebody

1417
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:52,440
else so you can check that box I'm a pen

1418
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:54,209
tester friend who says it's his job to

1419
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:56,160
diplomatically tell people their babies

1420
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:58,290
are ugly yeah yeah my boss used to say

1421
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,730
it's a great job we get to slap people

1422
00:51:58,290 --> 00:52:01,320
around and tell them they suck and then

1423
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:02,370
they pay us and say thank you come back

1424
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:04,260
next year

1425
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:05,640
you know it's like any job there's some

1426
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:08,400
really awesome parts and then you spend

1427
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:10,500
hours and hours writing reports so many

1428
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:12,410
ways I think I've done time wise I will

1429
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:14,130
hang out in the chat for a little bit I

1430
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:14,879
appreciate all the feedback you guys

1431
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:17,370
have made this awesome

1432
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:19,200
and and hopefully you got some value so

1433
00:52:17,370 --> 00:52:21,180
last thing if you want to reach out to

1434
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,919
me at Swaney on twitter I've got a great

1435
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:24,720
story about how I confiscated that

1436
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:27,810
twitter handle from a neo-nazi I should

1437
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:30,419
tell sometime or via email you can reach

1438
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:31,380
me there so yeah and I'll provide slides

1439
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:32,640
somewhere I don't know if there's a

1440
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:34,950
formal way we're doing that but I'll

1441
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:37,940
definitely make the slides available so

1442
00:52:34,950 --> 00:52:37,939
awesome thanks everybody
