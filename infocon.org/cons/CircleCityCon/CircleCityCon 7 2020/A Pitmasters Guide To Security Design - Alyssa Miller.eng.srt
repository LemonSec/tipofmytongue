00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,390
hello everyone I would like to introduce

2
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:11,920
a listen

3
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:14,140
Miller with her talk

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:19,150
on a pitmasters guide to the security

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:22,540
design alright well thank you so much

6
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:24,040
and welcome to Circle City con hey

7
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:27,549
everybody

8
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:31,329
boy when I was asked to to give a

9
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:34,060
keynote today I you know who could have

10
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:36,220
imagined we'd be doing it from my office

11
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:38,980
here and you all would be out there in

12
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:41,350
cyberspace miss being able to see all

13
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:44,230
your lovely faces I miss my InfoSec fan

14
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:46,510
but hey we're still here we're doing it

15
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:49,390
this is all about the apocalypse and I

16
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:52,120
guess what what could be more fitting

17
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:55,059
than doing a keynote from you know my

18
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,589
little bunker here in Wisconsin so great

19
00:00:55,059 --> 00:00:59,739
to have you all aboard

20
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:02,590
so this is where I usually like to ask

21
00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:04,449
the question but you guys are gonna be

22
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:07,030
able to respond but I want to ask you to

23
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:09,520
anyway think about this for a minute

24
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:12,490
your favorite food sounds like a pretty

25
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,520
common simple question but what is that

26
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:18,130
one food that when you see it the the

27
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:22,798
drool just starts running from your

28
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:25,600
mouth for me it's brisket I am all about

29
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,240
the brisket I am all about barbecue in

30
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,210
general you know but I haven't always

31
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,829
been and I remember way back when I

32
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:34,179
first discovered barbecue you know I

33
00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:35,979
come from Wisconsin I've lived here all

34
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:39,790
my life barbecue up here is not real

35
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:41,439
barbecue so it wasn't until my adult

36
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:46,299
life that actually discovered I love

37
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:47,559
barbecue and so after finding out that

38
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:49,960
gee you know what this brisket thing is

39
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,909
amazing I I need more of this I ran out

40
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:55,360
I got myself a smoker not the one you

41
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:57,640
see here but you know I bought myself my

42
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,380
first smoker read up got all this stuff

43
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,170
got all really excited bought a brisket

44
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:04,390
and I was gonna make a brisket and so

45
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:06,880
you know I spent hours and hours with

46
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,949
that brisket on the smoker tending the

47
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,460
fire adding wood chips doing all the

48
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:15,040
things you do and when it came off I was

49
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:17,770
all excited I cut into it sliced it up

50
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,900
and that first bite was probably the

51
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:22,660
most disappointing thing I could have

52
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:25,280
imagined it was not the brisket that I

53
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:27,290
was hoping for now

54
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,330
you know years and years and years more

55
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:31,250
than a decade later I've gotten pretty

56
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:33,319
damn good at it and the smoker you see

57
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,090
there in the image is the one that's all

58
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,380
back on my patio right now it's where

59
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:40,160
all the magic happens

60
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:42,680
but later on I was talking to a an

61
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:47,120
executive leader in an organization as

62
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:48,319
part of a consulting gig and you know he

63
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,840
was talking about how they've gone

64
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:54,339
through all this effort they just

65
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:58,730
completed a few major initiatives and

66
00:02:54,340 --> 00:03:00,470
they got breached and it reminded me and

67
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:02,329
I brought it up to him at the time as a

68
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:04,070
metaphor like it was just like that

69
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:07,640
barbecue I spent all those hours and

70
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:10,609
hours and hours on barbecue smoking that

71
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:12,619
meat and it in the end I still didn't

72
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:14,510
get the result I wanted it's the same

73
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:17,239
thing in security it's what we struggle

74
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:19,790
with and so I got to thinking boy

75
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:22,880
there's a lot of lessons to be learned

76
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:26,079
from what we do in making a great

77
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:29,390
brisket that also teach us a lot about

78
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,829
security but let's say look first I just

79
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:32,619
want to talk a little bit about the

80
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:35,180
current state of affairs and security

81
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:37,220
there's no doubt I think we're all

82
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,810
familiar with the breach trends from

83
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:41,299
last year in particular that have

84
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:43,070
continued on into early 2020 they don't

85
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:44,690
they don't get a lot of press right now

86
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:49,310
everybody's worried about Kovan we're

87
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:51,380
worried about you know the Equality

88
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:52,610
issues going on and and protests and

89
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,680
things everything that's happening in

90
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:56,120
our world the world there's so much

91
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,859
going on that we've kind of forgotten

92
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,290
about these breaches but they're still

93
00:03:57,859 --> 00:04:03,799
happening and we're still seeing some of

94
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:07,280
the same themes s3 buckets or cloud

95
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:10,700
buckets in general now that are exposed

96
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:14,510
publicly and being breached containing

97
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:17,930
large amounts of private data container

98
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:19,880
images that are vulnerable as the the

99
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:23,570
headline says ha you know hackers love

100
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:25,520
docker because you've now got developers

101
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:28,940
who are launching container images that

102
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,440
contain vulnerabilities and the folks on

103
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:32,270
the security and the ops side they're

104
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,409
they're not able to really keep up with

105
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,490
what's getting launched there and make

106
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:37,370
sure that they're able to keep those

107
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:39,120
environments secure and of course the

108
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:42,419
ongoing Internet of

109
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,190
crash everything that we can connect to

110
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:47,250
the internet we're connecting to the

111
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:48,810
Internet I posted a blog post you know

112
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,330
towards the end of last year about a

113
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:53,120
curling iron that was now internet

114
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:55,979
enabled and I just can't fathom why

115
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:59,130
there was also something about a candle

116
00:04:55,979 --> 00:05:03,150
that you could automatically light with

117
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:06,270
your phone and I struggle to understand

118
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:08,609
why that's a thing we need either but

119
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:11,099
this is the reality of the world we live

120
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:13,770
in so if we dig a little deeper into

121
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,990
this last year in working for a former

122
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:17,789
employer I did some research we we had I

123
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:19,350
was part of their penetration testing

124
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:20,849
arm and so we looked at the

125
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:23,160
vulnerabilities we were finding through

126
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:25,320
our pen tests and what we discovered no

127
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,820
surprise in the context of these s3

128
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:29,370
buckets that keep getting preached is

129
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:31,349
that 40% of the vulnerabilities we were

130
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,930
finding were related to configuration

131
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:36,300
issues just like that things were there

132
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:39,270
was an easy fix but they were things

133
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:42,060
that were just getting mixed so we

134
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:46,080
looked back I said well okay if this is

135
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:48,510
where we're at in q4 of 2019 what was it

136
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,260
like three years ago and what how has

137
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:51,530
this changed

138
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:54,330
well what's scary is it didn't change

139
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:56,138
over the course of those last three

140
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:59,620
years

141
00:05:56,139 --> 00:06:01,659
it was the same story it was almost a

142
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,430
flatline in fact you can see I drew in a

143
00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:06,009
trend line there the trend line is flat

144
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:07,810
forty percent forty percent of those

145
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:10,569
vulnerabilities consistently our

146
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:12,939
configuration management issues that's

147
00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:14,289
not changing it's no wonder that moving

148
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,610
to cloud environments we have the same

149
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:18,969
issues that we've seen in on-prem

150
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:21,909
environments but what about those docker

151
00:06:18,969 --> 00:06:23,439
images we have docker hub with their

152
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:25,150
official images I should be able to pull

153
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:28,539
an image it should be secure right I

154
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:30,279
read that on a blog from a developer not

155
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:32,590
too long ago yeah go grab the the

156
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:35,319
official image it should be secure well

157
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:37,719
oh my god if you're using node and you

158
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:39,639
grab that node image from docker be

159
00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:42,159
ready six hundred and forty two

160
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:43,659
vulnerabilities that exist in that

161
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:45,639
single image

162
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:48,219
if you grab node latest from docker

163
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:50,439
that's what you're getting and you can

164
00:06:48,219 --> 00:06:54,460
see the others here Postgres nginx my

165
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:56,529
sequel all of them significant numbers

166
00:06:54,460 --> 00:07:00,099
of vulnerabilities that exist in these

167
00:06:56,529 --> 00:07:01,449
official images Ubuntu is the only one

168
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:04,389
that looks kind of positive like last

169
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:06,099
year you know 2018 they had 30

170
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:09,610
vulnerabilities this year at least when

171
00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:11,919
I pulled it earlier this in March it was

172
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:14,349
zero so maybe there's something

173
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,609
promising there but again no wonder

174
00:07:14,349 --> 00:07:19,449
we're getting breach through vulnerable

175
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:21,430
docker images and what about IOT we all

176
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:23,349
know IOT loves to make use of open

177
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:24,699
source we all do we all make use of open

178
00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:26,319
source if you're doing any modern

179
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:27,969
development you're pulling in

180
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,399
dependencies you're using open source

181
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:33,250
but what do we see happening in the open

182
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:35,379
source face most vulnerabilities

183
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:37,180
reported an open source last year were

184
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:39,310
across site scripting vulnerabilities

185
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:41,080
more than anything else and indeed if I

186
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:43,050
look back at the trends cross-site

187
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,188
scripting has been up there for years

188
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:48,520
cross-site scripting has been on the

189
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:49,960
OWASP top 10 since 2003 and we still see

190
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,779
more of those vulnerabilities than

191
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:57,789
anything else so obviously we have some

192
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:59,979
work to do and so you know what this is

193
00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:02,409
where it's time it's time to get that

194
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:05,349
brisket on the smoker and we're gonna

195
00:08:02,409 --> 00:08:08,019
build some better security so I'm gonna

196
00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:09,550
teach you today two things I'm gonna

197
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:10,039
teach you how to make a really killer

198
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:13,819
breast

199
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:17,289
using five rules that every pitmaster is

200
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:20,180
heard and hopefully most of them follow

201
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:23,808
but at the same time we're gonna connect

202
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:25,999
each of those rules to how we build our

203
00:08:23,809 --> 00:08:28,339
security programs in our enterprises

204
00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:31,129
because for all of you here we're gonna

205
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:33,198
talk these next three days about all

206
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:35,719
sorts of really cool stuff I looked

207
00:08:33,198 --> 00:08:37,909
through the laundry list of great talks

208
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:40,130
that are out there through Circle City

209
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:42,019
con all three days this is amazing we

210
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:43,549
got some great stuff there's some really

211
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:44,899
good high-level talks there's some

212
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:47,479
really good strategy talks there's

213
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:50,209
really awesome exploit talks out there

214
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:53,360
we've got the myriad it all comes down

215
00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:55,518
to though this simple fact how do I

216
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,680
build a security program whether it's in

217
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,500
my organization whether it's for

218
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,638
packages I maintain whatever it is how

219
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,050
do I build that program to make sure

220
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:04,940
that we get a little better in this

221
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:06,560
world so that's what we're gonna talk

222
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,870
about today and we're connecting it all

223
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:14,479
to the best thing in the world

224
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:18,260
brisket so the first rule that every

225
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,589
pitmaster needs to subscribe to any good

226
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:24,490
ward winning pitmaster knows this

227
00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:28,880
planning and preparation wins the day

228
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:31,970
now what do I mean you can't just go out

229
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,829
and buy a brisket and throw it on a

230
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:35,630
smoker and expect that it's gonna be

231
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:38,209
wonderful it doesn't work that way

232
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:40,790
first of all you got a plan you got a

233
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:43,750
plan because it takes hours eight ten

234
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:46,160
twelve fourteen hours to smoke a brisket

235
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,750
you're talking about something a piece

236
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,959
of meat that weighs anywhere from 11 to

237
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:52,880
18 pounds yeah I've smoked 18 pound

238
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,920
briskets

239
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:59,270
it's gonna take a while so you have to

240
00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:02,360
commit yourself to a long day of smoking

241
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:04,910
that brisket you also need to prep it

242
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,890
because if you go to a butcher unless

243
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:09,050
you're buying it and specifically asking

244
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:11,960
for it to be prepped it needs to be

245
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:13,790
trimmed first get the greatest thing out

246
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:16,070
brisket is the amount of fat in it but

247
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:17,510
that's also the thing that can screw it

248
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:19,730
up if you don't trim it down right

249
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:21,110
there's so much fat there you got to get

250
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:23,870
rid of it because it's gonna slow down

251
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:26,840
the cook and ultimately too much fat is

252
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:29,150
not a good thing so you want some of it

253
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:31,160
but you can see here I'm trimming off

254
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:32,810
large chunks of fat because that's

255
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:36,110
typically what comes on a brisket and

256
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:38,930
you need to thin that down but what does

257
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:40,400
that mean in terms of security well when

258
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:43,579
we're talking about a security program

259
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:47,720
we need to plan we need that level of

260
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:51,380
commitment we need buy-in at executive

261
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:54,440
and board levels there is no way that I

262
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:56,990
can launch a security program if I don't

263
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,780
have the sponsorship of my executives

264
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:02,780
it's just that simple it's doomed to

265
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:04,130
fail from the start because everything

266
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:07,040
that I do from a security perspective

267
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:10,100
has to align to what is meaningful for

268
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,870
the business otherwise as you all are

269
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:14,060
probably well aware if you've worked in

270
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:16,190
any organization as a security person

271
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:18,260
you know when push comes to shove the

272
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:19,670
business wins and if you're arguing

273
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,740
against the business and they're arguing

274
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:24,050
for something else they're the ones that

275
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:25,820
are going to get their way ninety-nine

276
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:28,370
out of a hundred times that's just the

277
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:30,710
way it works but that's as it should be

278
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:32,300
and I know that's kind of an odd opinion

279
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:34,160
for a security person but that's exactly

280
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:37,430
as it should be that's how business is

281
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,530
run it's our job as security

282
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:42,050
professionals to make sure that the

283
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:45,050
messages that we're bringing to those

284
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:48,170
executives show them how our security

285
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:51,010
initiatives tie into and help enable

286
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:51,010
that business now

287
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:57,020
traditionally in security our approach

288
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:58,970
has always been fun for years and years

289
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:00,770
as far back as I can remember and I've

290
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:02,900
been in security for fifteen years I've

291
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:03,980
been working in IT a hell of a lot

292
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:06,579
longer than that I'm not even going to

293
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,580
tell you how long

294
00:12:06,819 --> 00:12:10,839
you know security people have always

295
00:12:08,289 --> 00:12:12,999
been about tell the scary stories let's

296
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:15,129
scare them into doing stuff let let

297
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:17,139
let's make them nervous let's let's show

298
00:12:15,129 --> 00:12:18,819
them how bad things are gonna be if they

299
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:20,109
don't take on the security initiative

300
00:12:18,819 --> 00:12:22,779
they don't let me implement this new

301
00:12:20,109 --> 00:12:24,669
tool or this new control or they don't

302
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:26,259
fix these vulnerabilities I'm gonna

303
00:12:24,669 --> 00:12:28,978
scare them so much that they're gonna

304
00:12:26,259 --> 00:12:30,789
want to fix those things well guess what

305
00:12:28,979 --> 00:12:36,549
that doesn't work

306
00:12:30,789 --> 00:12:38,759
in fact as neuroscience tells us that

307
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:41,289
approach is actually counterproductive

308
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:42,999
so this is something really fascinating

309
00:12:41,289 --> 00:12:44,529
because when you're gonna go before

310
00:12:42,999 --> 00:12:47,769
you're bored or you're gonna go to your

311
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:49,509
executives you need to understand how to

312
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:53,109
communicate with them appropriately and

313
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:54,759
Fudd is not the effective way to get

314
00:12:53,109 --> 00:12:56,739
them to buy into what it is that you're

315
00:12:54,759 --> 00:13:00,850
telling them they need to do you're

316
00:12:56,739 --> 00:13:03,100
trying to spur them to action and fear

317
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:06,369
uncertainty and doubt are not the way to

318
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:09,819
get that action the fact of the matter

319
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:12,699
is neuroscience tells us that if I'm

320
00:13:09,819 --> 00:13:14,589
looking to discourage an action I want

321
00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:16,269
somebody to not do something I don't

322
00:13:14,589 --> 00:13:18,759
want that child to put their hand on a

323
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:21,189
hot stove the best way for me to

324
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:22,989
encourage them to or to discourage them

325
00:13:21,189 --> 00:13:25,809
from taking that action is to scare them

326
00:13:22,989 --> 00:13:27,489
that's where the fear comes in if I want

327
00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:30,159
to use fear and certainty in doubt what

328
00:13:27,489 --> 00:13:32,519
I'm doing is I'm actually I'm motivating

329
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:35,439
somebody to not do anything at all and

330
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:36,759
in fact if you think about it it makes a

331
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:39,189
lot of sense what do you do when you

332
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:41,499
perceive a threat generally our response

333
00:13:39,189 --> 00:13:45,819
is to avoid that threat we move away

334
00:13:41,499 --> 00:13:49,839
from it we don't attack it so we don't

335
00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:51,488
want to go into executives and say

336
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:55,809
here's how everything's so horribly

337
00:13:51,489 --> 00:13:59,439
scary and terrible no instead the way to

338
00:13:55,809 --> 00:14:01,959
encourage action to create that call to

339
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:04,089
go do something - to let - give me some

340
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:06,518
money so I can spend it on these tools

341
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:12,629
that are gonna make us more secure is to

342
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:15,399
show a reward what is it about my ex my

343
00:14:12,629 --> 00:14:17,289
proposal here that's gonna make things

344
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:18,990
better make you the executive look like

345
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:20,310
a hero

346
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:22,320
what's gonna drive our stock price up

347
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:24,800
what's gonna open up new business for us

348
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,120
what's gonna save us a bunch of money

349
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,490
those are the things that we need to be

350
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,110
focusing on not how scary the world is

351
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:37,710
and how we need to shut ourselves off

352
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:40,410
from it so to do that we can kind of

353
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:42,270
take a good better best approach the

354
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:45,719
good approach is to show those cost

355
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:47,189
savings that's a that's a benefit that's

356
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,470
something tangible that's something

357
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:51,870
that's going to make certain leadership

358
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:53,640
look good if I can save money because

359
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:55,830
hey I implemented this particular

360
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:57,150
security tool that's a good thing they

361
00:14:55,830 --> 00:15:01,620
like that that makes them look good

362
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:03,750
that's motivating to them but we can do

363
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:05,100
better we can get them more excited than

364
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:08,910
just oh hey you're gonna help me save

365
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:10,440
money we can actually show them how our

366
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:13,680
security expenditure will help them

367
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:16,770
tackle a wishlist item if I'm saving

368
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:19,170
them money and probably then in the form

369
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:21,810
of not just cash but resources I'm

370
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:24,349
probably freeing up resources that could

371
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:27,359
be used in other ways

372
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:29,070
every IT department I've ever seen has

373
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,410
that wishlist item that ties back to

374
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:34,050
some business initiative that's on hold

375
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:34,819
because IT can't do this thing that they

376
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:36,660
want to do

377
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:38,930
show them how you're going to make that

378
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:42,439
happen

379
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:44,510
and if you expand on that you really

380
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,100
want to get them you really want to wake

381
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,730
them up you really want them to pay

382
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,800
attention

383
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:50,870
show them how your security initiative

384
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,260
is actually going to enable a new line

385
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:56,720
of business or a new channel of Revenue

386
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:59,689
yes this happens this can be done I've

387
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,640
done it it's important because this is

388
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:03,350
the language they speak this is what

389
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:06,050
they are looking at at those higher

390
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:09,050
levels of leadership how are we going to

391
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:11,990
continue to drive our business forward

392
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:13,819
and continue to find new channels new

393
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:16,010
innovations that are going to create new

394
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:18,170
revenue for us that's the business world

395
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:21,589
and we as security people we need to be

396
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:24,649
able to speak to that so when you're

397
00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:26,779
going to go talk to an executive or to a

398
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:29,570
high-level leader there's a few things

399
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:31,399
you need to understand and I realize

400
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:33,410
that not everybody in security gets this

401
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:35,540
type of training this is crucial though

402
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:37,370
it's really disappointing that there are

403
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:39,860
so many people in the security world who

404
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:42,110
don't understand it because our job is

405
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:43,970
to convince these people that this is

406
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:46,910
what we need from them we need to get

407
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:48,980
our leadership to understand why these

408
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:50,420
things are important so first and

409
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:52,279
foremost and you go in if you're gonna

410
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:54,349
speak especially at a board level or at

411
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:56,630
an executive meeting understand your

412
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:58,220
time is very limited the higher up the

413
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:59,930
chain you go the shorter the amount of

414
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:02,450
time you're gonna have to talk so you

415
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:05,419
got to be able to say everything you

416
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:06,920
want to say in three minutes this is not

417
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:09,079
the case where you go in there with a

418
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:11,000
you know big intro tell them what you're

419
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:12,919
gonna say then tell them then tell them

420
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,750
what you said no you jump right to the

421
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,000
point boom here it is what is the most

422
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:19,069
salient point that you have that's the

423
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,709
first thing you tell them and then let

424
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:23,300
it flow from there the second thing be

425
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:26,900
prepared for interruptions and don't

426
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:28,459
take it personally understand that you

427
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,470
are going to be asked tough questions

428
00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:32,480
and they're not going to wait until the

429
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:33,620
end of your presentation to ask you they

430
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,570
are going to be right there

431
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,860
they're gonna want to know fast they

432
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:38,780
have a lot of things on their mind

433
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,639
they're working through a hundred

434
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:42,740
different things as you're sitting there

435
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,270
talking to them they're gonna ask the

436
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:46,760
questions as they come to mind that

437
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:49,450
that's typically in those spaces how

438
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:52,059
these leaders function

439
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:54,880
and so be prepared for that and as such

440
00:17:52,059 --> 00:17:56,408
be prepared for the questions know what

441
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,659
the questions are that they're gonna ask

442
00:17:56,409 --> 00:18:00,880
before you get in there think about it

443
00:17:58,659 --> 00:18:02,649
from their perspective if you didn't

444
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,750
know anything what would you be asking

445
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:05,918
and go in they're prepared to answer

446
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,649
those questions

447
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,149
that's how you win support you go in and

448
00:18:08,649 --> 00:18:12,879
they ask you a bunch of questions you

449
00:18:10,149 --> 00:18:14,018
say I don't know one or two maybe if you

450
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,370
say hey I got to do a little more

451
00:18:14,019 --> 00:18:17,019
research you can get away with that if

452
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:18,428
every question they ask you're

453
00:18:17,019 --> 00:18:20,529
unprepared to answer you're not going to

454
00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:22,659
get that support if you can go in there

455
00:18:20,529 --> 00:18:25,240
and you can be prepared and you have the

456
00:18:22,659 --> 00:18:27,940
data to back up your answers that's

457
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:30,970
that's gold when it comes to any support

458
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:34,360
from executives so let's go back to

459
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:36,370
barbecue this is the one rule that I

460
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,678
think everybody who's ever attempted

461
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:41,709
barbecue has heard said somewhere along

462
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:44,620
the way pitmasters rule number two

463
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:46,899
low and slow you can't rush it when I

464
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:48,158
talk about low and slow I'm talking

465
00:18:46,899 --> 00:18:52,889
about that number you see in the upper

466
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:54,940
left there that 225 225 degrees that is

467
00:18:52,889 --> 00:18:57,250
exceptionally cool if we're thinking

468
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:58,990
about how we normally bake food but

469
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:01,690
we're not baking where you're smoking

470
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:04,450
we're cooking that stuff and to cook it

471
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:08,260
we want to keep it low and we wanted to

472
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:11,260
cook slow this is why it takes 14 hours

473
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:13,990
to smoke a brisket because we're doing

474
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:15,519
it at a low temperature that's what

475
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:19,149
makes it juicy that's what makes it

476
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:20,590
tender we can't rush that if you jack up

477
00:19:19,149 --> 00:19:23,279
the temperatures and you try to make it

478
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:26,110
happen fast you'll just ruin that meat

479
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:29,320
this is why you have to be patient you

480
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:30,820
can't rush this stuff you can't just

481
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,250
throw it on there and have it done in a

482
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,939
couple hours and go to eating it doesn't

483
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:38,350
work that way

484
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:40,769
nothing happens that fast when it comes

485
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:43,330
to security it's kind of the same thing

486
00:19:40,769 --> 00:19:44,740
we can't expect that our security

487
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:47,049
initiatives are going to secure

488
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:49,210
everything tomorrow and we need to make

489
00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:51,070
sure that the folks that we're working

490
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:53,110
with our leadership that we're trying to

491
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:54,549
gain sponsorship from they need to

492
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:57,590
understand that as well and it's up to

493
00:19:54,549 --> 00:20:00,869
us to share that message

494
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:03,809
so don't try to boil the ocean instead

495
00:20:00,869 --> 00:20:05,570
think about is there anybody sick of the

496
00:20:03,809 --> 00:20:08,220
castle metaphors

497
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:10,080
well that's because when we do these we

498
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:13,080
always talk about it like we need these

499
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,549
big strong walls on the outside but the

500
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,649
reality is if you look at a castle like

501
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:18,059
this this is dover castle the way they

502
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:20,428
built it was with this big strong

503
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:22,200
fortified keep in the middle first and

504
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:24,269
then they built all their defences

505
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,859
around it and that keep is what houses

506
00:20:24,269 --> 00:20:28,350
everything it was most critical all

507
00:20:25,859 --> 00:20:32,580
their most crucial assets we need to do

508
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:33,809
the same thing with IT security so it

509
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:36,570
starts with how we think about those

510
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:39,749
assets if I'm talking in the context of

511
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:43,529
an organization my assets aren't aren't

512
00:20:39,749 --> 00:20:46,799
IT systems they could live anywhere

513
00:20:43,529 --> 00:20:48,539
assets could be anything yes digital

514
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,369
transformation is creating the need for

515
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:52,049
these systems but what is the actual

516
00:20:50,369 --> 00:20:54,238
asset what actually means something in

517
00:20:52,049 --> 00:20:56,489
my business well how do I make money as

518
00:20:54,239 --> 00:21:00,059
a business it's things like private data

519
00:20:56,489 --> 00:21:03,450
how do I protect the privacy of my

520
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:05,158
customers of my people this is what's

521
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:06,509
important this is what we need to be

522
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:08,549
aware of when we think about the

523
00:21:06,509 --> 00:21:12,389
business or how about those critical

524
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:14,940
functions if I work in a utility

525
00:21:12,389 --> 00:21:18,359
industry my ability to deliver

526
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:20,340
electricity is an asset because that is

527
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:22,379
the thing that's making me money if I'm

528
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:25,228
not delivering electricity I'm not

529
00:21:22,379 --> 00:21:27,149
making money that's how it works these

530
00:21:25,229 --> 00:21:28,609
are the assets I care about when it

531
00:21:27,149 --> 00:21:31,109
comes to that type of business

532
00:21:28,609 --> 00:21:33,869
what about your financial assets that

533
00:21:31,109 --> 00:21:37,499
one's kind of more obvious right how do

534
00:21:33,869 --> 00:21:40,549
I prevent you know threats against just

535
00:21:37,499 --> 00:21:40,549
our financials

536
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:45,860
you ever think about people as an asset

537
00:21:43,299 --> 00:21:47,840
we kind of do in the terms of like HR

538
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:50,178
but think about from a business sense

539
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:53,029
think about from a security sense it's

540
00:21:50,179 --> 00:21:54,860
up to us to protect the people because

541
00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:57,190
those people can be crucial think about

542
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:59,110
health care

543
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:01,150
if our doctors can't do their jobs if

544
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:04,139
our nurses can't do their jobs if our

545
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:06,340
other care workers can't do their jobs

546
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:09,100
what good are those Hospitals and

547
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:11,169
Clinics we need to be able to defend

548
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:15,490
them and then finally of course there's

549
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:17,730
all the secrets trade secrets you name

550
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:20,170
it there's always that proprietary

551
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:24,370
confidential data that we need to keep

552
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:26,740
safe many of those especially the trade

553
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:29,169
secrets have a direct impact on a bottom

554
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:30,580
line of the organization so those are

555
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:33,430
the things that we need to think about

556
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:36,899
that we're trying to protect we need to

557
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:39,390
think when we start looking at threats

558
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:42,520
we need to look at threats in terms of

559
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:45,700
these assets the assets that mean

560
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:48,820
something to the company now how do we

561
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:50,650
go about this crazy idea I have of what

562
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:52,210
I call inside out security where I'm

563
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:53,460
starting with that Keith well it's

564
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:57,820
pretty simple

565
00:22:53,460 --> 00:23:01,050
find those assets build your defenses

566
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:04,060
around them but start at the asset first

567
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:06,460
we're all probably very familiar with

568
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:09,280
this concept of the you know the hard

569
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:11,050
outer shell and the gooey middle well

570
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,639
that's because we always build our

571
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:14,260
defenses that way we start at the

572
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,580
perimeter you think about when we

573
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,690
started putting computers on the

574
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:18,399
Internet the first thing we do is we

575
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:20,679
build firewalls to protect the networks

576
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:24,820
that we were connecting to the Internet

577
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:26,139
we didn't defend inside that we need to

578
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:28,658
think about it differently we need to

579
00:23:26,139 --> 00:23:32,110
start building from the inside out and

580
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:34,090
do it in stages we can't boil the ocean

581
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:36,309
and expect to build this all at once

582
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:37,178
we've got to get incrementally better

583
00:23:36,309 --> 00:23:41,408
over time

584
00:23:37,179 --> 00:23:43,119
that's how security programs live so

585
00:23:41,409 --> 00:23:45,009
what does that process look like well I

586
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:47,860
already said you identify your assets

587
00:23:45,009 --> 00:23:49,539
from those assets you can determine what

588
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:53,830
the threats are and now you can

589
00:23:49,539 --> 00:23:56,980
translate those assets into IT assets

590
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:59,499
and now those threats you can translate

591
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:02,019
into technical threats that affect those

592
00:23:59,499 --> 00:24:03,820
IT systems from there you can start to

593
00:24:02,019 --> 00:24:05,529
establish those micro perimeters so what

594
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:06,999
does that perimeter look like maybe that

595
00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:10,480
perimeter is the edge of your database

596
00:24:06,999 --> 00:24:12,820
maybe that perimeter is the edge of a

597
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:16,269
particular micro service maybe that

598
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:18,789
perimeter is one segment of a largely

599
00:24:16,269 --> 00:24:20,830
segmented Network whatever it is

600
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:23,980
establish those micro perimeters and

601
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:26,379
defend them build your defenses that way

602
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:28,450
and then assess them assess those

603
00:24:26,379 --> 00:24:32,469
defenses and then it's just simply wash

604
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:34,980
rinse repeat constantly building

605
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:38,320
assessing and improving your defenses

606
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:40,539
it's continuous improvement that's what

607
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:43,090
security needs to be doing to be

608
00:24:40,539 --> 00:24:46,830
effective in the world of ever-changing

609
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:51,039
technology that we're sitting in today

610
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:57,230
go low go slow it will be worth it in

611
00:24:51,039 --> 00:25:01,070
the end so moving on next rule

612
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:02,090
master's rule number three good smoke is

613
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:06,110
essential

614
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:08,928
dirty smoke will ruin you and it'll ruin

615
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:11,799
your meat what am I talking about with

616
00:25:08,929 --> 00:25:14,390
good smoke so take a look at this image

617
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:17,179
look at that smokestack for a second

618
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:20,870
look at the smoke coming out of that

619
00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:23,090
smokestack you can barely see it it's

620
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:26,029
very thin it's very wispy it's very

621
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:30,168
almost bluish in color

622
00:25:26,029 --> 00:25:33,739
as a pitmaster that's the kind of smoke

623
00:25:30,169 --> 00:25:35,899
that I want that smoke tells me that my

624
00:25:33,739 --> 00:25:39,849
fuel is burning efficiently and for me

625
00:25:35,899 --> 00:25:39,849
my fuel is typically LOX

626
00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:46,549
if I've got big billowy white smoke

627
00:25:43,609 --> 00:25:49,698
pouring out of there that's a sign that

628
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:51,559
I've got inefficient burning and the

629
00:25:49,699 --> 00:25:56,119
problem with inefficient burning is that

630
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:59,569
it creates creosote and creosote lines

631
00:25:56,119 --> 00:26:03,079
your meat with a very ultra bitter taste

632
00:25:59,569 --> 00:26:05,299
and once it's on the meat it's over you

633
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:08,899
won't get rid of that taste and it can

634
00:26:05,299 --> 00:26:11,299
ruin a wonderful piece of meat a

635
00:26:08,899 --> 00:26:12,559
wonderful cut of brisket or ribs or

636
00:26:11,299 --> 00:26:15,739
whatever it is that you got on your

637
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:18,559
smoker so one of the keys when you're

638
00:26:15,739 --> 00:26:21,579
smoking any form of barbecue is making

639
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:24,079
sure you've got that good clean smoke

640
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:27,259
well what is clean smoke when I'm

641
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:30,229
talking security it's accurate and

642
00:26:27,259 --> 00:26:32,479
effective metrics we don't like to think

643
00:26:30,229 --> 00:26:34,369
about this a lot in security we're

644
00:26:32,479 --> 00:26:36,919
focused on technical issues we're

645
00:26:34,369 --> 00:26:39,259
focused on exploits worth we're focused

646
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:41,119
on apts and what they're doing out there

647
00:26:39,259 --> 00:26:42,589
and we want to know what TTP's they're

648
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:44,779
following and we got all these cool

649
00:26:42,589 --> 00:26:48,168
acronyms and things at the end of the

650
00:26:44,779 --> 00:26:51,409
day we don't like thinking about metrics

651
00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:53,959
in security because that's like that

652
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:57,439
other soft stuff that other people do

653
00:26:53,959 --> 00:27:01,459
and we don't worry about it but if I'm

654
00:26:57,439 --> 00:27:06,259
building a security program it's totally

655
00:27:01,459 --> 00:27:08,929
not helpful if I can't measure what the

656
00:27:06,259 --> 00:27:10,819
success is of that security program how

657
00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:12,949
do I know if it's good or bad how do I

658
00:27:10,819 --> 00:27:15,889
tell those executives who just gave me

659
00:27:12,949 --> 00:27:18,169
millions of dollars to go spend on a

660
00:27:15,889 --> 00:27:21,228
security initiative that their money was

661
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:25,789
well spent if I don't have good metrics

662
00:27:21,229 --> 00:27:27,379
that are effective and accurate so

663
00:27:25,789 --> 00:27:29,059
understanding the tooling I have

664
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:33,009
understanding how I can collect that

665
00:27:29,059 --> 00:27:36,349
data what data do I even want to collect

666
00:27:33,009 --> 00:27:39,619
these are all the things that we need to

667
00:27:36,349 --> 00:27:42,069
be aware of these are things that we

668
00:27:39,619 --> 00:27:44,809
have to plan for from the beginning

669
00:27:42,069 --> 00:27:47,119
because this is how we're going to

670
00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:50,889
establish the continued success of that

671
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:53,309
program so let's talk for a minute about

672
00:27:50,889 --> 00:27:55,270
goals

673
00:27:53,309 --> 00:27:58,120
anytime I'm gonna launch an initiative

674
00:27:55,270 --> 00:28:00,550
my leadership is going to ask me four

675
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,689
goals what am I trying to accomplish how

676
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:04,780
am I going to know that I've been

677
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:07,360
successful what is that thing what do I

678
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:10,809
need to get to that's going to tell me

679
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:13,120
that hey you made it yet you did good

680
00:28:10,809 --> 00:28:15,730
what am i measuring myself against and

681
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:18,040
what I'm going to tell you is goals are

682
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:20,050
important you need to have these laid

683
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:22,030
out because that that gives you that

684
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:24,250
mission it you're going to drive toward

685
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:25,720
this is our vision for security looks

686
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:30,550
like this this is where we want to get

687
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:32,230
to we're gonna drive to get there but

688
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:34,389
what I also tell you is that those goals

689
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:36,100
should be based on improvement not

690
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:37,809
attainment and what do I mean

691
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:40,240
so improvement is greater than

692
00:28:37,809 --> 00:28:43,030
attainment when I see improvement

693
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:46,630
I want my metrics to look at how am I

694
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:50,920
getting better not setting a target of

695
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:53,500
hey I got a hit X number of these or you

696
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:57,900
know this is my hundred percent mark I

697
00:28:53,500 --> 00:29:00,309
gotta get there how did I improve

698
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:03,940
quarter over quarter or year over year

699
00:29:00,309 --> 00:29:05,710
in some meaningful metric this is how

700
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:07,270
you measure the success of a program and

701
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:09,970
this is what you need to prepare your

702
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:12,520
leadership to understand they'll accept

703
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:14,980
this they understand it if we're not

704
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:16,420
selling them a solution as this is the

705
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:18,040
end-all be-all answer that's gonna fix

706
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:21,160
all of our woes and vulnerability

707
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:22,928
management then they don't expect all

708
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,980
the woes of vulnerability management to

709
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:27,070
be fixed after you've bought that

710
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:28,750
product if you say this is going to

711
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:31,178
allow us to incrementally get better and

712
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:33,320
better and better over time here's how I

713
00:29:31,179 --> 00:29:34,880
see that laid out

714
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:37,939
that's an effective metric that's

715
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,920
realistic that you can actually hit go

716
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:42,560
buy into that the same way in fact a lot

717
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:44,360
the smarter leaders out there they

718
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:46,070
understand this and that's actually what

719
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:49,610
they want they don't want you to give

720
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:53,470
them promises of absolute wins and and

721
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:55,699
you know a hundred percent vulnerability

722
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:58,490
remediations and all the all these crazy

723
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:59,780
things that people talk about we we know

724
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:02,780
us security people it's not going to

725
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:04,670
happen so why do we let executives or

726
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:06,379
leadership believe that that's what's

727
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:07,760
gonna happen why do we sometimes mislead

728
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:11,840
them and even tell them that's what's

729
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:15,110
gonna happen lay out a plan they have a

730
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:18,230
plan of continuous improvement work with

731
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:20,659
them to understand that this is what

732
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:21,860
we're doing as we get incremental e

733
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:26,470
better and better and better we're

734
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:26,469
reducing the risk to the organization

735
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:32,120
I'm talking to shareholders or I'm

736
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:36,310
talking to a CEO or I'm talking to a CRO

737
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:39,919
that's what Mia matters most to them

738
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:43,010
what is security doing to reduce the

739
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:47,780
risks to our organization that's

740
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:51,350
meaningful metrics now metrics are great

741
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:53,510
across the organization I'm sure many of

742
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:55,370
you listening right now your your

743
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:56,810
embroiled in this you're creating

744
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:59,179
reports and they're growing every which

745
00:30:56,810 --> 00:31:00,649
way and you have to generate them and

746
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:03,080
maybe that's part of why we don't like

747
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:07,430
metrics and security because it's so

748
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:08,899
onerous but we can probably alleviate a

749
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:12,980
lot of that by just being aware of our

750
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:15,980
audience who sees that report where does

751
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:17,990
that report go are the metrics that are

752
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:20,480
in that report meaningful to that

753
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:22,820
audience am I trying to cover all

754
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:26,080
audiences with the same report that's

755
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:26,080
not a really great idea

756
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:30,020
those executives on the right they've

757
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:32,600
got a far different interest than those

758
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:35,510
engineers on the left

759
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:37,879
engineers they need timely data they

760
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:39,379
need very granular data they need will

761
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:42,500
understand if you're telling me I have

762
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:44,000
seven high severity vulnerabilities in

763
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,890
my queue right now that need to be

764
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,910
remediated well I need to understand the

765
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:51,110
details of those on the right side they

766
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:52,790
don't care so much about those

767
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:54,229
individual vulnerabilities they care

768
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:57,649
about the trends they care about the

769
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:59,570
risk picture what does it look like

770
00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:02,990
and they want to see those numbers on a

771
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:04,909
periodic basis that fits their working

772
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:07,820
model which is generally something like

773
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:10,160
a quarterly or a monthly report where's

774
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:12,830
those engineers most of them want to see

775
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:14,590
that stuff real time so how can I put

776
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:18,350
stuff into tracking databases or

777
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:19,730
ticketing tools things like JIRA where

778
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:22,850
they're already living in anyway so they

779
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:26,180
can view that information and then they

780
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:27,560
can pull that out on demand they know

781
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:34,880
right where they stand at a moment's

782
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:39,110
notice that's effective work pit master

783
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:42,230
rule number four there is no set it and

784
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:44,659
forget it if you're gonna be smoking

785
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:48,440
meat this isn't like throwing a frozen

786
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:50,600
pizza in the oven for 15 minutes on 400

787
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,460
degrees and then it's done and you take

788
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,800
it out and you eat it doesn't work that

789
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:56,960
way

790
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:58,250
now I know if they've Kennedy's out

791
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,620
there somewhere listening this right now

792
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:03,650
he's screaming what my Traeger but my

793
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:05,419
Camp Chef these pellets smokers you just

794
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:07,760
put all the pellets in and they go and

795
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:09,200
it does it yes there are some smokers

796
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,210
that are easier than others but it's

797
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,570
still work and it's not something you

798
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:16,700
just walk away from for me I don't use a

799
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:20,210
pellet smoker I use as I mentioned

800
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:23,540
before a wood burner and so for me it's

801
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:25,550
constant process of fire management to

802
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:28,340
make sure that I keep that fire burning

803
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:29,810
efficiently but at the right temperature

804
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:33,409
so it doesn't get too hot and ruin the

805
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:35,210
meat so if I'm keeping things 225 to 250

806
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:37,910
where I like to have them for my brisket

807
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:39,770
it's due in part because I'm constantly

808
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:42,140
managing that fire I might be able to

809
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:45,080
walk away for maybe a half hour to an

810
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:46,790
hour at a time but it's something that I

811
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:49,550
have to constantly be aware of through

812
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:51,620
the process that's part of the process

813
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:53,870
for me it's kind of cathartic thing I

814
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:57,469
actually enjoy that's part of what I

815
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:59,330
enjoy about the process but

816
00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:01,429
even with a pellet smoker you're still

817
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:02,928
there's a task you need to do you need

818
00:34:01,429 --> 00:34:04,490
to refill the pellets from time to time

819
00:34:02,929 --> 00:34:07,669
you need to monitor your temperatures

820
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:09,949
you don't just walk away from it you're

821
00:34:07,669 --> 00:34:12,349
always watching that meat to make sure

822
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:14,989
that everything stays the way you want

823
00:34:12,349 --> 00:34:16,099
it over that duration of the hours and

824
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:18,529
hours and hours that it's going to be

825
00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:22,070
sitting on that smoker so when I think

826
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:25,250
about this in terms of an organization

827
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:27,770
I'm thinking about how do I have those

828
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:31,280
constant touch points across my

829
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:33,409
organization we look at the modern devs

830
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,570
AQAP's motion today we've actually got

831
00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:36,889
three motions we've got security trying

832
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:39,710
to push left we've been doing that for

833
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:42,159
decades we've got developers now who are

834
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:46,659
pushing farther and farther right

835
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,659
they're writing code that creates

836
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,879
the infrastructure that their

837
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:52,348
applications are going to run on and

838
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:54,299
because infrastructure is being created

839
00:34:52,349 --> 00:34:57,210
as code we've got the ops teams moving

840
00:34:54,299 --> 00:34:58,740
up the stack they now have to be aware

841
00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:01,859
of how to look at that code and

842
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:06,290
understand it and that's very different

843
00:35:01,859 --> 00:35:06,290
scenario than we're ever used to before

844
00:35:06,349 --> 00:35:11,609
what we're used to in security is we're

845
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:14,069
used to be in those gates we're used to

846
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:16,290
being that checkpoint that happens

847
00:35:14,069 --> 00:35:19,420
between the phases of the software

848
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:22,240
delivery lifecycle

849
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:23,890
and that's that's it that's what we do

850
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,720
oh you're done

851
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:26,950
you know you're done with your code and

852
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:29,319
you're gonna commit it okay we're gonna

853
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:30,848
run a SAS tool we're gonna run software

854
00:35:29,319 --> 00:35:32,558
composition analysis we're gonna see

855
00:35:30,849 --> 00:35:33,670
what vulnerabilities you have and then

856
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:34,780
when we find where to send it back to

857
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:38,260
you and you gotta go back to the

858
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:40,390
development process again those cyclical

859
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:44,170
motions don't work when we're talking

860
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:45,970
DevOps when we're talking continuous

861
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:51,040
integration continuous deployment it's

862
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:54,879
even worse so how do we do this

863
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:57,369
differently well we need to stop being

864
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:01,540
the gates between the phases and start

865
00:35:57,369 --> 00:36:03,339
becoming part of the phases now I know

866
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:04,960
this is there's plenty of talks out

867
00:36:03,339 --> 00:36:08,589
there on Deficit cops and how do we put

868
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:11,230
security into the DevOps space but this

869
00:36:08,589 --> 00:36:13,779
is what it breaks down to those

870
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:15,549
immediate feedback cycles real-time

871
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:17,950
information that developers can work

872
00:36:15,549 --> 00:36:19,780
with throughout the process and it's not

873
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:22,629
just the development teams it's our

874
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:24,040
business folks as well bring them in do

875
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:26,230
you see that threat modeling on the far

876
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:27,250
left talk about pushing left have you

877
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:30,240
ever thought about doing a threat

878
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:31,890
modeling in your backlog

879
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,810
can you have somebody when they write a

880
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:36,509
user story actually write up a threat

881
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:37,890
model of that user story now you've

882
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:39,780
really pushed for our left and you've

883
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:41,460
got valuable information that developers

884
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:43,290
can use to design their code and write

885
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:44,940
it you've got valuable information that

886
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:46,710
can be used to build and test that code

887
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,880
and it flows through the whole process

888
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:50,130
because now you even know what you have

889
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:52,830
to monitor post-deployment all from

890
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:56,609
doing that threat model early on in the

891
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:58,560
cycle right there into user story other

892
00:36:56,609 --> 00:36:59,310
things you can do meet those developers

893
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,990
where they live

894
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:03,540
meet your business people where they

895
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:05,819
live walk a mile in their shoes programs

896
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:07,980
are great some people call them job

897
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:11,010
shadowing but it can be even bigger than

898
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:12,990
that how do you have your security

899
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:15,240
people working with your ops and your

900
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:17,098
dev people how do you bring business

901
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:19,259
folks into that so everybody has a

902
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:21,690
context of what the others job entails

903
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:24,119
we build that empathy and suddenly now

904
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:26,339
when we have a new initiative that we're

905
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:28,530
going to bring to them it's a lot easier

906
00:37:26,339 --> 00:37:30,650
for us a to design that initiative in a

907
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:32,940
way that it'll be easily adopted and be

908
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:35,820
to get them to understand why it's

909
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:37,980
important because they've now seen our

910
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:40,320
job they understand our mindset we

911
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:42,930
understand theirs and we can work

912
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,970
collaboratively to build security

913
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:47,640
initiatives that people actually adopt

914
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:50,069
and that's that whole idea then of

915
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:52,410
mutual engagement how many of you

916
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:55,390
security folks actually attend stand-ups

917
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:58,509
for your developers

918
00:37:55,390 --> 00:38:01,629
if you're involved in a software

919
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:04,660
development organization your job as a

920
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:05,770
security person is to educate how do you

921
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:10,230
educate the people that are building

922
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:10,230
your software even products in general

923
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:14,700
how can you become more collaborative

924
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:16,890
and have those consistent touch points

925
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:20,850
you don't just set your security

926
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:23,339
initiatives and forget them get in there

927
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:24,839
with the developers get in there with

928
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:29,490
the ops people bring in the business

929
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:31,830
people make those stand-ups a situation

930
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:34,080
where now there can be collaboration and

931
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:35,880
information sharing outside of just

932
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:37,500
those small teams I'm not saying every

933
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:40,470
standup every day you need to have a

934
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:42,270
security person in maybe it's a weekly

935
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:45,600
sprint planner bi-weekly sprint planning

936
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:47,790
or how offered however often they go

937
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:50,310
this can take different forms we'll be

938
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:52,170
actively engaged in those processes

939
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:54,120
don't wait for them to hand you

940
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:56,130
something and say here tell me if this

941
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:59,790
is secure and if I can go to production

942
00:38:56,130 --> 00:39:03,990
with it and then finally this idea of

943
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:06,029
paving the road Netflix is very famous

944
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:09,419
for their idea of the pave Road concept

945
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:15,420
where security is the path of least

946
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:17,610
resistance how do I create a path to

947
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:20,790
creating a secure software that makes it

948
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:22,920
easier for the developers to get to

949
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:26,009
deployment then if they went other ways

950
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:27,300
that were less secure this is the idea

951
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:28,830
of a paved road and it comes from a

952
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:32,250
couple things Automation first and

953
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:34,920
foremost DevOps is about a lot more than

954
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:36,860
automation notice this is the first time

955
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:39,590
I'm talking about tooling within DevOps

956
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:42,090
this is where it comes into play though

957
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:46,080
having the automation where we make it

958
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:48,300
easy for them to use those technologies

959
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:49,799
that we want them to use to take those

960
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:52,050
different steps that we want them to

961
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:54,180
take building things into their ideas

962
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:56,520
building things into the repo that

963
00:39:54,180 --> 00:40:00,089
validate their security as they're

964
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:01,920
coding that creates that paved road so

965
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:05,220
picking the right tools to do that and

966
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:07,050
then trusting the developers you're

967
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:09,720
enabling them with the ability to make

968
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:11,680
sure their stuff is secure now make them

969
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:14,830
accountable

970
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:17,169
set that culture that hey it's up to you

971
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:19,210
to do this but understand that if it's

972
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:23,530
not done this is how the accountability

973
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:25,180
works so rather than expecting security

974
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:26,620
teams to constantly be running pen tests

975
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:28,839
and everything else against every new

976
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:35,589
code update how can we design that

977
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:38,740
differently and finally rule number five

978
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:41,950
for pit masters and this is kind of a

979
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:44,549
general life lesson by the way know your

980
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:50,379
tools your abilities and your

981
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:53,290
limitations so I said that smoker there

982
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:55,540
was not my first smoker I bought a

983
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:58,810
really small one I started simple and

984
00:40:55,540 --> 00:41:01,610
I've upgraded but what if I gone and

985
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:03,590
bought something like this

986
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:05,990
this is a real thing that this belongs

987
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:07,910
to a colleague of mine I did he won't

988
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:11,959
tell me how much he spent on it but I

989
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:13,250
know it's over $80,000 if I gone out and

990
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:15,710
got in a smoker like this first of all I

991
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:18,290
be broke but more importantly how would

992
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:21,920
I ever make use of that as a newbie

993
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:23,930
first-time BBQ pitmaster buy something

994
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:27,770
like that I wouldn't even know how to

995
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:31,190
use it even now I've been barbecuing for

996
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:34,160
over a decade I'm not sure I could make

997
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:38,960
use of that today it's crazy it's wild

998
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:40,460
it's awesome don't get me wrong but why

999
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,470
do I need to go out and buy the biggest

1000
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:45,320
baddest most powerful tool for

1001
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:47,359
everything that I want to accomplish no

1002
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:51,860
instead when I had to upgrade my smoker

1003
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:52,460
I went I bought this one now I mean it's

1004
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,720
not little

1005
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:56,360
unfortunately the picture doesn't really

1006
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:59,660
do it justice that's a 55-gallon smoke

1007
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:02,860
chamber so it's big I can fit three or

1008
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:02,859
four briskets on there easily

1009
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:09,940
but it's what I can manage it's what I

1010
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:12,700
can control

1011
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:16,600
it's what I know how to use and it's

1012
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:18,819
what suits my needs I didn't go by all

1013
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:20,520
the super high-end bells and whistles

1014
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:25,570
and everything I need

1015
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:27,790
know I looked at what my requirements

1016
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:31,120
were what I wanted to be able to

1017
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:32,650
accomplish what features were most

1018
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:34,120
important to me there's particular

1019
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:36,550
features about this I'm not going to

1020
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:39,520
dive into here but there's very specific

1021
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:41,560
features about this particular smoker a

1022
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:45,130
hint if you notice the smoke stacks on

1023
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:48,490
the same side as the firebox that I

1024
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:53,260
really wanted and so I bought the things

1025
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:56,680
that were most important to me and I

1026
00:42:53,260 --> 00:43:00,070
didn't over buy unfortunately when it

1027
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:03,790
comes to the security space that's not

1028
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:05,830
how we do it when I look at security

1029
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:07,110
initiatives traditionally companies

1030
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:11,200
overspend

1031
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:14,770
now this looks like good news security

1032
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:17,350
budgets in 2020 this survey from fireEye

1033
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:19,750
they looked at they talked to a bunch of

1034
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:22,360
CEOs about what do you expect for 2020

1035
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:24,010
as far as your cybersecurity budgets you

1036
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:27,160
see most of them said they were going to

1037
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:30,070
increase about 15% said they'd stay the

1038
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:33,520
same and decreasing budgets were

1039
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:35,380
definitely not the norm that's a great

1040
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:37,150
news we got all this money to spend

1041
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:39,430
finally we've been asking for money in

1042
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:42,040
security to go spend and make things

1043
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:46,990
more secure and now we got it and then

1044
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:48,190
whoops hi kovat happened how many of us

1045
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:49,899
out there right now are dealing with

1046
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:52,180
shrinking budgets because business is

1047
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:54,600
slowed down and we can't spend money on

1048
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:57,839
security right now

1049
00:43:54,600 --> 00:44:00,180
lots of us maybe that's not such a bad

1050
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:02,760
thing because when you have all that

1051
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:03,680
money here's what's staring you in the

1052
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:08,400
face

1053
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:11,310
hey hmm lots of cool tools lots are

1054
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,690
really big powerful tools they do all

1055
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:14,759
sorts of really neat things

1056
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:17,040
I got risk and compliance tools I've got

1057
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:18,810
threat analysis and protection Identity

1058
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,580
and Access Management managed security

1059
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:22,560
providers infrastructure security

1060
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:25,348
endpoint security application security I

1061
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:30,930
want to buy all the things

1062
00:44:25,349 --> 00:44:30,930
that market is worth 177 billion dollars

1063
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:37,140
we can't buy all the things

1064
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:40,829
we can't buy all the biggest baddest

1065
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:42,960
things now I'm gonna pick on some

1066
00:44:40,829 --> 00:44:45,420
friends in mind we can't run out and

1067
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,369
always buy the biggest baddest Cisco

1068
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:50,130
equipment which may not even be the best

1069
00:44:47,369 --> 00:44:51,780
anyway no shame on Cisco love their

1070
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:54,599
stuff love their ecosystem don't get me

1071
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:56,220
wrong but we can't always go out and buy

1072
00:44:54,599 --> 00:45:00,480
the biggest baddest solution we don't

1073
00:44:56,220 --> 00:45:03,118
always need to buy the biggest baddest

1074
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:05,490
available solution we need to buy what

1075
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:09,270
is right sized for our organizations

1076
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:11,729
keep our budgets realistic and not blow

1077
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:14,490
ourselves out of the water with these

1078
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:16,740
huge huge expenditures on systems that

1079
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:17,790
aren't what we needed in the first place

1080
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:21,259
and we're not going to be able to

1081
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:23,279
demonstrate that we used effectively

1082
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:27,960
this is some fascinating information

1083
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:31,170
here 60-plus think about what this

1084
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:35,069
number might mean for a second 60 plus

1085
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:38,030
the real numbers reported between 50 and

1086
00:45:35,069 --> 00:45:42,150
70 so I just kind of went in the middle

1087
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:48,599
that is the average number of tools in

1088
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:53,329
use within organizations for security 60

1089
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:53,329
security tools on average

1090
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:58,750
how are we managing this we complain

1091
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:00,940
that vendors don't have stuff that works

1092
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:02,589
together well we throw out 60 different

1093
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:03,190
tools how do you expect all those to

1094
00:46:02,589 --> 00:46:08,049
work together

1095
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:10,799
come on 35% think about what this might

1096
00:46:08,049 --> 00:46:10,799
mean for a minute

1097
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:20,270
35% of those tools have overlapping

1098
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:25,460
functionality 35% of those tools

1099
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:25,460
accomplish the same tasks

1100
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:33,299
why did we buy another one we had a tool

1101
00:46:30,869 --> 00:46:34,979
that would do the work was that tool not

1102
00:46:33,299 --> 00:46:36,930
sufficient and why didn't we get rid of

1103
00:46:34,979 --> 00:46:39,529
it and replace it rather than just add

1104
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:39,529
another tool

1105
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:44,060
well it was too complex we couldn't do

1106
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:46,970
the analysis these are the things that

1107
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:49,790
hold us back as a security industry when

1108
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:52,370
we talk to executives and so forth and

1109
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:56,000
it finally 80% I bet you can all by now

1110
00:46:52,370 --> 00:46:59,160
guess what this is 80% of those tools

1111
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,930
are under utilized

1112
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:02,580
that means they're not being used to

1113
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:04,470
their fullest potential instead of

1114
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:06,720
buying a new tool that's gonna overlap

1115
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:09,470
why not just use those tools to their

1116
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,470
fullest potential

1117
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:14,730
so let's bring this all together we've

1118
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:16,800
got our programs so we know from the

1119
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:18,930
barbecue side planning and preparation

1120
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,730
wins the day on the security side that

1121
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:22,859
means we need to win executive

1122
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:26,040
sponsorship we need to show those

1123
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:28,020
business values low and slow you can't

1124
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:30,240
rush it well what does that mean in the

1125
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:31,530
business world and security it means

1126
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:33,390
you're not going to be able to secure

1127
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:35,370
everything tomorrow stop trying to boil

1128
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:38,000
the ocean and focus on that continuous

1129
00:47:35,370 --> 00:47:38,000
improvement

1130
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:42,310
eat that good smoke it's essential dirty

1131
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,799
smokes gonna kill you the same thing if

1132
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:46,660
you're you need those good metrics you

1133
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:48,910
need those good statistics that good

1134
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:50,740
monitoring if you don't have it it's

1135
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:54,670
gonna kill you if you've got bad data

1136
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:59,109
it's gonna kill you there is no set it

1137
00:47:54,670 --> 00:48:00,760
and forget it no instead we need to

1138
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:03,580
build a culture of enablement and

1139
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:06,790
accountability we need to be actively

1140
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:08,200
involved with our business organizations

1141
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:10,630
our development organizations are

1142
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:13,180
operational organizations we need to be

1143
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:16,470
a part of their space and finally know
