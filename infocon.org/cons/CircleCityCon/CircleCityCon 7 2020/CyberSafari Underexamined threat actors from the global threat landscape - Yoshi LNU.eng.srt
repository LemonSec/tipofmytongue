1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,580
taking advantage of the asymmetric

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:09,330
benefits of cyber capabilities to focus

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:12,269
their operations and use that power we

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,610
can identify their motivations unique

5
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:16,079
techniques and targets and this gives us

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,240
a better understanding of the global

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,430
threat picture for the blue teamers

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,560
hopefully you'll be able to gain some

9
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,890
information that might help you improve

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,140
your threat modeling and may give you

11
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,510
something that you ask your red team to

12
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,880
emulate next engagement for the red

13
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,739
teamers hopefully you pick up some some

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,380
interesting tips there's a lot of cool

15
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:40,940
campaigns out there that we get to learn

16
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:44,370
about so let's go a little bit by myself

17
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:47,670
my name is Yoshi I do healthcare cyber

18
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:50,519
intelligence have some certs beef I got

19
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,899
my background in political science which

20
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,570
is what I really enjoy the geopolitical

21
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:58,530
aspect of threat intelligence used to be

22
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:00,329
with the FBI about until 2019 and now I

23
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,210
work in healthcare so feel free or

24
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:05,250
follow me on Twitter so when we talk

25
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,930
about for intelligence there are a lot

26
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,700
of models to start talking about hey

27
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,590
what is an adversary and what you like

28
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,229
to do how do we classify them how do we

29
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,600
cluster them my favorite and one of the

30
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:18,030
older ones is the diamond model so when

31
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,490
we see the diamond model we start first

32
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,140
on the left angle and that's the

33
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,360
infrastructure so when we talk about

34
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:28,320
infrastructure we mean everything from

35
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:30,270
the email accounts that are used for to

36
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,820
send phishing emails we mean the command

37
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:35,850
and control IPS possibly the domain

38
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,750
registrations and all of that so that's

39
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,509
sort of what we mean when we talk

40
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,820
infrastructure so when we talk victim

41
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:43,140
I think victims more diverse than people

42
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,809
think

43
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:49,110
first off at a big level means country

44
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:52,170
what countries are targeted how do they

45
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:54,600
relate to the geopolitical things going

46
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,399
on second a little lower down would be

47
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,399
what industry started targeted are they

48
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,140
targeting healthcare or they targeting

49
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:06,240
aerospace are they targeting any

50
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:09,860
specific vertical that may be a

51
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,859
requirement for a nation-state

52
00:02:10,068 --> 00:02:13,849
little lower down would be okay what

53
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,708
information at each of those tell me

54
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:17,840
he'll be going for and then drilling

55
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:20,989
down even more what people are talking -

56
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,750
are they talking - and fishing the

57
00:02:20,989 --> 00:02:26,239
customer advocates the company are they

58
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:29,060
talk of a fishing of doctors researchers

59
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,950
so that's sort of how we get fine-tuned

60
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:34,400
into that victim part of the diamond

61
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:37,548
model as well that next we have

62
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,889
capabilities so capabilities I like to

63
00:02:37,549 --> 00:02:41,269
use the attack matrix with capabilities

64
00:02:39,889 --> 00:02:45,370
because I think it gives a really good

65
00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:47,629
way of giving a objective view of

66
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:50,419
capabilities and they say hey this actor

67
00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:52,220
did these three different techniques and

68
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:53,450
those fall into their capabilities

69
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,250
obviously attack doesn't cover

70
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:58,790
everything especially for some of those

71
00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:01,579
more advanced techniques but it does a

72
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:03,620
really good job and finally looking at

73
00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:05,450
adversary depending on who you're

74
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:10,220
talking to order you're working for

75
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:11,659
adversary changes so sometimes it means

76
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,389
who is the human behind the keyboard

77
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:15,858
who's the person that's actually typing

78
00:03:14,389 --> 00:03:17,810
those commands and exfiltrating that

79
00:03:15,859 --> 00:03:19,489
data sometimes it might be the

80
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:22,099
organization that they work for is it a

81
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:25,940
front company is it an intelligence

82
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:27,319
organization and then or is it not the

83
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,120
organization that's actually doing the

84
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:31,790
hacking but is there a customer of a

85
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,239
government that's requested that hey we

86
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:36,379
want airline down okay well who's asking

87
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:42,530
those requirements and that fits into

88
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:44,358
the adversary piece of diamond model so

89
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:47,150
next we're talking about national

90
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:49,699
responsibilities so this is a scale

91
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,840
Jason Healey put this out and I think

92
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:53,659
it's important to talk about when we

93
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,859
talk about state Nexus cyber actors so

94
00:03:53,659 --> 00:04:00,530
it goes from the left state prohibited

95
00:03:56,859 --> 00:04:01,609
that's where the cyber actors don't work

96
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,829
with the government they don't work for

97
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:05,209
the government in fact if the government

98
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:06,049
knew what they were doing the government

99
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:07,609
will stop them

100
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:09,439
most people would argue that for the

101
00:04:07,609 --> 00:04:11,769
most part in the United States does a

102
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,930
state prohibited thing and you start

103
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:16,250
launching a DDoS attack the government's

104
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:18,469
gonna stop you or at least they're gonna

105
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:21,889
investigate you and come talk to you and

106
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:23,480
stop you the next level up is state

107
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:26,510
prohibitive but inadequate

108
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:28,340
so what that means is that the state

109
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:30,260
doesn't like that actors are doing

110
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:32,090
certain activities but they can't stop

111
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,680
it so they just don't have the resources

112
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:36,109
the time whether it's corruption

113
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,080
whatever reason that means they just

114
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:40,970
can't do it they're inadequate next is

115
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,349
stay ignored state knows about it and

116
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:45,800
just doesn't care

117
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:47,990
that's very close to the prior one but

118
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:52,250
just the motivation is not there to act

119
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:54,770
against those individuals and the next

120
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:56,960
two are kind of similar so the first one

121
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:59,719
state encouraged on the next ones state

122
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,940
shaped so state encouraged basically

123
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,760
means that the government is encouraging

124
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:06,110
an actor to do something and then state

125
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,960
shape means they're actually giving them

126
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:10,760
pay due to specific tasking usually

127
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,739
these are third party actors a good

128
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,210
example of this would be irani

129
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,840
hacktivists they don't work for the

130
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:20,049
government they're not necessarily

131
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,799
members of the military but they are

132
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:25,850
advocating for that what the government

133
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:29,570
want and conducting operations based off

134
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:32,930
of that so then we get up to state

135
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:34,490
coordinated so this is where the

136
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:37,760
government starting to talk to those

137
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:41,120
contracting companies or those hackers

138
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:43,520
and say hey this is who you should

139
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,520
attack hey please attack or Target

140
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:50,299
Boeing please and there's sort of that

141
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:51,950
coordination there the next one it's

142
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,270
pretty close is going to be state

143
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:55,750
ordered so the government's actually

144
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:58,099
telling you hey you need to attack a

145
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,810
Boeing and that's the state order then

146
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:02,780
it's they're tasking you you've been

147
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:05,720
hired and you're being tasked the 8th

148
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:08,989
one sort of interesting that's the state

149
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:12,080
rogue but conducted so what that means

150
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:14,060
is we seen a lot with North Korean

151
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,039
actors and Chinese actors where they

152
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,900
have their day jobs and that they're

153
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:20,510
conducting state-sponsored intrusions

154
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:22,570
but then they're also moonlighting so

155
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:24,380
you have a uniformed actor who's then

156
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:28,310
making some extra money on the side

157
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:30,620
that's the state room conducted finally

158
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:33,530
is state executed so that's when you

159
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:35,210
have uniformed military or intelligence

160
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:36,460
personnel that are actually conducting

161
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:40,419
the operations

162
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:42,070
on behalf of the state and then last one

163
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:45,040
above that is when those uniformed

164
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:46,630
military folks or those intelligence

165
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,900
officers bring in those third parties

166
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:51,430
and they work in tandem all right

167
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,690
so that's sort of a level of national

168
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:57,310
sponsibility that we'll go and talk

169
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:58,630
about so real quick here's just a brief

170
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:01,060
of some of the countries we'll be

171
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:03,850
talking about so let's get started so

172
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:07,200
we're going to start with the

173
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:10,750
Netherlands now when you think about

174
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:12,250
technical operations and hackers most

175
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:15,160
most people probably don't think about

176
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:16,990
the Netherlands no offense to anyone

177
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,790
there but they're just that's not

178
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:21,670
something comes to mind at first but in

179
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:23,380
2018 a Dutch newspaper revealed one of

180
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:26,290
the most sophisticated and successful

181
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:28,170
hacking operations against an apt and I

182
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:32,260
think is pretty pretty interesting so

183
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:35,080
the aivd Dutch intelligence managed to

184
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:36,909
get a clue into cozy bears operations

185
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:40,000
doesn't say exactly what that clue is

186
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:42,220
but regardless they were able to then

187
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,150
identify the building that cozy bear was

188
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:49,120
sitting in of course this is pre Kobe 19

189
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:51,429
so no one was working from home but

190
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,590
everyone was still in the building and

191
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:55,030
based off the good preparation and

192
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:56,830
planning that they did they were able to

193
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:59,080
do more than just pop boxes on the

194
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:00,550
network they weren't just hacking cozy

195
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:03,219
bear they were able to hack into the

196
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:05,500
security cameras and record everyone

197
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:07,600
that was going to and from the building

198
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,550
so not only do they have access to the

199
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,440
technical network they can then identify

200
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:13,450
individuals that are going to and from

201
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,010
the building which you can then

202
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:18,280
coordinate for kind of intelligence

203
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:19,750
purposes and this according to the news

204
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:22,330
people are allowed the Dutch to tip off

205
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:23,860
the Americans about cozy bears attacks

206
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:27,460
against the State Department including

207
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:29,590
their infrastructure c2 targets and it

208
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:33,490
also allowed them to attribute because

209
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:35,319
you go to SVR and that's I think it was

210
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:37,180
pretty interesting as far as the

211
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:42,750
Netherlands are concerned

212
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:45,579
so next we have France really in France

213
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:48,730
reportedly originated in 2027

214
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:50,380
oh sorry 2007 they're known as Babar

215
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:53,020
animal farm

216
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:55,480
they're targeting included Iran Syria

217
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:58,180
Mali Malaysia and others what's

218
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,280
interesting about France and Animal Farm

219
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:01,449
they had a very diverse set of malware

220
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04,240
that covered a lot of different

221
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:06,010
platforms but their target was extremely

222
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,650
targeted they worked really hard to only

223
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:10,420
target the individuals they wanted to so

224
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:15,670
one of the more advanced sets

225
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:19,150
I'm very targeted next we have Spain so

226
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:21,310
known as the mask correcto according to

227
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:24,550
Texas first they started also started in

228
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:28,209
20 2007 and they were reported on

229
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:30,910
publicly and attributed in 2014 they

230
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:34,360
were extremely advanced they had over

231
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:36,640
300 victims and 31 countries including

232
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:40,570
governments energy research institutions

233
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:42,689
private equity equity and activists and

234
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:44,650
the interesting thing was is Kaspersky

235
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:47,140
discovered them when they tried to

236
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:48,400
exploit a vulnerability in a commercial

237
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,199
product

238
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,880
the other interesting thing Kaspersky

239
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,760
tracked them as well they're more

240
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:56,860
advanced nation safe threats in part

241
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,560
because once especially started sinking

242
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:00,880
their commanding control servers they

243
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,530
shut down the operations and tore it

244
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,570
down within them I think matter of hours

245
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:06,490
so really interesting that there is that

246
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:11,290
level of visibility on their own

247
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:14,440
infrastructure to conduct that object as

248
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:16,240
far as attribution goes for this threat

249
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,810
they were able to attribute it through

250
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:23,680
Whois information obviously before gdpr

251
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:27,939
as well as Spanish language relations

252
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:30,550
both in the lawyers in the malware so

253
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:31,810
this is a beautiful picture as part of

254
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:33,160
the service that were Safari you'll

255
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:35,260
notice I'm putting in pictures of the

256
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,540
places that I wish I could visit and

257
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:40,950
which I'm sure you some of you do too

258
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:43,839
but this is actually from Turkey so

259
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:45,370
Turkey is really interesting to me and

260
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,860
again not one of those countries that

261
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:49,550
you wouldn't necessarily think of the

262
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,649
first actor

263
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:55,490
that his attribute to Turkey is called

264
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:58,220
strong pity or promethium in 2016

265
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:59,930
Microsoft released a report talking

266
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:02,930
about how promethium have been operating

267
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:04,670
since 2012 the interesting thing is

268
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:06,589
they've contact or they've done

269
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:09,920
campaigns against both domestic and

270
00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:12,019
international targets specific

271
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:15,709
individuals within interest to your

272
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:18,430
political and just another interesting

273
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:20,839
fact is that they have done both

274
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:23,180
phishing like a lot of people do to get

275
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:24,920
in but then also succeeded web

276
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:27,519
compromises or watering holes so they

277
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:30,680
they started her that dual-pronged

278
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:33,589
initial infection vector their 2016

279
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:35,689
campaign used as your daemon Dobby I was

280
00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:37,730
actually delivered via instant messenger

281
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:42,370
client which again is another

282
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:42,370
interesting way to deliver that fishing

283
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:47,120
along with that in one of their

284
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:50,600
campaigns will there later campaigns I

285
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:55,700
think in 2018 they were started using

286
00:11:50,600 --> 00:12:00,170
trojan eyes encrypter programs

287
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:01,790
Kaspersky mentioned that they targeted

288
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:04,160
people both in Belgium and Italy which

289
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:08,800
is sort of interesting but still with

290
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:10,459
the locale saying set to Turkish

291
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,000
Kaspersky did an excellent job

292
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:15,229
documenting traverses of the malware

293
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,850
those dropped after the initial

294
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:19,490
infection I'll have all the citations

295
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:21,529
for all this reporting available at the

296
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:23,290
end for anyone that's interested

297
00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:26,750
the other interesting thing is that this

298
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:29,899
strong pity campaign in 2016 had strong

299
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:33,140
ties with neo diem another group

300
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:35,089
Microsoft tracks and that group actually

301
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:37,910
probably uses finfisher malware for

302
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:38,990
espionage purposes but they between the

303
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:42,170
two sets

304
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:43,490
share targets insured I don't believe

305
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:44,930
infrastructure we shared targets and

306
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:49,040
around the same timeframe which is the

307
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:51,890
interesting correlation another

308
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,980
interesting group for Turkey is sea

309
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:57,860
turtle so in April 2019 Cisco Chows

310
00:12:54,980 --> 00:13:00,110
reported on the group they targeted

311
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:02,060
national security organizations in the

312
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:03,290
Middle East and North Africa including

313
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:07,219
organizations from Cyprus

314
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:09,110
Greece Iraq Albania Egypt Armenia United

315
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,930
Arab Emirates Jordan Syria and Sweden so

316
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:15,380
quite a quite a long list of countries

317
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:17,930
and they sea turtle has the first

318
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:21,680
publicly reported example of widespread

319
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:24,079
DNS hijacking the actors were extremely

320
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,719
successful because what they first did

321
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:29,029
was targeted third parties whether that

322
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,649
be the DNS registrar's the

323
00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:32,389
telecommunications companies or the

324
00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:34,220
internet service providers

325
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:38,209
once they gained access to those targets

326
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:39,649
they were then able to hijack the DNS of

327
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:41,959
the primary targets the national

328
00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:43,970
security organisation so first they used

329
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:45,649
mostly known vulnerabilities and some

330
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:52,220
fishing to get into those third parties

331
00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:55,880
and then they changed the DNS settings

332
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:58,720
to have a man-in-the-middle actor

333
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:01,339
controlled server so what happened was

334
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,250
they were able to redirect legitimate

335
00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:07,339
users from those organizations through

336
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:09,319
their box and intercept and then harvest

337
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:11,089
their credentials as extremely

338
00:14:09,319 --> 00:14:13,519
successful and widespread according to

339
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:17,029
Reuters credentials including email

340
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:20,079
service email accounts cloud services

341
00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:22,579
and online network passwords usernames

342
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:25,189
their attribution that Reuters used

343
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:27,949
attribute them to actors acting in the

344
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:29,720
Turkish interest was based on three

345
00:14:27,949 --> 00:14:30,760
things the first being victimology and

346
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,149
we talked about all those countries

347
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:37,459
being of geopolitical interest to Turkey

348
00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:39,170
similarities to past campaigns using

349
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:41,239
these similar techniques and then

350
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:44,260
confidential intelligence that Reuters

351
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,260
was shown

352
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:55,440
so obviously there is a ton that could

353
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:58,110
be said about Israeli cybersecurity

354
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,630
I don't have the time and I am nowhere

355
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:02,310
near an expert to discuss all of

356
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:04,830
everything is going on cybersecurity

357
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:08,719
with Israel so we're going to just look

358
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:11,070
at two examples first would be Dooku 2.0

359
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,200
and this I think is an interesting

360
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:14,910
example because you see an example of

361
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,380
fourth or possibly fifth party

362
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:20,280
collection where hackers are hacking

363
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:22,640
hackers to see the hackers so the New

364
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:27,150
York Times report on the story where the

365
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:29,819
do be 2.0 and Israel hacked in to

366
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:31,980
Kaspersky to gather intelligence

367
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:35,340
Kaspersky eventually identified this

368
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:38,160
campaign but the Israelis were allegedly

369
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:41,040
able to identify Russian hackers inside

370
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:44,660
of Kaspersky hacking Kaspersky searching

371
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:50,939
for American intelligence so you have

372
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:53,130
Israelis hacking Kaspersky hacking with

373
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:55,190
Russian hackers inside that we're

374
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:58,730
looking for information on American apts

375
00:15:55,190 --> 00:16:00,780
so quite a convoluted collection there

376
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:04,020
the attackers ended up stealing

377
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:05,780
passwords documents screenshots and

378
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:08,490
emails related to apt work that

379
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:10,470
Kaspersky was doing particularly those

380
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:13,140
related to the equation group and region

381
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:15,680
other targets of the campaign that was

382
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:18,300
identified include hotels and venues

383
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,520
related to national security

384
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:23,609
specifically sorry the UN Security

385
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:26,730
Council relating to the JP Khoa or the

386
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:30,000
Iran deal those were in the hotels that

387
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:32,130
were targeting again because first you

388
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,230
put out a great blog if you're in the

389
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:36,780
group and Dooku 2.0 I'm definitely

390
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:37,710
recommend looking into it

391
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:40,709
and also when we talk about

392
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:42,560
cybersecurity we'd be amiss to not

393
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:44,670
mention the private companies in Israel

394
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:47,040
probably one of the best known is the

395
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:49,500
NSO group and most of you probably know

396
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,760
they're embroiled in a lawsuit against

397
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,670
Facebook for using a what's that

398
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:57,330
vulnerability so when we talk about

399
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:59,579
Israel cybersecurity what techniques can

400
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:00,839
we look at to possibly improve our own

401
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:03,570
craft

402
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:05,790
and what we've seen is that NSO tools

403
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:07,980
like phantom and Pegasus are all mostly

404
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:11,040
used for quote-unquote legitimate

405
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:12,510
purposes but vices reported that they've

406
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,760
been targeting human rights dissidents

407
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:18,629
journalists and political opponents by

408
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:21,629
the SI loop customers so when we talk

409
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:24,120
about actual campaigns it looks like a

410
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:26,189
lot of the lerz appear to be on

411
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:27,629
subscribe' links or Facebook links up

412
00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:29,250
something you wouldn't mind clicking on

413
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,510
because hey it's just just turnout and

414
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,340
subscribe

415
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:35,250
the other interesting thing is that the

416
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:37,350
SR group appears to have procured

417
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:39,809
infrastructure from cloud providers in

418
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:42,090
the United States so it'll be a Sheena

419
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:43,620
wash this case to continue and see what

420
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:51,030
other infrastructure ends up getting

421
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:55,559
burned through the lawsuit so next we

422
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:59,070
have Lebanon and so BFF and lookout

423
00:17:55,559 --> 00:18:00,750
originally identified dr. dark coracle a

424
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:02,460
third actor allegedly supporting the

425
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:06,600
general director of general security in

426
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:08,549
Lebanon so it was first originally

427
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,129
identified based on infrastructure

428
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:13,320
reused from operation manual which will

429
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:14,760
briefly discuss later but dark Oracle's

430
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:17,909
considered an apt for a couple reasons

431
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:21,480
the first they were able to conduct

432
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:23,910
multiple campaigns at once exfiltrating

433
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,669
hundreds of gigabytes of data so they

434
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:30,450
were very successful that way the ffs

435
00:18:26,669 --> 00:18:32,309
reported targets in the government the

436
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:34,559
military military targets utilities

437
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:37,350
financial institutions healthcare and

438
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:40,110
manufacturing some of those hundreds of

439
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:42,740
gigabytes of data that was expelled

440
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:45,719
include documents call recordings

441
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:50,280
contacts photos and just general account

442
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:52,380
information the interesting piece about

443
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,149
this campaign is that the mobile malware

444
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,760
was used there was actually the primary

445
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:58,530
attack platform for this campaign

446
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:02,179
initial access did start with phishing

447
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:04,470
or social engineering but then also this

448
00:19:02,179 --> 00:19:07,590
initial access also started with

449
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:09,090
physical aspects to targets so someone

450
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:11,990
actually had physical access to the

451
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:13,860
phones of the target that was being used

452
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:17,670
palace which is the woman

453
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:21,600
the malware that was being used on the

454
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:25,170
mobile hours often or was a Trojan iced

455
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:27,059
app that was made to the App Store it's

456
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:30,059
reported that dark rock will also used

457
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:33,540
finfisher malware similar to what we

458
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:33,990
talked about earlier uh it with near

459
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:37,170
doom

460
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:39,450
neo diem the other malware used includes

461
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:41,670
Pandu crack cross rat

462
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:43,890
and while the infrastructure being used

463
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:46,740
for this was shared among multiple

464
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:49,110
actors the e FF was able to fingerprint

465
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,429
some of it uniquely and when we talk

466
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:53,699
about attribution this is one of the

467
00:19:50,429 --> 00:19:57,990
strongest attributed sets because what

468
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:59,880
happened was the logs and directories

469
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:03,179
were opened on the command control

470
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,880
infrastructure they were able to take

471
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:08,240
those locks identify the testing devices

472
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:12,590
that was testing infrastructure prior to

473
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:15,480
the campaign being conducted and then

474
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:18,330
once they did those testing devices they

475
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:20,700
also looked and saw the Wi-Fi networks

476
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:24,780
associated with those devices based off

477
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:26,730
of that they then went and did some osen

478
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:28,320
on those Wi-Fi devices in a Wi-Fi

479
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:30,570
networks rather and were able to

480
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:34,799
pinpoint those Wi-Fi networks to a

481
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:37,530
specific building in Lebanon and then on

482
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:39,690
top of all of that the committee control

483
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:41,309
infrastructure had three IP addresses

484
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:45,750
that were the main command control and

485
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:50,160
those were controlled by actors or the

486
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:52,530
IPS were from the state-owned AG arrow

487
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:58,020
telecom so that's pretty strong

488
00:20:52,530 --> 00:21:00,178
attribution so next we have the United

489
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:03,809
Arab Emirates stealth Falcon and fruity

490
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:06,780
Armour so in 2016 the intercept

491
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:10,260
published an article detailing Dark

492
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:14,820
Matters recruitment of foreign cyber

493
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:17,250
operators to hack for Kinect offensive

494
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:18,720
operations forward the government the

495
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:21,030
report that was then followed up with

496
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,730
reporting from Reuters that showed how X

497
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:26,580
and sa hackers were hacking for project

498
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:27,900
Raven which is what they called Dark

499
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:30,659
Matters project

500
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:32,160
from mention Abu Dhabi the interesting

501
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:33,450
thing is is that the alleged targets

502
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,730
include human rights activists

503
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:37,950
journalists and political rivals the

504
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:40,980
Malheur was called karma and did not

505
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:43,020
require any user interaction and it

506
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:46,320
obtained photos text and location

507
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:48,230
information it's possible and it's been

508
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:53,399
hypothesized that a use an iMessage

509
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:55,110
zero-day also 2016 since and Lam

510
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,780
published a separate report on stealth

511
00:21:55,110 --> 00:22:00,330
falcon and that report was targeted

512
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:02,549
against or the campaign reported on

513
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:05,668
targeted critics of the government of

514
00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:08,309
the UAE what happened was the first

515
00:22:05,669 --> 00:22:10,950
stage was to profile the devices the

516
00:22:08,309 --> 00:22:13,168
user was using so the fishing link used

517
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:15,210
to redirect URL to profile devices and

518
00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:17,880
then later on the conversation fished

519
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:22,530
them with malware that was targeted to

520
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:25,409
their device with a mail dock and then

521
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:28,010
that male duck returned that eventually

522
00:22:25,409 --> 00:22:31,350
got to a customized PowerShell backdoor

523
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:36,059
similar to Empire not not the exact same

524
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:38,189
but similar and then back in 2019 ESET

525
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:40,289
republished a but report about binary

526
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:42,419
that bares remarkable similarity to the

527
00:22:40,289 --> 00:22:45,480
backdoor that was disclosed by citizen

528
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:49,049
lab in 2016 they noted the targets and

529
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:51,990
similar same thing of UAE inside the UAE

530
00:22:49,049 --> 00:22:54,929
Saudi Arabia Thailand and a mission to

531
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:57,750
the Netherlands one of the other ties

532
00:22:54,929 --> 00:22:59,059
this attribution was the binary used

533
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:02,760
this one the same for any control

534
00:22:59,059 --> 00:23:05,010
domains as the PowerShell backdoor that

535
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:09,330
was previously disclosed by citizen lab

536
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:11,539
so don't forget that the adversary also

537
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:17,340
sometimes gets lazy and reuses

538
00:23:11,539 --> 00:23:20,990
infrastructure so Morocco yes that is a

539
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:23,399
camel from Morocco according to pixabay

540
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:26,429
was another company I was interested to

541
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:29,490
find on some research on so in 2018

542
00:23:26,429 --> 00:23:32,429
highest found tax against a variety of

543
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:35,549
French infrastructure firms once they

544
00:23:32,429 --> 00:23:37,919
sinkhole domain they were able to obtain

545
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:39,450
the registrant information and

546
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,770
eventually found an email address for

547
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:43,620
one of the DNS servers

548
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:46,230
that was hosting the IP addresses in

549
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:48,659
March of 2020 Brian Krebs does what he

550
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:50,580
does best of dachshund people took that

551
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:52,800
email address traced it through some

552
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:54,330
forums and found a Moroccan security

553
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:58,200
researcher who was tied to the forum

554
00:23:54,330 --> 00:24:00,240
posts and that email of course that

555
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,750
security researcher ever denies being

556
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,710
affiliated with any of the attacks

557
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:07,890
because of course his email was hacked

558
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:09,720
conveniently during the time and at this

559
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:11,310
point we won't know who directed and

560
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,470
sponsored the intrusion but it's

561
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:14,820
definitely interesting example of the

562
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:16,860
government sort of doing that state

563
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:21,439
encourage where they're directing but

564
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:21,439
not necessarily doing it themselves so

565
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:28,100
next we have is Becca Stan they've been

566
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:31,919
around for a while their National Police

567
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:35,730
sss first took interest in commercial

568
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:38,520
hacking tools starting in 2011 and it

569
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:43,290
came and light when phineas fisher to

570
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:45,840
dumped the hacking team stuff now in

571
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:48,830
2019 brian bartholomew from Kaspersky

572
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:51,540
are presented a virus bulletins on apt

573
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:54,510
tattoos Pakistan's Intelligence Agency

574
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:56,580
the strong attribution to the SSS was

575
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:58,890
possible and due to horrible aspect

576
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:01,939
sorry excuse me horrible

577
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:04,110
OPSEC by the individual operators

578
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:05,730
Kaspersky was able to identify the team

579
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:08,040
based off of the Whois records that

580
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:12,630
listed the intelligence officers true

581
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:13,590
name and military unit 0 to 6 1 6 so

582
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:16,740
liver age is put in the register

583
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:18,740
information do not understand how that

584
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:22,020
was available to researchers

585
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:25,050
so that's the first off-site failure

586
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:28,040
the next offsets failure was that they

587
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:31,830
had Kaspersky antivirus running on their

588
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:35,670
testing machines so once there was any

589
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:38,100
sort of alert Kaspersky was able to one

590
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:41,160
see what they were testing and to grab a

591
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:42,990
and profile it so because of this

592
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:46,200
because first he was able to grab and

593
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:49,950
identify multiple 0 days that had been

594
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:52,980
purchased by the organization in

595
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:53,840
Uzbekistan and this just shows that the

596
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:56,450
this sort

597
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:59,480
visibility as the antivirus softwares

598
00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:01,820
have especially are in countries outside

599
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,890
the US is really interesting and

600
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:10,299
excellent for hunting those smaller

601
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:13,909
adversaries so another beautiful view

602
00:26:10,299 --> 00:26:15,820
not sure I never seen this sort of view

603
00:26:13,909 --> 00:26:20,150
before but this is actually in Pakistan

604
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:21,080
so when we talk about Pakistan we have a

605
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:23,059
couple different groups that are

606
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:25,010
attributed so the first one is gonna be

607
00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:26,658
Gore in the group it's interesting

608
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:28,460
because of the wide range of both

609
00:26:26,659 --> 00:26:30,260
espionage and financially motivated

610
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:33,260
campaigns sort of getting to where we

611
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:36,879
see that that rogue act at rogue state

612
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:40,340
actor going on so in February of 2018

613
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:43,940
unit 42 identified the Gorgon group

614
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:46,549
targeting the UK Spain Russia in the

615
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:48,140
United States those same campaigns

616
00:26:46,549 --> 00:26:51,649
actually shared infrastructure with

617
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:53,480
financially motivated campaigns couple

618
00:26:51,649 --> 00:26:57,379
of the interesting things about this

619
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:59,000
group is they used URL shortening so it

620
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:00,350
allowed them both to track their own

621
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,059
metrics which is always good when you

622
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:05,799
are conducting campaigns but also a lot

623
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:09,980
of researchers to enumerate and collect

624
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:11,830
metrics on the actor themselves when we

625
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:15,740
talk about capabilities for this group

626
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:18,379
they used a variety of rats most most of

627
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:21,590
the time use NJ rat and also use info

628
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:24,740
skills like looking by and back in

629
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:27,020
October 2019 prevailing on the security

630
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:29,570
vendor talked about another campaign

631
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:31,399
that they were doing the lured documents

632
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:34,309
again used your short name URL

633
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:37,939
shortening services and this time they

634
00:27:34,309 --> 00:27:40,010
redirected to blogspot URLs so you have

635
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:42,890
the fishing that we directed the

636
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:46,850
blogspot the JavaScript reached out to

637
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:49,370
paceman in R and some code to

638
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:51,590
established persistence the escape of

639
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:53,870
tasks in registry keys and then once

640
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:57,649
those changes were successful another

641
00:27:53,870 --> 00:28:00,229
paceman URL was accessed yeah after all

642
00:27:57,649 --> 00:28:02,289
those paceman infection chains the

643
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:05,480
infection team eventually led to a rack

644
00:28:02,289 --> 00:28:06,600
used it was ravindra and then became as

645
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:10,230
well

646
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:13,980
while they were monitoring it so really

647
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:15,890
interesting yes there the other apt type

648
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:18,780
to Pakistan is transparent tribe or

649
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:21,090
mythic Leopard or sometimes apt 36

650
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:23,280
depending on who you're talking to

651
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:25,199
in 2016 proof points Darren Hass

652
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:27,960
published the research that identified

653
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,309
phishing attacks targeting military or

654
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:32,760
sorry tournament Indian military

655
00:28:29,309 --> 00:28:36,090
resources the fish included a weaponized

656
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:39,840
RTF document that dropped a PE that

657
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:41,459
eventually led to a rat interesting is

658
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,240
in addition to these phishing campaigns

659
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:47,490
they also had registered multiple blocks

660
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:51,080
to act sort of watering holes they have

661
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:54,210
posted examples that the Indian military

662
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:56,070
are articles that they Indian military

663
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:57,750
would be interested in whether it be

664
00:28:56,070 --> 00:29:00,720
about discipline issues about latest

665
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:04,409
unrest I believe with China and they

666
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:07,200
were able to allegedly give some victims

667
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:09,090
from that as well and that dual pronged

668
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,600
approach something that I think's pretty

669
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:11,600
interesting

670
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:18,190
in 2017 sinful reported actors tied to

671
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:20,410
trench right now i targeted officials

672
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:23,050
from the indian Central Bureau of

673
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:24,430
Investigation in the Indian Army while

674
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:28,000
masquerading as the Institute for

675
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:30,790
Defense analyses as we've seen this

676
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,610
continues the historic targeting of or

677
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:36,340
sorry past hardening of Indian

678
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:38,290
government officials in May of 2018

679
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:40,689
crushed I continued this trend by

680
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:44,830
reporting that they were using generic

681
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:47,740
excel themed lures and then a customized

682
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:50,980
visual basic skirt installed right of

683
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:52,810
implants again crash track identified

684
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:56,080
mythic leopard c2s that were used

685
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:58,389
against or from multiple campaigns the

686
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:01,139
long-running c2m pressures and OPSEC

687
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:03,010
failure but it's also sometimes a misfit

688
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:06,250
it's already set up it's already

689
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:09,690
configured and depending on the

690
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:12,090
adversaries goals may be good enough and

691
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:15,010
then just recently in back in March

692
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:16,300
matter Malwarebytes reported that this

693
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:19,750
actor like many others had begun using

694
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:21,730
Kobe 19 relay dealers and had shifted

695
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:24,420
the turning from both India to then also

696
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:29,100
Afghanistan as well

697
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:29,100
so this next

698
00:30:29,299 --> 00:30:37,289
picture of a tiger from India so you'll

699
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,149
notice that this slide is not nearly as

700
00:30:37,289 --> 00:30:42,080
neat as the others

701
00:30:39,149 --> 00:30:45,750
that's because Indian cybersecurity

702
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,889
attribution is a mess both on seat Nexus

703
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:49,080
operations and on the criminal

704
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:50,580
operations we're gonna look at some of

705
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,740
the campaign's that have a nexus to

706
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:55,559
India and talk about different throw

707
00:30:52,740 --> 00:31:00,360
troops but overall it's just a general

708
00:30:55,559 --> 00:31:03,350
mess so in March of 2018 as a cutaneous

709
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:05,939
security vendor started talking about a

710
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:08,340
specialized lures that were targeting

711
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:09,809
Chinese government agencies the lead

712
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:12,870
document ended up dropping a dotnet

713
00:31:09,809 --> 00:31:14,720
executable Q at that scheduled tasks and

714
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:17,580
then eventually led to another rack

715
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:20,460
documents with an X filled via HTTP POST

716
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:25,199
to the C to a couple of their vendors

717
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:28,380
reported similar things to next time but

718
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:31,020
including a campaign against the USA

719
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:32,460
u.s. well so this this apt used similar

720
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:35,580
techniques in the campaign against both

721
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:38,460
Chinese government officials and US

722
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:40,230
think tanks while masquerading as a u.s.

723
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:42,929
think tank

724
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:45,559
what they also did and I'm sure so the

725
00:31:42,929 --> 00:31:48,779
red teamers out here also done this is

726
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:51,149
used an embedded image in an email to

727
00:31:48,779 --> 00:31:52,409
track the beacon back to track who

728
00:31:51,149 --> 00:31:55,379
actually opened the emails and who would

729
00:31:52,409 --> 00:31:58,200
think clicking it was unique so it

730
00:31:55,380 --> 00:32:01,980
allowed it actually who was clicking and

731
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:04,740
again the final payload of that campaign

732
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:06,690
was case alright the interesting thing

733
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:08,820
is that the actual exploit that was used

734
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:11,580
was pulled from proof-of-concept they've

735
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:15,149
been published on github and was likely

736
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:16,860
not developed internally to act work and

737
00:32:15,149 --> 00:32:18,870
that that copy and pasting from github

738
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:22,320
and open source is actually what gave

739
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:24,379
this ap the name of Patrick a deception

740
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,100
vendor symmetry or saw threat actor

741
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:28,679
operating in one of their deception

742
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:31,350
platforms and they were able to then go

743
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:34,110
out and grab the lures from that

744
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:36,928
document what they saw was two things

745
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:40,449
one they were saw variety of tool

746
00:32:36,929 --> 00:32:42,730
they've been downloading and taking from

747
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:45,460
but they're able to also obtain the lewd

748
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:47,649
documents that the ABC was using in this

749
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:50,799
campaign it was all related to China and

750
00:32:47,649 --> 00:32:53,529
South China Sea so and used like we

751
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:57,340
talked about the vulnerabilities and

752
00:32:53,529 --> 00:33:00,600
exploits that were available publicly in

753
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:03,189
these these allegedly state-sponsored

754
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:06,279
based actress for India had not gone

755
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:09,730
anywhere in fact unit 42 just recently

756
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:12,429
released released reporting on Viceroy

757
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:13,419
tiger and early May this activity

758
00:33:12,429 --> 00:33:16,090
targeted government military

759
00:33:13,419 --> 00:33:18,549
organizations what's written is they

760
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:21,749
really cared about being detected so

761
00:33:18,549 --> 00:33:24,908
they really tried hard to blend in and

762
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:28,600
assume that they were impersonating

763
00:33:24,909 --> 00:33:30,190
legitimate services so they did this in

764
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:32,230
a couple ways they use things like self

765
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:34,749
signed certificate so that the software

766
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:36,009
were signed unique file descriptions so

767
00:33:34,749 --> 00:33:37,840
it just looked like another piece of

768
00:33:36,009 --> 00:33:39,879
corporate software that you'd find on

769
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:42,279
your machine and then also convincing

770
00:33:39,879 --> 00:33:45,730
error messages there weren't typos it

771
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:47,019
was pretty convincing campaign the

772
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:49,659
interesting thing is is that instead of

773
00:33:47,019 --> 00:33:52,830
just attaching the mailbox to their

774
00:33:49,659 --> 00:33:55,570
phishing campaign they were able to

775
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:57,639
directly deliver documents so instead of

776
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:59,379
doing that the actors hosted their

777
00:33:57,639 --> 00:34:01,330
payloads on compromised third-party

778
00:33:59,379 --> 00:34:02,889
websites within the country of their

779
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:05,189
targeting so they were targeted when

780
00:34:02,889 --> 00:34:08,440
they turned pakistan they compromised

781
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:10,839
websites that were already in pakistan

782
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:12,730
and then host the documents there this

783
00:34:10,839 --> 00:34:14,949
gave them some plausibility and added

784
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:16,960
another layer of ossification it also

785
00:34:14,949 --> 00:34:20,668
got around some of the geofencing that

786
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:22,990
you might see in a typical environment

787
00:34:20,668 --> 00:34:25,989
and i think in some ways even more

788
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:27,790
interesting than the indian state

789
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:29,949
sponsored activity would be the indian

790
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:31,869
hacking for hire the two main names that

791
00:34:29,949 --> 00:34:34,299
come to mind that have been publicly

792
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:35,919
reported our app insecurity and then the

793
00:34:34,299 --> 00:34:38,319
second one just broke this week was

794
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:41,109
finalizing science but was dark basing

795
00:34:38,319 --> 00:34:43,029
by citizen lab both operations have

796
00:34:41,109 --> 00:34:44,799
targeted variety of individuals

797
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:48,159
including attorneys dissidents and

798
00:34:44,799 --> 00:34:51,690
journalists vff reported that operation

799
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:54,160
Manuel was in use by a variety of

800
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:57,070
organizations including those from

801
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,930
Kazakhstan and then the campaign that

802
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:02,260
led to the ties to dark Oracle from

803
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:03,460
Lebanon dark basin on the other hand

804
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:05,200
seem to have two different types of

805
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:08,080
campaigns that was reported by Reuters

806
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:10,270
and sis and lab the first seem to be

807
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:12,069
more aggressive trying to force the used

808
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:15,040
or unsubscribe so they just stopped

809
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:16,810
getting the emails it's loud it's noisy

810
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:20,050
but it seemed to work

811
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:22,750
I've just consistently pounding spam

812
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:24,640
emails sometimes pornographic content in

813
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:26,740
order to try just get the users I just

814
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:30,339
I'm done gotta click unsubscribe like

815
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:32,160
get me off of this list the other was

816
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:34,440
more targeted and masqueraded as

817
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:37,390
legitimate service maybe Google photos

818
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:40,570
and was targeted to the individual users

819
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:42,359
and said hey please share this photo

820
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:45,610
album with me whatever it looks like

821
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:49,450
definitely more targeted than we had

822
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:51,790
seen past so if you're interested in

823
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:55,810
following a PT's there's a bunch of

824
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:58,029
researchers that post hashes and malware

825
00:35:55,810 --> 00:36:00,640
samples on twitter if you search for a

826
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:02,520
hashtag Sidewinder you'll start getting

827
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:07,870
a variety of malware samples to look at

828
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:09,490
really interesting stuff so next we have

829
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:11,670
these beautiful mountains these

830
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:16,660
mountains are actually from South Korea

831
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:18,610
so I think one of the South Korea's one

832
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:20,529
of most interesting threat countries

833
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:23,320
from my point of view we'll talk about

834
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:27,400
to the first is hey Yassa it's been

835
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:29,920
active since 2016 turian includes China

836
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:33,700
North Korea Japan Nepal Singapore Russia

837
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:38,230
Poland and Switzerland it's interesting

838
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:40,689
because their capabilities include a

839
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:43,330
keylogger outlook credential harvester

840
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:45,100
and then ghost rat what's interesting

841
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:48,160
about PAGASA is that they typically

842
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:51,850
their fishing comes around the holidays

843
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:53,410
and offers blessings or thanks to people

844
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:55,210
so it's more it was all those ecards

845
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:58,870
that we used to get saying hey happy

846
00:36:55,210 --> 00:37:01,450
holidays from the Smith family similar

847
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:03,440
technique especially focused though on

848
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:09,618
North Korean holidays as well

849
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:11,599
which is interesting there's sorry the

850
00:37:09,619 --> 00:37:15,349
other thing new thing about this group

851
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:17,810
is that they are able to fish very

852
00:37:15,349 --> 00:37:20,210
quickly relate to the new so in some

853
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:21,770
days and sometimes less than four days

854
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:24,670
after news broke it was already being

855
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:26,300
used in lures for fishing another

856
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:29,740
campaign that they were doing that

857
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:33,079
prevailing on mentioned was

858
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:34,970
correspondent to the release of a new

859
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:39,050
software so the company those being

860
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:41,660
spooked the actor had already prepared a

861
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:44,480
campaign and then sent out that campaign

862
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:46,640
the same day that the released a new

863
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,829
software so we don't know if it's

864
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,660
coincidence or they or they just got

865
00:37:48,829 --> 00:37:52,160
lucky or they were planning ahead time

866
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:55,549
but either way it's very convincing when

867
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:58,098
you can get brand-new news and fresh

868
00:37:55,550 --> 00:38:01,670
articles into the hands of users into

869
00:37:58,099 --> 00:38:03,560
their inboxes for attribution for this

870
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:06,740
set interesting because it comes from

871
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:08,000
both time stamps meaning working hours

872
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:10,069
and and yes

873
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,410
that can always be changed based off of

874
00:38:10,069 --> 00:38:15,200
how many people work nights but for the

875
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:16,460
most part it's a good baseline the

876
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,899
interesting thing is there was an

877
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:21,050
artifact left in some of the malware

878
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:23,450
that reference never calm which is

879
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:27,109
Korea's biggest search engine and that

880
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:29,569
was in one of the documents in in the

881
00:38:27,109 --> 00:38:32,720
document field so that helps with

882
00:38:29,569 --> 00:38:35,180
attribution for this set dark hotel also

883
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:37,720
known as shadow crane is one of my

884
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:41,770
favorite apts they've been active since

885
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:43,879
2007 in 2014 Kim Zetter

886
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:46,579
reported on the hotel attacks against

887
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:51,290
some VIPs specifically on high-profile

888
00:38:46,579 --> 00:38:53,180
guests so what happened there was the

889
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:55,040
actors were already on the Wi-Fi and

890
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:57,169
once the individual that they were

891
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,509
targeting logged on they were targeted

892
00:38:57,170 --> 00:39:01,640
saying hey your Adobe needs to be

893
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:05,200
updated and then they download of course

894
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:05,200
the fake update that then gave them

895
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:08,720
access to the targets computer so

896
00:39:06,829 --> 00:39:10,369
interesting they had a kernel level key

897
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:13,129
logger they use zero days in their

898
00:39:10,369 --> 00:39:17,630
spearfishing over all their campaigns

899
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:19,369
they used HT a downloaders consistently

900
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:23,660
so that's one of the TTP that they were

901
00:39:19,369 --> 00:39:28,099
known for another TTP that they are

902
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:29,930
known for was consistent fishing so you

903
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:31,819
may not accept that attachment when it

904
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:33,109
first comes in February but if you keep

905
00:39:31,819 --> 00:39:36,200
getting the same conference on the same

906
00:39:33,109 --> 00:39:37,730
person in March April May by May and say

907
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,649
this is just a normal thing and your

908
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:44,150
defenses are down and then you're more

909
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:46,670
likely to open that attachment as part

910
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:48,559
of that specific campaign they also

911
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:50,930
configured their C two pages to look

912
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:52,779
like normal web pages if you visit the

913
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:55,308
wrong page so if you just browse to it

914
00:39:52,779 --> 00:39:57,829
you know web browser Kaspersky reported

915
00:39:55,309 --> 00:40:00,680
you'd often see pictures of artists

916
00:39:57,829 --> 00:40:03,500
artisanal ice cream or other comics

917
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:05,509
completely related unrelated to their

918
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:08,210
target I'm sort of trying to increase

919
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:12,680
that OPSEC especially when researchers

920
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:16,849
come and poke around the site and the

921
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:20,480
group has used plenty of 0 days in this

922
00:40:16,849 --> 00:40:22,339
last spring Kaspersky released released

923
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:25,460
a report talking about dark hotel using

924
00:40:22,339 --> 00:40:27,259
Internet Explorer vulnerability the

925
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:29,630
interesting thing about this report was

926
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:32,869
that some targets appeared to be geo

927
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:34,579
located to South Korea at this time it's

928
00:40:32,869 --> 00:40:37,130
unclear whether or not they belong to

929
00:40:34,579 --> 00:40:39,920
multinational companies or actual South

930
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:42,260
Korean citizens it would be consistent

931
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,970
if South Korean geopolitical Ames

932
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:46,400
solicited information for most companies

933
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:48,618
that we competitors so hey you're a

934
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:52,160
multinational company your south korean

935
00:40:48,619 --> 00:40:55,490
branch gets fished to help advance the

936
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:58,308
South Korean state Nexus really excited

937
00:40:55,490 --> 00:41:04,368
about this next picture because it's

938
00:40:58,309 --> 00:41:07,900
it's beautiful yes that is a buffalo and

939
00:41:04,369 --> 00:41:14,380
that's right we're going to Vietnam

940
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:16,509
so Vietnam interesting target abt 32 but

941
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:17,890
ocean Lotus it's really interesting

942
00:41:16,509 --> 00:41:19,720
because with the right visibility it's

943
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:21,910
easy to see how their campaigns aligned

944
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:24,160
with their state interests Nick Carr

945
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:26,828
formerly of fire and now with Microsoft

946
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:30,279
I did a great job of reporting what fire

947
00:41:26,829 --> 00:41:32,859
I saw so first they saw socialists have

948
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:37,150
been active since 2014 they first

949
00:41:32,859 --> 00:41:39,098
publicly talked about in 2017 ocean

950
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:41,230
Lotus targeted foreign corporations with

951
00:41:39,099 --> 00:41:43,990
manufacturing consumer products and

952
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:45,249
hospitality sectors they also in

953
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:47,439
different campaigns targeted the

954
00:41:45,249 --> 00:41:48,910
Vietnamese jaspera journalists and

955
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:54,160
activists on with the government

956
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:57,549
agencies and then so what's interesting

957
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:59,348
with this is that it's not so straight

958
00:41:57,549 --> 00:42:01,240
intellectual property theft so what

959
00:41:59,349 --> 00:42:04,720
they're serving sort of a law

960
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:06,970
enforcement audit purpose so Nick Carr

961
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:08,649
gives this example of auto manufacturing

962
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:12,339
so Vietnam implemented strict

963
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:13,960
regulations on how to import cars and

964
00:42:12,339 --> 00:42:15,970
following those laws being enacted

965
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:18,819
multiple car manufacturers including

966
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:20,488
Toyota and BMW with an attacked and late

967
00:42:18,819 --> 00:42:22,538
twenty men team by Ocean Lotus

968
00:42:20,489 --> 00:42:24,160
oftentimes these attacks came right

969
00:42:22,539 --> 00:42:26,200
after those car manufacturers had just

970
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:30,359
been meeting with the government so

971
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:30,359
really unique targeting there

972
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:35,348
additionally we see that when we talk

973
00:42:32,769 --> 00:42:36,488
about investment data they may not be

974
00:42:35,349 --> 00:42:37,869
targeting the direct company that's

975
00:42:36,489 --> 00:42:39,789
investing in Vietnam but they'll target

976
00:42:37,869 --> 00:42:41,499
the accountants that are helping that

977
00:42:39,789 --> 00:42:46,660
company so we're sort of that third

978
00:42:41,499 --> 00:42:49,238
party targeting we also see Ocean Lotus

979
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:51,249
or apt 32 conducting targets against

980
00:42:49,239 --> 00:42:54,549
government sponsored or government

981
00:42:51,249 --> 00:42:56,470
organizations mostly located regionally

982
00:42:54,549 --> 00:42:59,319
according to the e FF they've also been

983
00:42:56,470 --> 00:43:01,779
known to target journalists activists we

984
00:42:59,319 --> 00:43:03,788
talk about the diaspora when a same

985
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:05,739
thing is that Ocean Lotus either on

986
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:07,299
accident or on purpose leaked

987
00:43:05,739 --> 00:43:09,309
transcripts between the Philippine

988
00:43:07,299 --> 00:43:12,640
president with world leaders and clean

989
00:43:09,309 --> 00:43:13,960
both the Chinese in the US presence can

990
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,910
they upload those two virus whole

991
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:18,640
whether or not that was intentional

992
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:20,399
amount we don't know but something is

993
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:23,430
she to look at

994
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:25,519
so when we talk about Vietnam it's also

995
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:27,629
important to talk about phantom lanes

996
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:29,910
phantom Lancer was just reported a few

997
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:33,420
months ago and does share some overlap

998
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:36,029
with Ocean Lotus Kaspersky estimated

999
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:38,609
that they've been active since 2016 they

1000
00:43:36,029 --> 00:43:40,529
serve as mobile Mauer and the

1001
00:43:38,609 --> 00:43:43,109
interesting things that they do the

1002
00:43:40,529 --> 00:43:45,029
first when they first upload now which

1003
00:43:43,109 --> 00:43:48,269
the Play Store it's clean so it's just a

1004
00:43:45,029 --> 00:43:53,009
regular app but then subsequent updates

1005
00:43:48,269 --> 00:43:55,950
is when they end up contain malicious

1006
00:43:53,009 --> 00:43:57,539
payloads in code some of their targets

1007
00:43:55,950 --> 00:44:01,759
include India Bangladesh Vietnam

1008
00:43:57,539 --> 00:44:04,229
Indonesia Nepal Myanmar and Malaysia

1009
00:44:01,759 --> 00:44:07,049
again just interesting mobile malware

1010
00:44:04,229 --> 00:44:10,379
campaign there are some overlaps as far

1011
00:44:07,049 --> 00:44:13,140
as infrastructure goes with apt 32 Ocean

1012
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:16,979
Lotus but not enough to conclusively

1013
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:21,808
tell them together so our last good

1014
00:44:16,979 --> 00:44:25,649
actor for today yeah is in locating

1015
00:44:21,809 --> 00:44:28,829
Latin America and goes by machete it's

1016
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:31,170
possibly Colombia Venezuela the it's

1017
00:44:28,829 --> 00:44:33,960
been active since 2010 revamped

1018
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:35,609
infrastructure in 2012 it is a

1019
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:39,989
spanish-speaking apt which is

1020
00:44:35,609 --> 00:44:42,269
interesting and they look for photos

1021
00:44:39,989 --> 00:44:43,710
from webcams geo locations audio for

1022
00:44:42,269 --> 00:44:47,209
microphones sort of all those things

1023
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:49,499
that you'd want in an espionage set

1024
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:52,410
victims from Venezuela Colombia Ecuador

1025
00:44:49,499 --> 00:44:53,999
and Russia so this is hard because when

1026
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:57,749
we talked about usually using victims to

1027
00:44:53,999 --> 00:45:00,299
help cluster and help do attribution if

1028
00:44:57,749 --> 00:45:04,890
you have a lot of victims in the same

1029
00:45:00,299 --> 00:45:07,259
country as that's or originating the set

1030
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:09,900
it makes that a lot harder to do against

1031
00:45:07,259 --> 00:45:13,499
and shooting set because primarily in

1032
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:14,880
spanish-speaking so just the correcto

1033
00:45:13,499 --> 00:45:19,589
and then mush up there are two of us

1034
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:21,779
finish being a PT's that we've seen so

1035
00:45:19,589 --> 00:45:22,859
so what so let's talk about trends that

1036
00:45:21,779 --> 00:45:24,900
we've seen the action has been doing

1037
00:45:22,859 --> 00:45:27,319
we've talked about a lot of adversaries

1038
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:29,999
there's there's more out there and I'm

1039
00:45:27,319 --> 00:45:32,279
not an expert on all of them by any

1040
00:45:29,999 --> 00:45:33,399
means but I think we've seen that it's

1041
00:45:32,279 --> 00:45:35,440
evident that

1042
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:38,560
smaller governments are using cyber

1043
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,900
capabilities and they're using these apt

1044
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:43,390
style attacks on dissidents journalists

1045
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:45,730
and sometimes our own citizens if you

1046
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:46,720
have employees or friends in these

1047
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:48,940
groups please make sure they're

1048
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:50,500
protected google advanced protection

1049
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:52,660
programs now free and open to everyone

1050
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:56,320
get a hardware token and get them to

1051
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:58,870
work definitely worth looking at and I

1052
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:01,000
think as defenders if we're working in a

1053
00:45:58,870 --> 00:46:02,680
multinational company when was the last

1054
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,540
time that you threat modeled the

1055
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:06,129
multitude of government's they may

1056
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:08,080
affect your operations do you have

1057
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:10,240
operations in South America that may

1058
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:12,970
have local offices targeted by machete

1059
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:15,149
do you do business in Vietnam or South

1060
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:17,500
Korea so that's only shed water though

1061
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:20,290
sometimes you may not you may be a u.s.

1062
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:23,080
us-based company that doesn't have any

1063
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:25,600
interests or high profile VIPs traveling

1064
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:28,950
and this threat this talk may not be

1065
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:33,460
directly useful for you and that's okay

1066
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:34,960
but it's important to identify what

1067
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:37,180
threats affect your company especially

1068
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:39,880
if your multinational one of the best

1069
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:43,690
ways to do that is to look at regional

1070
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:45,190
security companies so outside the great

1071
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:47,920
fire and Crosstrek are great but their

1072
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:49,060
visibility is delimited looking and

1073
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,610
talking to some of those smaller

1074
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:56,440
companies whether they be based in

1075
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:59,350
Europe or China or Asia Asia it's

1076
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:01,210
important to get that full visibility um

1077
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:03,370
and I guess the other thing is if you've

1078
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:07,120
seen unique regional targeting please

1079
00:47:03,370 --> 00:47:08,859
share it blog about it tweet about it do

1080
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:11,259
talk about it we want to see that

1081
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:13,930
regional visibility that we might not

1082
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:14,980
see from the America and it's really

1083
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:17,120
interesting because while these

1084
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:20,630
directors are doing some cool stuff

1085
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:23,060
so last then all the images were from

1086
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:24,770
pixabay citation reached all of the

1087
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:27,799
research that I've talked about is

1088
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:30,290
located on paceman also posts that link

1089
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:32,780
in the discord as well as answer any

1090
00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:35,440
questions feel free to scan the QR code

1091
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:38,110
if you also want to go that pastebin

1092
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:40,190
site to look at all of that research

1093
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:41,360
there's a lot of really good work being

1094
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:43,880
done and the researchers did a great job

1095
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:45,920
documenting it from a variety of vendors

1096
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:50,600
so please go look at those sources of

1097
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:53,990
anything I said make sense that's all I

1098
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:55,610
have thank you and I'll be around I'll
