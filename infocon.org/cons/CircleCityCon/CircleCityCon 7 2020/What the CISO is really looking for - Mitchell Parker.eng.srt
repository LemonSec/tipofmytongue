5
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:37,780
so good afternoon everyone thank you all

6
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:41,809
for attending today

7
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:44,710
so like I said as soon as I can get over

8
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:47,660
to my next slide why are we here today

9
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:49,850
there's a disconnect with hackers and

10
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:53,000
security management it's really hurting

11
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:55,820
us and a lot of the CISO is coming out

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,640
now they don't really have a security

13
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:00,290
background you get a lot of X big for a

14
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,989
lot of people the counting backgrounds

15
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:07,160
taking this role a lot and it's

16
00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:09,610
different and I'm gonna be very clear

17
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:12,530
about a couple ground rules

18
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:16,610
number one I'm gonna promise you a BS

19
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:19,340
free experience without some meaningless

20
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:22,370
motivational story and I'm also not

21
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:26,360
gonna give you the recycled motivational

22
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:28,370
porn that people are passing off as any

23
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,080
kind of learning materials that are

24
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:37,220
being used to keep people in line these

25
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:39,650
days I like it is so what the hell did I

26
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:42,408
get myself into this is my introduction

27
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:44,720
I was not on the management track by any

28
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:46,700
means most of my co-workers in my

29
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,270
consulting company did not like me very

30
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:51,830
much and I had a lot of problems there I

31
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:54,048
was a special consultant that was doing

32
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:56,539
databases and security I didn't want to

33
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:59,140
have life cycle anymore and quite

34
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:03,259
frankly he was dealing with and

35
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:05,119
management aka somebody who was an MBA

36
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:08,449
that got brought in to run an ia program

37
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,190
who was pretty much destroying the ia

38
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:12,709
program I worked at on the governor

39
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:14,600
consulting engagement and my other

40
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:18,260
customer was toxic with leadership

41
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:21,980
issues so I got a call from their system

42
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:23,230
anyway and came right out and said the

43
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,768
only time I would ever consider

44
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,940
interviewing with you as if you're

45
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:27,290
actually committed to having cultural

46
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,859
change because there's no way I'm

47
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:31,600
working for you now

48
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,940
two days later got an email from the CIO

49
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,310
asking about an interview which I had

50
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:39,460
the next week in his office I was

51
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:41,440
actually surprised today my second

52
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:44,490
interview I wasn't surprised to see the

53
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:48,460
CISO decided to resign the very next

54
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:50,590
literally ripped for the interview and I

55
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:52,990
proceeded to tell the CIO when I found

56
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,730
out I said you make me work for any of

57
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:58,270
these people I named three people I said

58
00:02:54,730 --> 00:03:00,399
I will walk out on the spot he told me I

59
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:03,640
wouldn't have that problem later I found

60
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:07,209
out guy was a psychometrician he's a

61
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:09,390
specialized psychologist that is focused

62
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:13,120
on designing psychological evaluations

63
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:15,820
instruments so after nine months of

64
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,030
interviews with him including at least

65
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:21,670
one question and take home assignment

66
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:24,760
were actually walked in and said this is

67
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:28,570
a goddamn travesty art I'm gonna put a

68
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:30,399
job I was going for an architect job I

69
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:32,350
ended up with the CISO role what the

70
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:37,480
hell did I get myself into that's pretty

71
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:39,880
much the best way to put it up so I will

72
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,560
tell you what I learned the first thing

73
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:45,130
I learned is that we overestimate the

74
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:48,880
maturity of adults and I say this

75
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:52,329
because I have I am the parent of five

76
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:55,930
year old twins I have never seen or

77
00:03:52,330 --> 00:04:00,610
never thought I would see grown-ups act

78
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:06,160
like my children until I took on my

79
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:07,930
first cícero and also besides fact I

80
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,650
actually watched a grown man who's now

81
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:13,450
grandfather throw a tantrum in my face I

82
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:15,070
watched people have negative responses

83
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,870
when vendors told them things they

84
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:19,659
didn't like and cut pretty much the same

85
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:21,519
kind of response also one other thing

86
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:24,220
from my vantage point there's a lot they

87
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,990
don't tell you there's no light eel

88
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,820
juice like book of handbook for the

89
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:31,450
recently deceased for becoming

90
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:34,680
management's most management has the

91
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:36,310
fillet loyalty of a den of snakes and

92
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,110
realistically they don't care about

93
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,880
their golf buddies frat brothers or

94
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:42,340
classmates or cohort mates from school

95
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,760
like they talk to you about especially

96
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,560
in college I talk about

97
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,200
why should you join a fraternity and

98
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,520
recent being Oh paternity brothers

99
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:54,469
working all over the place and get you

100
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,940
jobs doesn't work that way be very clear

101
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,770
about something most people and upper

102
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:00,440
management care about one person and one

103
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:01,909
person only themselves and this is

104
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,730
especially true for those couple layers

105
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:06,740
of management red blue C Suite C suite

106
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:10,130
in general it's pretty awesome people

107
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:13,580
are great and to be very very very blunt

108
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:15,740
they look at what the even below them do

109
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:19,250
and laugh at them for trying to be so

110
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:20,510
manipulative to get ahead because those

111
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:24,470
people that are manipulative and

112
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:30,110
self-centered realistically never make

113
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:32,990
it in the field and I will also tell you

114
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:34,510
one other fallacy the fallacy of someone

115
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:38,480
being given a choice

116
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:40,610
if someone is from executive levels let

117
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:43,160
go from an organization and you hear the

118
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:47,560
wording they were given a choice they

119
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:50,680
weren't I have handled more executive

120
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:55,450
lack of a better from firings over the

121
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:58,040
past twelve years then I dare to mention

122
00:05:55,450 --> 00:06:01,610
no one has given a choice there's no

123
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:04,760
other way to put it so what's the agenda

124
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:05,840
not Eve heard a lot of this stuff we're

125
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,670
gonna talk about where this role really

126
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:11,210
came from in health care and finance and

127
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:13,460
the roles that spyware malware and virus

128
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:17,690
I'm sharing playing with it talk about

129
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:20,270
DoD talk about NIST policies one of our

130
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:22,930
risk assessments high-tech business

131
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:25,700
associates a/k/a that contract effect

132
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:28,850
training and realistically what's that

133
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:31,159
and yes you have to do a risk management

134
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:32,530
plan moving on from there we're going to

135
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,660
talk about following up with vendors

136
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:37,039
data loss prevention and PCI which is

137
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:39,160
the intersection of business and

138
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:42,410
security smartphones in the cloud

139
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:44,960
privacy who is a charm why do I need to

140
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:47,840
know them why does HR I need to know

141
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,090
about what we do and I'm gonna talk a

142
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,169
little bit about ransomware

143
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:53,599
because that sums up everything pretty

144
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:55,220
nicely and talk about how we evolved and

145
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,550
then come to some pretty awesome

146
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:59,870
conclusions so

147
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:01,939
what else are we gonna do we're gonna

148
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,979
discuss what these are and we're gonna

149
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:05,449
discuss where and when and how we need

150
00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:08,419
hackers to help out in the dressing up

151
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:12,099
because we need your help and to be very

152
00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:15,169
clear there is no both sides or red pill

153
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:18,969
whoever tells you these words has an

154
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:21,409
agenda you don't want to go there and

155
00:07:18,969 --> 00:07:25,180
their agenda is to keep things the way

156
00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:28,669
they are because they're benefiting from

157
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:30,680
their not doing anything and I'll be

158
00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:32,299
very clear about one other thing I work

159
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:36,340
with one of the biggest scumbags in the

160
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:40,099
IT industry at one of my previous jobs

161
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:41,810
he was playing about this same manager

162
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:44,690
give you an idea of how much of a

163
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:46,280
scumbag he was when my wife and I were

164
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:48,710
looking to move to Elkins Park

165
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:51,229
Pennsylvania proceeded to tell me in no

166
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:53,628
uncertain terms that if I decided to

167
00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:55,490
have kids I should maybe not move to

168
00:07:53,629 --> 00:07:57,550
Elkins Park because of the large amount

169
00:07:55,490 --> 00:08:00,500
of black people

170
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:04,039
needless to say he didn't realize what

171
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:05,449
ethnicity my wife is and let's just say

172
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:07,610
I was very happy when he walked out the

173
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:12,139
door two weeks later cuz he was on the

174
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:14,199
way out anyway but yeah you will deal

175
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:20,150
with a lot of people like that nacinda

176
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:22,729
said the same so where did this come

177
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:25,638
from so the health information

178
00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:27,409
Portability Accountability Act requires

179
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:28,849
that organizations actually appoint an

180
00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:34,279
information security officer it's

181
00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:35,779
federal law so 45 CFR 164 308 a to the

182
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:39,769
only time you'll ever hear me say that

183
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:40,909
is in limits of lawyers so they're

184
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,500
responsible for the design and

185
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:44,870
implementation of policies and

186
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:47,690
procedures for the covered entity or

187
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:51,079
business associate so it's an assigned

188
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:52,449
role and in finance the federal

189
00:08:51,079 --> 00:08:56,689
financial institutions examination

190
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:58,729
Council SDF fiac better known as the

191
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:00,380
organization that provides the oversight

192
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:03,769
and on guidance for every financial

193
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:06,920
institution now for acquire one that

194
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:09,800
comes out RIT handbook section 1a to see

195
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:12,819
a little different from

196
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:15,439
everyone else is that FFIEC requires

197
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:19,189
that the CISO be independent from IT

198
00:09:15,439 --> 00:09:22,040
operations and the recommended residual

199
00:09:19,189 --> 00:09:25,790
structure the FFIEC and federal banking

200
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:28,910
system have requires a chief risk

201
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:32,738
officer so usually in finance your CISO

202
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:35,360
will report to the chief risk officer

203
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:39,470
because of the required and pennis from

204
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:41,589
IT operations so what's really happens

205
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:44,119
so we know all these nice federal breaks

206
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:46,249
in health care if you can actually spell

207
00:09:44,119 --> 00:09:47,629
it and you can actually speak well and

208
00:09:46,249 --> 00:09:50,959
not embarrass themselves in front of the

209
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:52,879
c-suite usually get the role financed

210
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:57,040
this goes to one of your ex auditors

211
00:09:52,879 --> 00:10:01,009
from big four or strong technologist and

212
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:03,049
recent being is because organizations

213
00:10:01,009 --> 00:10:05,779
pay too big for millions of millions of

214
00:10:03,049 --> 00:10:07,699
dollars to tell them what to do and to

215
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:10,639
help provide audit and strategy guidance

216
00:10:07,699 --> 00:10:13,878
on security so usually they get these

217
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:16,490
kinds of roles so FFIEC and finance

218
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:19,910
they have great guns strong guns I would

219
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:22,160
say best in any industry health care

220
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:26,209
definitely doesn't which is why we're

221
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,410
here today so give a little bit of

222
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:30,829
history I've been doing the security

223
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:34,189
about eighteen years and talk about how

224
00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:35,049
security was before spyware malware and

225
00:10:34,189 --> 00:10:38,149
file-sharing

226
00:10:35,049 --> 00:10:41,119
so people fought three things number one

227
00:10:38,149 --> 00:10:42,499
the firewall protect it all and that you

228
00:10:41,119 --> 00:10:45,049
only needed an audit at once a year

229
00:10:42,499 --> 00:10:47,480
number two no one cared about the audits

230
00:10:45,049 --> 00:10:50,420
and number three antivirus actually

231
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,699
works so a little thing happened about

232
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:56,868
17 years ago and we call that Casa

233
00:10:52,699 --> 00:11:00,368
better known as the file sharing program

234
00:10:56,869 --> 00:11:03,079
from the people that then it's Skype and

235
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:06,739
they had a very good distributing

236
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:09,378
network technology basically designed to

237
00:11:06,739 --> 00:11:12,350
get past these centralized Napster

238
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:14,720
servers you remember us from back in the

239
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:17,149
day that Metallica sued over

240
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,129
so what happened is a lot of people sub

241
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:21,209
Casa and other file-sharing programs on

242
00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:24,149
their computers at work

243
00:11:21,209 --> 00:11:26,040
so order computers at home so one

244
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:30,749
important case I always remember is a

245
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:32,490
postal service employee installing this

246
00:11:30,749 --> 00:11:35,459
on their work computer that contain

247
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:37,470
confidential HR data at the time there

248
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:40,589
was a big popular band called the Postal

249
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:43,259
Service so instead of getting mp3s of

250
00:11:40,589 --> 00:11:45,869
your favorite band you were getting the

251
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:48,209
employee discipline records from a US

252
00:11:45,869 --> 00:11:51,899
Postal post-office British somewhere in

253
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:55,290
Midwest lots people had credit card info

254
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:57,540
lots of people had adult content show up

255
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:59,339
because Casa was people were picking

256
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,569
their My Documents folder to share and

257
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:03,600
they didn't realize I shared everything

258
00:12:00,569 --> 00:12:05,579
underneath and for a lot of middle-aged

259
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,220
men back then they're hidden porn stash

260
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:09,689
folders also got shown on the inner so

261
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,009
you learned a lot more about your

262
00:12:09,689 --> 00:12:11,660
friends and family and you care to

263
00:12:11,009 --> 00:12:15,269
mention

264
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:17,699
so what out there what else happened is

265
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:18,949
is to make money off of this because you

266
00:12:17,699 --> 00:12:22,439
weren't making money selling music

267
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:24,990
people were putting spyware malware and

268
00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:29,099
all sorts of other fun things as bundles

269
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:30,740
with I'll sharing software so PC started

270
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:34,799
getting wrecked by spyware and

271
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:36,029
advertisements and bonzi buddy people

272
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:39,629
started getting really concerned about

273
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:41,699
that so people actually realize they

274
00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:43,439
have to do something and security

275
00:12:41,699 --> 00:12:45,059
started getting empowered to buy

276
00:12:43,439 --> 00:12:47,459
solutions to fix these problems because

277
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:49,529
quite frankly you're not gonna be able

278
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:54,179
to turn on a patient in a hospital bonzi

279
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:56,879
buddy keeps showing up so this started

280
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:58,769
what we call our arms race because when

281
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:00,240
people started fixing these issues there

282
00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:02,939
were a lot of other ones they started

283
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,699
realizing existed my favorites are

284
00:13:02,939 --> 00:13:09,689
buffer overflows memory corruption not

285
00:13:05,699 --> 00:13:11,248
patching especially due to the 2003

286
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:14,129
wealthy attack that took down the US

287
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:16,379
Navy and ancient legacy apps and

288
00:13:14,129 --> 00:13:17,790
security holes so everything started

289
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:21,389
becoming fair game

290
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:23,699
people realized hey maybe the AV package

291
00:13:21,389 --> 00:13:25,319
I bought isn't doing the job or maybe

292
00:13:23,699 --> 00:13:28,799
that firewall isn't doing the job either

293
00:13:25,319 --> 00:13:30,430
if someone can get Caza behind it so

294
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:32,560
case in point

295
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:34,589
that whole Navy attack DoD started

296
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,849
before signior security guidelines and

297
00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:39,690
DISA started developing and enforcing

298
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:41,950
the Stig's a.k system technical

299
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:44,110
implementations guides in earnest

300
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:45,310
whereas before they were updated maybe

301
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:47,410
once a year they started seeing a lot

302
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:50,229
more updates they set the standards

303
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:52,870
others followed the FFIEC followed suit

304
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:54,990
and HIPAA then established security and

305
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:58,390
privacy rules to set security standards

306
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:59,950
followed by the high tech Act in 2013

307
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:02,819
which is where the breach notification

308
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:05,320
rule comes from aka

309
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,580
when you see that news report saying

310
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,810
another health care provider got

311
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:13,029
ransomware in records were breached 2013

312
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:16,329
and of course there's NIST they created

313
00:14:13,029 --> 00:14:18,310
special publication 800-53 vision one

314
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:19,839
the introductory resource guide for

315
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:22,000
implementing the health insurance

316
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,430
portability kind ability Act security

317
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,690
law and quite frankly it has not been

318
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:28,510
touched since and so as I haven't

319
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:30,580
retracted it's this government this

320
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:32,610
document provides more of the same if

321
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:35,560
you've been a defense contractor and you

322
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:38,950
basically want to turn security into an

323
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:40,750
exercise of what tend to use to check

324
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:43,300
the box to make sure that upper

325
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:45,520
management understands what you're doing

326
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:48,849
so the general could sign on the dotted

327
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:50,970
line so your system can go live by

328
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:53,800
accepting the risks read this document

329
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:54,940
by all means you will not learn anything

330
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,290
about security from this document

331
00:14:54,940 --> 00:15:00,130
however you will learn absolutely

332
00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:02,230
nothing now you want to know what to do

333
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:05,680
and why we need your help please go to

334
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:07,270
the next slide if not stop here sorry I

335
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:11,589
didn't have the awesome cheesier an

336
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:12,850
adventure mean here so some policies

337
00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:15,459
what are those

338
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:17,470
so according to dictionary.com a policy

339
00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:21,930
is a definite course of action adopted

340
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:24,870
for the sake of expediency etc and

341
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:26,560
brings someone who's been in my role I

342
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:28,209
don't see it's something that people

343
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,209
follow when it doesn't get in their way

344
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:33,310
it is a well-documented set of abstract

345
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:35,649
procedures that define the course of

346
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:37,959
action organizations should take however

347
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:39,630
it's really hard to provide compliance

348
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:43,920
with

349
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:46,620
so tell you a funny story I four years

350
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,569
ago I was presenting to the CFO of my

351
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:52,410
last job and his management team which

352
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:56,220
included my boss on what the policies

353
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:58,949
were and I presented on the six core

354
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,540
policies and board documents that made

355
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:02,670
up the information requirements for the

356
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:05,880
information security program CFL stops

357
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:09,300
me goes hey man I've been working here

358
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:14,160
for 35 years I don't know what half of

359
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:16,410
these effing policies are a policy is

360
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,380
only as good as the people that

361
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:21,750
understand what it is and why you're

362
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:24,450
doing it so to get an answer like that

363
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:25,620
from a member to c-suite tell told me

364
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:28,200
everything I need to know my policy

365
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:34,800
communication in that place okay it

366
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:36,630
wasn't happening so how can we use to

367
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,609
have her mind set we need to think of

368
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:40,290
how to determine if our security

369
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:42,660
policies are being followed and devised

370
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:45,270
tests based upon actual policy

371
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:48,089
compliance because it's a previous

372
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:51,510
example showed people aren't gonna

373
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:53,040
follow it because it's on paper they

374
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:56,240
most likely aren't and then there's no

375
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:58,709
way for them to trace policies or

376
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,740
compliance with it they think they're

377
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:03,030
gonna get away with it there's a lot of

378
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:06,770
people out there to have the fallacy of

379
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:09,930
thinkin because it's written down that's

380
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:13,319
it's gonna be followed and the truth is

381
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:16,250
is that it's not I'm really sad to say

382
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:18,480
that but again previously example shows

383
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:20,250
we have to find ways to ensure

384
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,380
everything follow because just saying

385
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:24,480
you have a policy isn't enough and

386
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:27,510
having to appear in court over our

387
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:31,500
policies on that to that later tells you

388
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:32,370
you've really got to be sure what's the

389
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,050
risk

390
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:36,120
so I quoted the Department of Homeland

391
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:38,430
Security it's a process to identify

392
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:41,659
potential hazards and analyze what could

393
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:45,240
happen if a hazard actually occurs

394
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:47,790
however this is the government you go to

395
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,140
different branches according to CMS it's

396
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:51,149
a process by which an organization

397
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,830
checks to see if it's compliant with the

398
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:54,540
administrative technical and physical

399
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:57,030
security requirements of the HIPAA

400
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:58,920
Security Rule and helps determine where

401
00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:03,410
and when protected health information is

402
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:07,530
at risk so going on with the theme today

403
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:09,630
what do most organizations do and my

404
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:11,700
friends the underpants gnomes are here

405
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,620
to help me out what do they do is they

406
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:16,230
print out the HIPAA Security Rule or use

407
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:18,479
the CMS system readiness assessment tool

408
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:20,130
to verify their compliance check their

409
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,630
policies and procedures which we've just

410
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:24,240
proved that most people don't read

411
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:29,160
against HIPAA give themselves a clean

412
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:33,210
bill of health and profits so why do we

413
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:35,730
need the help and where do we get so we

414
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:37,710
need to have real tests and for the

415
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:38,940
system to store phj and then that works

416
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:41,970
themselves and test them for weaknesses

417
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:43,860
and incorporating those pen tests that

418
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:46,580
test for actual compliance is something

419
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:49,439
a lot of organizations just don't do

420
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:50,909
I've heard the words out of scope more

421
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,750
times in my career than I care to

422
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:56,460
mention and a lot of people do get

423
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:58,410
surprised when they get breached because

424
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,230
of these ancient systems that have good

425
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:03,360
operating policies and procedures

426
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:05,750
however they're running on unsupported

427
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,310
operating systems or ancient web apps

428
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:09,840
they think they're okay because they

429
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:12,530
check for a patch once a month then

430
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,730
write down they check for a patch well

431
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:16,830
sorry the last time the past came out

432
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:18,630
for Server 2003 and goes I want to cry

433
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:23,129
and the last time there's a patch for

434
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:26,970
Tomcat 5 I think a Commodore might have

435
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:30,150
been a viable computer so HIPAA and

436
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:31,920
other control sets they take the idea of

437
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:34,800
comes any controls like we just talked

438
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:36,480
about way too far so we need to address

439
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:38,970
real needs and instead of having a risk

440
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:42,300
assessment that just looks and our

441
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:44,750
policies and procedures actually this

442
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:47,840
has real tests in place to show whether

443
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:49,340
things compliant or not aka doing some

444
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,080
real work as opposed to interviewing

445
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:53,899
people and having them give you BS

446
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:57,020
answers you tell them the risk

447
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:58,370
assessments for a few years I need to

448
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:02,570
have real quantitative answers which

449
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:04,219
needs to develop that plan so brings me

450
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:05,659
to the next part which is high tech and

451
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:08,450
business associates or as I like to call

452
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:10,670
it the contract effect healthcare and

453
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:12,410
finance organizations are required to do

454
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:15,380
due diligence on vendors and their

455
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:16,940
business practices and under hi-tech you

456
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:19,070
know the other thing from the from the

457
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:21,350
final rule health care workers are

458
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:23,990
required to use business associate

459
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:25,580
agreements whose purpose is to set

460
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:28,160
reasonable terms and conditions for

461
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:29,780
securely storing a processing patient

462
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,610
data they're actually binding new

463
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:34,700
contracts basis of their other

464
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:36,850
responsibilities and liabilities when it

465
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:39,680
comes to protected health information

466
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:42,679
very few of them actually contain enjoin

467
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:46,190
InfoSec and very few are actually able

468
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:49,220
to be monitored or enforced I will tell

469
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:53,690
you try some of the stuff I've seen

470
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:54,470
NBA's drives me up a wall so what can we

471
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:57,980
do about it

472
00:20:54,470 --> 00:21:00,260
where do we need you so based on the

473
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:02,030
applications and services we have we

474
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:04,280
need to put some enforceable pentester

475
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:06,230
agreements in place and actually put

476
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,560
actually put some real security

477
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:11,950
standards into them which we've done

478
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:15,350
because I can't tell you it used to be

479
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:19,310
well Microsoft patches so let's change

480
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:21,199
format to hey we're on AWS doesn't

481
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:23,960
matter you need to make sure you have

482
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,970
real security standards and we need to

483
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:29,180
tell the other sis's what the real

484
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:32,240
threats are it's what's been happening

485
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:34,580
is that people think because it's in the

486
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:38,530
cloud and it's more secure and the truth

487
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:40,879
is is that it's not and that we are

488
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:44,000
outsourcing a ton of information without

489
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:46,670
good security terms and conditions or

490
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,240
the ability to enforce them I'll give

491
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:54,320
another case in point a lot of companies

492
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:56,370
over when this co vid pandemic started

493
00:21:54,320 --> 00:22:00,270
happening did not realize how much was

494
00:21:56,370 --> 00:22:02,489
out sourced until companies started

495
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:03,629
calling up their customers and saying

496
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:07,289
hey guess what

497
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:11,250
India's shut down we need to have our

498
00:22:07,289 --> 00:22:13,279
entire team work from home that has

499
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:16,260
happened to numerous companies and

500
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:21,980
having the ability to respond that I

501
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:23,940
type a scenario is not easy to have

502
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:26,700
because line ends up happening a lot of

503
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:28,409
customers don't think that their

504
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,899
companies are global companies and the

505
00:22:28,409 --> 00:22:34,860
truth is is that every company now is a

506
00:22:30,899 --> 00:22:36,418
global company so put in here that I

507
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:40,020
don't care if you had to have to hit

508
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:42,020
your sister up side the head buying yet

509
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:45,149
another product that claims to use AI

510
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:46,260
doesn't fix your issues finding out

511
00:22:45,149 --> 00:22:48,209
what's really going on and doing

512
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:51,600
something about it does and putting it

513
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:53,850
in contractual language does we've had

514
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,100
SQL injection since Bill Clinton was

515
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:58,439
president actually we've probably had us

516
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:00,389
as human Carter was president but the

517
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:03,330
difference is is they didn't connect

518
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:06,720
those and those NASA and Oracle or IBM

519
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:11,730
systems to be public internet back then

520
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:14,159
and AI doesn't fix your problems as so

521
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:16,320
much as it doesn't it so gives you a

522
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:20,010
whole brand-new set of problems to deal

523
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:22,918
with your set so disagrees my email

524
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:24,090
information signal and Twitter is

525
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:26,580
available at the end of this

526
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:27,750
presentation it's a whole new set of

527
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:31,860
problems and we've been doing some work

528
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:34,370
on that but again we have a problem of

529
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:38,039
people trying to gloss over problems and

530
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:40,668
which is a recurrent theme and we have

531
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:44,990
to be able to come up with plans to

532
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:47,990
address the actual needs that security

533
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,990
buyers

534
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:52,450
so brings me to trading so under

535
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:54,129
healthcare and finance

536
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:57,280
you're supposed to require regular and

537
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:59,260
relevant trading so HIPAA is more about

538
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,510
the security one information security

539
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:03,879
finance is about fraud prevention and

540
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:06,070
information security it's required to be

541
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:08,710
logged it's require it also requires a

542
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:11,310
QA instrument and I hate most of it and

543
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:13,240
I think it sucks

544
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:16,750
what is training sucks

545
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:20,680
I think this modern meme will provide

546
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:22,210
the good explanation most people don't

547
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:25,120
remember training and they'll go

548
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:30,520
outsource it to somebody else and the

549
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:33,520
money printer does go burr so be very

550
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:35,560
clear most systems by training from

551
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:40,060
companies that have no clue and who do

552
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:41,830
not understand healthcare and a lot of

553
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:44,320
organizations don't want to confront the

554
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:45,850
elephant BYOD and home internet usage

555
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,939
causing a lot of these security issues

556
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:51,790
and a lot of times it's because people

557
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:53,530
hide behind liability I had an entire

558
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:56,920
security program on the target beach

559
00:24:53,530 --> 00:25:00,340
scrapped because the chr over the place

560
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:02,770
I worked at did not want to be liable

561
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:05,470
for telling people hey you might want to

562
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:07,450
call your bank get your bank account

563
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:09,520
numbers changed and get your debit card

564
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:14,560
numbers change because likely you were

565
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:16,420
affected and Kovan 19 did not move the

566
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,649
meal much because what ended up

567
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:20,500
happening is people started

568
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:23,050
concentrating on things other than homes

569
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:25,720
internet security they cared about their

570
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:27,970
devices and that was it

571
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:29,530
meanwhile you're ignoring the fact that

572
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:31,990
all that traffic is going through

573
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:35,860
hundreds of thousands of routers many of

574
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:38,670
which can be easily owned so the advice

575
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:42,100
sucks so how do we make it not suck

576
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:44,440
first of all it's this is really tough

577
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:46,870
you've got to tell us so the emperor has

578
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,640
no clothes most of them don't get it at

579
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:50,290
first because they're gonna steadfastly

580
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,350
denied and they think their training is

581
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:55,330
great because certain people in the

582
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:56,310
security industry worked on it and it's

583
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:59,389
great

584
00:25:56,310 --> 00:26:01,980
and be very clear about something else

585
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:07,350
live demonstrations of why your training

586
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:10,590
does not work it's good why it doesn't

587
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:12,419
work but don't take it as far as doing

588
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:15,060
live demos and how to own something on

589
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:19,080
stage fight would happen that was really

590
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:22,139
funny I was at the hims 2017 conference

591
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:24,120
in Orlando and the CIO forum they had

592
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:27,240
the day before a conference had a very

593
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:29,729
famous where you could say it's actually

594
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:32,400
in his copyright speaker at the

595
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:34,500
conference and he gave this whole

596
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,210
demonstration of how nothing secure and

597
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:39,930
you can be owned and quite frankly

598
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:41,250
scared to crap at a 300 CIOs and some

599
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:44,100
people from the industry that were in

600
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:45,390
that presentation and one of the women

601
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:48,120
that sought our presentation was

602
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:51,690
actually visibly shaken she's also a

603
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:53,790
friend of mine so I looked at the

604
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:57,590
effects of that I realized that is not

605
00:26:53,790 --> 00:27:00,570
the way to train people that was a major

606
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:06,209
backfire on what they did hiring that

607
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:10,169
person so truth is what we do is we ask

608
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:12,270
users actually come up ask them does

609
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:16,170
this work doesn't it work how could it

610
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:17,430
work better and have put ideas for it

611
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:20,550
that actually means something to people

612
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:22,590
and that really means home usage and

613
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:24,149
it's not because I want to increase my

614
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:26,669
organization's liability it's because

615
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:28,590
the fact is people are gonna actually

616
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:31,860
listen to you if you related to their

617
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:33,870
personal lives and that's the biggest

618
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:35,219
thing you can do you don't do it because

619
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:38,189
some company comes in with all these

620
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:41,160
certifications and says oh you should do

621
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:45,450
it because we do XYZ if that doesn't

622
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:49,770
help you you gotta cover the actual

623
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:51,390
scenarios and quite frankly I want real

624
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:53,820
security people looking at the training

625
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:56,670
that we put out so that we can put out

626
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:58,620
something that's actually credible and I

627
00:27:56,670 --> 00:28:01,070
care about that immensely because again

628
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:05,040
ultimately whereas only as credible is

629
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:08,010
what we did in the past week I actually

630
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,730
write the training and a big part of

631
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:10,590
what I

632
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:12,390
part of why I read the trainings cuz I

633
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:15,540
hate most the other training because it

634
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:18,660
doesn't work for my customers and I

635
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:20,820
would rather go into the c-suite and say

636
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:22,679
I did this and work with all these

637
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:26,220
people and here's what we came up with

638
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:28,140
rather than hey I bought something you

639
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:34,230
not one do you not want to run me out of

640
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:36,330
town on a rail guess which one I pick so

641
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:38,220
we're getting getting over to having a

642
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:40,710
risk management plan because yes you

643
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:42,870
have to have one yes you have to put

644
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:44,640
together to rescue discovered real

645
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:48,360
date's behind them and then follow up on

646
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:50,820
them so why do they suck why do they

647
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:53,969
fail mmm the reason why is because many

648
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:56,399
of them are based in reality and the

649
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:58,610
other part is is that people put the

650
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:03,690
dates for the projects on they're not

651
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:05,280
actual completion tests what that means

652
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:08,280
is that yeah we finished this project

653
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:10,350
does that mean the plans done well no

654
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:12,389
I've actually had that conversation with

655
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:17,010
our friends at OCR you have to be able

656
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:19,110
to prove it works and yet the other have

657
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:22,169
test for successful completion and be

658
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:24,449
very clear retinal ulnar ability scanner

659
00:29:22,169 --> 00:29:26,070
is not a test for poor app security and

660
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:29,340
neither is slapping a web application

661
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:33,059
firewall on your crap code from 30 years

662
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:34,620
ago and calling it completes so thing to

663
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:36,210
keep in mind is that many members of

664
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:38,850
upper management like to buy things to

665
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:40,890
look good even when they don't work they

666
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:43,860
also love to be scoped and minimize

667
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:45,870
everything so a lot of the behaviors

668
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:48,090
that we've seen quite frankly in the

669
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:49,799
past couple of weeks with some people's

670
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:54,449
responses to the current social

671
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:59,040
situation are sadly very predictable

672
00:29:54,450 --> 00:30:01,230
given how upper management acts because

673
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:03,240
the person that's gonna discuss and

674
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:06,150
minimize security issues in the office

675
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:09,690
is going to do the same for anyone

676
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:13,140
that's not like them I'm really really

677
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:15,900
sad to say that so this is where we need

678
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:18,480
you anything we put in these a test or

679
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:20,520
test for success especially for

680
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,070
vulnerability management at NAB security

681
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:24,560
and especially

682
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:26,419
people trying to use technology to cover

683
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:29,270
up the gaping wounds that our API

684
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:32,330
security and I gotta love my friend to

685
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:35,780
listen valentina night for demonstrating

686
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:39,260
how much people need to do in that

687
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:43,610
regard and few weeks ago we pointed her

688
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:45,670
towards health care I do not want to be

689
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:47,959
any of those companies when she's done

690
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:54,020
because she's gonna own the crap out of

691
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:55,790
them and yes you do have to follow the

692
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:57,800
vendors because there are more than

693
00:30:55,790 --> 00:31:00,830
people that just try and sell you these

694
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:03,139
tools and gadgets they also provide

695
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:04,760
services to you and your responsibility

696
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:08,660
is to make sure they're secure for a

697
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:10,730
business tax state they perform so what

698
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:13,160
does that mean as I talked about before

699
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:15,350
you set up agreements to check them for

700
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:17,000
vulnerabilities I'll tell you the

701
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:18,230
biggest piece of software I brought in

702
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,650
during my tenure of my current

703
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:23,900
employment we've been testing them we

704
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:26,120
talked with them about security with the

705
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:28,910
team around and make sure they designed

706
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:30,830
security in because here's the other

707
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:33,170
deal even the major companies out there

708
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:36,439
they all have pretty good product

709
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:38,090
security teams these days it's not like

710
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,890
before where a lot of them hid from it

711
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:43,459
they will make products security people

712
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:46,040
available if you ask because they know

713
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:47,810
it's a game changer and quite frankly a

714
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:50,690
lot of the larger men device companies

715
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:51,980
know that they will lose business if

716
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:55,220
they don't produce the cyber security

717
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:56,930
people so have that conversation start

718
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:58,400
having the conversations even if it's a

719
00:31:56,930 --> 00:32:00,290
little conversation have a conversation

720
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:02,810
and I'm gonna put something here at

721
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:05,680
invite in this presentation if they give

722
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:10,790
you an answer as a paragraph ignore them

723
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:12,410
if if their answer is anything but we

724
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:16,379
will get you someone from our team to

725
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:17,760
talk to and that purse

726
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:20,130
sufficient level to actually do

727
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:24,690
something that's the answer you need any

728
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:27,420
day of the week be persistent but even

729
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:28,800
if you don't find them via your

730
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:32,400
management chain because quite frankly

731
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:35,280
some of us deal with how I put it bad

732
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:36,870
managers find them on your own because

733
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:39,000
most of them are on LinkedIn most of

734
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:40,889
them aren't I Triple E working groups

735
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,230
most of them earn I so working groups

736
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:45,230
you can find them in 30 minutes so

737
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:50,550
moving on we're gonna talk about another

738
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:53,159
topic here which is data loss prevention

739
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:57,149
or cloud access security broker deal

740
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:58,590
p.m. Cosby so this is realistically what

741
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:59,880
it is that's when you take a look at

742
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:03,120
outbound traffic and look for your

743
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:05,940
company's data heading outs however very

744
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,439
ineffective with ransomware why because

745
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:09,300
the ransomware operators know they

746
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,700
encrypted themselves using a different

747
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:14,270
algorithm and don't have access to the

748
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:17,760
keys that can decrypt it and transport

749
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:20,910
it's not that it's not going to be

750
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:24,000
effective you'll be just gonna go hey I

751
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:27,120
see something encrypted but problem is

752
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,460
key loss 1.3 has the same issue however

753
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:31,530
it's something that the business uses to

754
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:33,080
find the less sophisticated attackers

755
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:36,240
and aren't trying to ransom your data

756
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:38,370
but most importantly it finds the people

757
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,200
that are trying to bypass forum or

758
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:43,729
bypassed more super established

759
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:46,020
processes it's passive but again

760
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:47,700
realistically it does serve a purpose

761
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:51,030
although it's not really French

762
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:54,930
filtration of data it's to basically

763
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:57,120
find bad business processes because

764
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:59,100
there's always ways to exfiltrate data I

765
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:01,080
think our friends who have attacked tons

766
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:07,290
of places with ransomware have proven

767
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:10,549
that so brings me to PCI DSS and I'm

768
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:14,370
going to break some sacred cows here

769
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:16,169
first of all PCI DSS voluntary standards

770
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:18,290
that merchant banks insurance companies

771
00:34:16,168 --> 00:34:20,850
require so you can process payments

772
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:24,389
because you can volunteer it's not

773
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:26,159
regulatory you can not comply but good

774
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:28,929
luck processing credit cards when no one

775
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:31,480
carries cash there's a lot

776
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:34,800
some processes but little focus on how

777
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:37,809
to actually prove requirements 6 and 11

778
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:40,030
usually people put charge earnest and

779
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:43,619
Finance people their accountants you

780
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:46,300
understand controls they're not us and

781
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:48,159
what we need is people looking at

782
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:51,280
hammering on these systems who don't

783
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,960
make the assumptions about controls he's

784
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,720
not everyone runs these systems are

785
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,609
accountants so we need people hammer in

786
00:34:55,719 --> 00:35:00,520
the cracks of our credit card processing

787
00:34:57,609 --> 00:35:04,630
systems because there's too many people

788
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:08,230
that have PCI AOC who we can break into

789
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:10,329
we know this and several of the really

790
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:13,230
good qsa is out there qualified service

791
00:35:10,329 --> 00:35:16,000
Assessors also realize that however

792
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:22,180
there's a lot that don'ts and we'll

793
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:23,670
leave it at that so brings me to

794
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:25,690
something else

795
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:27,400
because it's one of the big things the

796
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:30,790
big bridge between this is a lot of

797
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:34,150
people process data crank our data now

798
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:35,770
on smartphones so smartphones in the

799
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:39,609
cloud a lot of organizations still don't

800
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:41,380
get it they don't realize that you no

801
00:35:39,609 --> 00:35:43,980
longer have a perimeter and that you

802
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:48,040
have to use good secure programming and

803
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:50,380
the firewall is gone what I've been

804
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:52,990
seeing that makes me think some people

805
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:54,490
are really smoking something is a lot of

806
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:56,410
people these days are telling you they

807
00:35:54,490 --> 00:36:02,740
can put the firewall or VPN in the cloud

808
00:35:56,410 --> 00:36:03,450
on 5g I wish I was making this up but

809
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:06,270
the thing is

810
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:09,598
that's the most is that's for all these

811
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:11,369
apps are gonna be used with smartphones

812
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:14,010
in the cloud is that the 21st century

813
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:15,329
cures act final rule which was signed in

814
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:17,430
the lawn March

815
00:36:15,329 --> 00:36:19,680
doesn't mandate protection for apps or

816
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:21,598
api's storing of transmitting patient

817
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:26,220
data on behalf of the patient so

818
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:28,980
basically I have this situation here

819
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:31,020
where I have this smartphone apps out

820
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:33,390
there that aren't required to have

821
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:37,640
secured protections storing patient data

822
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:40,859
and storing all sorts of data and

823
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:44,940
there's no and you really have to depend

824
00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:48,410
upon the way the application is coded

825
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:48,410
and written to be able to be effective

826
00:36:48,680 --> 00:37:00,180
so I believe this meme is appropriate

827
00:36:53,660 --> 00:37:02,700
and it's true sadly so how can you help

828
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:06,328
if you see an issue with this document

829
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:08,160
it let us know start focusing on the APS

830
00:37:06,329 --> 00:37:11,609
and patient facing applications because

831
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:13,109
we don't know we can't help you we need

832
00:37:11,609 --> 00:37:14,940
to put a lot of pressure on people

833
00:37:13,109 --> 00:37:17,460
developing the apps to make sure they're

834
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:19,950
also secure because the thing that keeps

835
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:22,890
us up at night is that the

836
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:24,359
implementation of these API is and the

837
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:26,790
implementation of these services is

838
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:29,520
gonna cost organic data breaches hell

839
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:31,950
we've already seen AWS buckets get get

840
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:35,730
pilfered because somebody left private

841
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:39,629
keys in app code not as bad as a Capital

842
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:41,700
One one but again we've seen fitness

843
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:45,240
apps for people hard-coded the public

844
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:46,399
key into an iPhone app and now that

845
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,328
there's actually gonna be a standard API

846
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,549
that people have to follow

847
00:37:48,329 --> 00:37:51,799
exfiltration becomes very easy because

848
00:37:50,549 --> 00:37:55,079
everyone's gonna be using the same API

849
00:37:51,799 --> 00:37:58,440
implementations and the 21st century

850
00:37:55,079 --> 00:38:01,280
cures Act final rule calls for fire 401

851
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:03,750
fast health interoperability resources

852
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:08,010
you can download the example code off

853
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:09,900
and get out so we have to know from you

854
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:11,910
what the hell's going on and if

855
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:13,440
something is insecure somebody's doing

856
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:16,589
something hasn't done the correct

857
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,220
testing we're talking about using a

858
00:38:16,589 --> 00:38:19,400
Piazza

859
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:21,810
contested we have to know immediately

860
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:28,440
cuz we can't help you if we don't know

861
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:30,359
it exists so it was over now we talked

862
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:32,430
about that issue let's talk about

863
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:34,078
privacy so security talks about

864
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:37,140
restricting access to what you should

865
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:38,880
have primacy is about enforcing

866
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:41,129
someone's right to keep her info secret

867
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:44,520
or as I like to say just because you can

868
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:46,319
does not mean you should so how do we

869
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:50,730
guard against people doing that even

870
00:38:46,319 --> 00:38:53,730
when they have access so we care about

871
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:56,130
the ability of people to can force who

872
00:38:53,730 --> 00:39:00,560
can look at their records and why why

873
00:38:56,130 --> 00:39:02,609
it's actually federal law under HIPAA

874
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,680
patients can request an accounting the

875
00:39:02,609 --> 00:39:08,670
disclosures in other words who looked at

876
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:10,560
their records and why financed they bury

877
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:12,210
it in audit language that's about three

878
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:15,740
inches thick but same thing basically

879
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:21,300
applies also professional conduct

880
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:23,220
so HIPAA you can go to jail and you can

881
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:25,619
and you might lose a professional

882
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:27,660
license finance they can't you pulling

883
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:29,250
this stuff off as an accountant you're

884
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:33,690
not gonna be an accountant much longer I

885
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:35,130
think money anymore and under Samsung

886
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:39,000
mental health and substance abuse Act

887
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:40,440
they basically augment habits and make

888
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,140
the penalties even worse and there's

889
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:44,760
also state laws so we need an

890
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:47,040
administrative structure to enforce this

891
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:50,069
because this is ethics more than in this

892
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:51,779
technology and some people try and make

893
00:39:50,069 --> 00:39:57,329
a technology to make themselves look

894
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:59,430
good so what happens people treat it as

895
00:39:57,329 --> 00:40:02,069
a security problem they limit access

896
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:04,589
where they should this affects patient

897
00:40:02,069 --> 00:40:06,869
care because we restrict access from

898
00:40:04,589 --> 00:40:09,349
systems and when people actually need to

899
00:40:06,869 --> 00:40:11,760
date it they can't get access to it and

900
00:40:09,349 --> 00:40:14,880
the truth is is that few providers

901
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,800
logger on it this access if you review

902
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,420
for potential breaches there was a

903
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,829
Health System area in the end I got sued

904
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:23,540
by the state attorney general for not

905
00:40:19,829 --> 00:40:25,950
doing this and many find out when

906
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:28,800
identity theft happens or when it gets

907
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:30,868
so egregious they get caught usually the

908
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,520
only time you see this in the paper is

909
00:40:30,869 --> 00:40:34,800
when they fire someone for looking at so

910
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:38,040
many medical records that if bypass is

911
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:41,819
almost every control so what can we do

912
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:43,920
about that we can start planning the

913
00:40:41,819 --> 00:40:49,190
scene for a preventive privacy

914
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:52,260
monitoring and surprisingly here this is

915
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:56,640
when security conferences me convincing

916
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:58,200
people that's more security in certain

917
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:01,078
places as a hindrance and leads to

918
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:03,390
workarounds are less secure I have

919
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:06,089
actually gotten from the c-suite and

920
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:08,069
said this and talked about how the

921
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:11,250
workarounds are less secure and lead to

922
00:41:08,069 --> 00:41:14,400
additional patient risk they cause more

923
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:16,530
issues than they solve so instead of

924
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,569
actually trying to be detectives and

925
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:20,280
monitoring controls and making sure

926
00:41:18,569 --> 00:41:24,089
people are doing the right thing the

927
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:26,240
right way and also according to policy

928
00:41:24,089 --> 00:41:29,549
which says they should and federal law

929
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:32,310
people trying to cut things around never

930
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:34,710
a good thing so we had to have the

931
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:37,470
preventative monitoring in place and not

932
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:41,430
be like last see us not be like that CFO

933
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:44,730
I talked to so this brings us to our

934
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:47,598
friends in human resources so why are

935
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:49,700
they called human resources first answer

936
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:52,020
because applied industrial

937
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:56,040
organizational psychology is a lot of

938
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:57,839
words to say for somebody so there's

939
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,640
also a misunderstanding here they're not

940
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:01,650
the department asking for six years

941
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,700
experience on Windows 10 or 10 years on

942
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:05,190
office 365

943
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:07,169
that's recruitment and if a company's

944
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:09,690
asking for that kind of stuff more than

945
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:13,040
likely they are looking to outsource to

946
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:15,300
position anyway and they're making their

947
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,910
requirements impossible just so they

948
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:20,010
could say hey yeah we posted a job but

949
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:22,788
no one met the qualification so we have

950
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:24,469
to outsource to this firm

951
00:42:22,789 --> 00:42:26,089
and they're actually the ones

952
00:42:24,469 --> 00:42:28,819
responsible for addressing workforce

953
00:42:26,089 --> 00:42:31,459
issues such as computer misuse privacy

954
00:42:28,819 --> 00:42:34,369
and snooping or stocking issues and as

955
00:42:31,459 --> 00:42:36,618
I've learned when somebody suits from

956
00:42:34,369 --> 00:42:39,130
lawful termination they're the ones that

957
00:42:36,619 --> 00:42:41,660
coordinate when you appear in court and

958
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:44,119
they're completely misunderstood by tech

959
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:47,419
teams for what they do I've worked with

960
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:49,459
one really really really good one and a

961
00:42:47,419 --> 00:42:53,209
lot who could learn from them how to do

962
00:42:49,459 --> 00:42:56,299
their jobs so very happy to work with

963
00:42:53,209 --> 00:42:58,219
who I work with and there are some that

964
00:42:56,299 --> 00:43:00,279
really do understand technology well and

965
00:42:58,219 --> 00:43:04,039
may have certain interim CIO position

966
00:43:00,279 --> 00:43:06,799
these are very rare actually no -

967
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:09,799
believe it or not and one was a

968
00:43:06,799 --> 00:43:11,449
professor of mine in college and many

969
00:43:09,799 --> 00:43:13,219
don't understand a computer security

970
00:43:11,449 --> 00:43:15,709
even need so you have to sit down and

971
00:43:13,219 --> 00:43:18,109
have that conversation with them and you

972
00:43:15,709 --> 00:43:20,118
really want to do this before the FBI or

973
00:43:18,109 --> 00:43:22,880
other law enforcement shows up and gives

974
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:25,249
them a crash course as to what computer

975
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,109
misuse means this was something to have

976
00:43:25,249 --> 00:43:29,718
in the media building in my career when

977
00:43:27,109 --> 00:43:31,630
we had a case of administrative misuse

978
00:43:29,719 --> 00:43:35,059
we had an assistant administrator a

979
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:37,069
contract that was on decided he was

980
00:43:35,059 --> 00:43:38,659
gonna read everyone's email one day or

981
00:43:37,069 --> 00:43:40,719
actually he did it over the course of a

982
00:43:38,659 --> 00:43:43,999
year and a half and he discovered it and

983
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:46,279
Human Resources had to get in crash

984
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:48,140
course on unlawful access to stored

985
00:43:46,279 --> 00:43:50,630
communication only it wasn't InfoSec

986
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:52,578
getting it it was a very nice man with a

987
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:55,519
badge and a gun sitting him down telling

988
00:43:52,579 --> 00:43:59,569
them this person committed a felony and

989
00:43:55,519 --> 00:44:01,428
this is what we have to do now and the

990
00:43:59,569 --> 00:44:04,489
other reason you want to have that

991
00:44:01,429 --> 00:44:06,259
conversation with HR is very clear

992
00:44:04,489 --> 00:44:09,890
remember I talked about management being

993
00:44:06,259 --> 00:44:12,049
self-centered we have a lot of managers

994
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:14,569
that abuse the system and power trip and

995
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:17,739
one of the biggest challenges I've had

996
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:21,669
in my career has been stopping

997
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:26,259
managerial overreach and putting

998
00:44:21,669 --> 00:44:30,379
controls in place to stop management

999
00:44:26,259 --> 00:44:33,109
from abusing the system and we're

1000
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:35,089
talking about cases where people were

1001
00:44:33,109 --> 00:44:36,500
trying to get information without

1002
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:39,529
following due process

1003
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:42,320
Tremayne employees I have had numerous

1004
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:46,640
cases where people were trying to

1005
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:51,290
override due process for basically

1006
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:53,509
depriving employment and I've had to

1007
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:54,830
work this has not happened at eye health

1008
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:57,680
by the way this happened in other places

1009
00:44:54,830 --> 00:45:01,310
I had to put those controls in place

1010
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:02,600
because quite frankly one organisation

1011
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:06,170
when this happens to organisations

1012
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:08,120
terminate employees sue they settle and

1013
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:09,820
that manager thinking you're getting

1014
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:11,509
away with something ends up being a

1015
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:14,210
six-figure fine

1016
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:21,110
all legal costs and all previous salary

1017
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:23,780
and and their old job back so you have

1018
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:27,380
to be very clear and good about how you

1019
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:29,300
do things and you want to make sure HR

1020
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:31,460
understands that because there will be

1021
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:35,150
people to try and abuse the system and

1022
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:37,040
we have to work to stop them and they do

1023
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:38,380
work with trusted business partners to a

1024
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:41,900
system with addressing these issues

1025
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:43,850
including overreach the other thing we

1026
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:47,090
do that I like to do is separate out a

1027
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:49,299
lot of functions to make sure that there

1028
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:51,680
is never an appearance of impropriety

1029
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:55,100
whatsoever on the part of anybody

1030
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:57,799
because again ultimately you have to be

1031
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:59,330
above reproach in this position and we

1032
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:02,840
can't be in a position where somebody

1033
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:06,920
can abuse the system to adverse acne to

1034
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:09,730
adverse consequences so why does the HR

1035
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:11,350
have to know our policies

1036
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:14,830
to this because when people get fired

1037
00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:15,970
over them they'll sue and your policies

1038
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:18,670
at the mash-up with the rest of the

1039
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:19,569
organizations so under HIPAA we're

1040
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:21,580
required to have what's called a

1041
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:24,370
sanctions policy that calls for

1042
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:26,380
terminations for bad conduct aka someone

1043
00:46:24,370 --> 00:46:28,600
going in looking at your medical record

1044
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:31,090
and selling it to a tabloid for $10,000

1045
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:32,710
I wish I was making it up but that was

1046
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:34,900
the example I've actually given in the

1047
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:37,510
past to HR executives I was talking

1048
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:39,460
about kim kardashian because everyone

1049
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:42,160
knows who she is more importantly

1050
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:44,230
everyone those a number of people got

1051
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:46,060
fired from cedars-sinai in LA for

1052
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:48,760
looking at her medical records and those

1053
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:53,830
of her children everyone knows that case

1054
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:57,460
happened but ultimately your policies

1055
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:59,319
have to sync up with EHRs and you have

1056
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:02,770
to be able to provably an affirmative ly

1057
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:04,950
show so another case an example where

1058
00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:09,210
talking about training and why it sucks

1059
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:11,319
because if your training sucks and

1060
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:13,450
somebody claims to have signed off on

1061
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:16,960
the training and your training does not

1062
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:18,730
pass muster with the courts when you're

1063
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,830
being when your organization is being

1064
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:22,990
sued

1065
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:24,970
guess who loses a lawsuit and guess who

1066
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:27,850
might not be employed very much same

1067
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:31,419
time soon so you have to be very careful

1068
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:34,360
about this and you have to know their

1069
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:37,390
policies as well and when anything

1070
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:40,680
happens you know you do not have free

1071
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:45,250
will I'll be very very clear about this

1072
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:46,569
because if you get sued and you go and

1073
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:50,080
it goes to the labor board in certain

1074
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:52,840
states you might be able to see your

1075
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:56,740
responses to the administrative law

1076
00:47:52,840 --> 00:48:00,010
judge and Google and if the answer to

1077
00:47:56,740 --> 00:48:01,509
every question is any question is I did

1078
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:04,630
this on my own without can without

1079
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:07,830
talking to an HR layer guess who loses

1080
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:07,830
the case and guess who might

1081
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:13,220
because what's gonna have

1082
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:16,430
is there gonna employers gonna lose a

1083
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:18,529
lot of money and guess how they're gonna

1084
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:22,460
pay for some of that offset some of that

1085
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:23,140
lost your salary so I'm sorry to put it

1086
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:26,240
that way

1087
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:28,790
HR despite some of the misgivings that

1088
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:31,459
some people have about them you have to

1089
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:33,290
be best friends with them there's no

1090
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:34,610
other way I will tell you I have a good

1091
00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:41,270
relationship with Human Resources

1092
00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:42,980
because I understand this so now I'm

1093
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:45,710
gonna stop scaring you about that let's

1094
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:47,780
talk about ransomware so the way we use

1095
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:49,550
ransomware to talk to people is about

1096
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:54,230
the culmination of multiple minor

1097
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:56,360
security threats it's the perfect storm

1098
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:58,190
a lot of minor incidents that coalesce

1099
00:48:56,360 --> 00:49:01,220
to become tech secessionists instead

1100
00:48:58,190 --> 00:49:03,410
threatens companies aka all the things

1101
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:05,240
you overlooked and everything you didn't

1102
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:07,190
do everything you said you'd put off

1103
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:10,549
till next week or next quarter or next

1104
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:13,520
year or I need to have this open for so

1105
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:15,950
and so that's what it all comes together

1106
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:17,120
by some very smart people usually based

1107
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:19,460
out of countries that we don't have

1108
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:22,130
extradition treaties with and gets

1109
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:25,130
combines where's I'd like to put it they

1110
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:28,460
slap - oh no you did sign over security

1111
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:31,100
and it makes a lot of companies realize

1112
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:34,400
that they weren't doing what they were

1113
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:38,779
supposed to and a lot of them still out

1114
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:39,440
for a quick fix because put here this

1115
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:42,920
way

1116
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:47,120
I gave a presentation in 2016 at Issa

1117
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:49,040
political and I went up against two

1118
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:50,750
security companies I went first talking

1119
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:52,460
about how to stop ransomware and two

1120
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:57,800
companies were more than willing to sell

1121
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:59,720
solutions immediately afterward so it's

1122
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:01,310
up to us we've all got to sit down with

1123
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:04,399
the management and explain how this

1124
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:06,279
works and how cutting corners leads to

1125
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:11,930
that perfect storm and needs to

1126
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:14,240
potentially existential events so how do

1127
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:16,220
we evolve from here you get to know us

1128
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,000
we really want to hear from you I

1129
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:19,430
promise

1130
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,900
most of my peers and I suppose I speak

1131
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:22,609
to most of my peers being industry and

1132
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:24,230
bill finance and healthcare I also speak

1133
00:50:22,610 --> 00:50:26,540
to people in higher ed we're not

1134
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:29,630
clueless if we don't know what the

1135
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:30,710
hell's going on we can't help you make

1136
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:33,560

pocs are always welcome and in my case I

1140
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:45,799

00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:52,610
going on we can't help you and we're

1144
