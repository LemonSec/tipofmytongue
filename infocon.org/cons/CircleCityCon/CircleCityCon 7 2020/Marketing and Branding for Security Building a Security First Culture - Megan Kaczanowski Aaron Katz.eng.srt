00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:11,300
hi everyone my name is Megan kuznetsky

2
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:14,390
and I work as a threat intelligence

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:16,070
analyst at S&P global and my name is

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:18,710
Erin Katz and I'm the director of cyber

5
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:20,240
defense at SMP global Wow Erin that

6
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:23,300
sounds like a hell of a lot of buzzwords

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,189
what a cyber defense mean great question

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,259
in addition to managing buzzwords at the

9
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:28,999
company I'm also responsible for heading

10
00:00:27,259 --> 00:00:31,399
the vulnerability management threat

11
00:00:28,999 --> 00:00:33,320
intelligence Incident Response Security

12
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:34,990
Operations Center and security

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,070
automation and orchestration functions

14
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:39,710
well that's a lot but none of that

15
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:41,600
sounds like security awareness why are

16
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:43,910
you giving this talk it's another

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,190
excellent question really really

18
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:48,019
insightful and glad you asked the

19
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:49,489
important part here that we are not part

20
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,050
of security awareness because we are

21
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:53,270
part of marketing and branding for

22
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:56,480
information security building a culture

23
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:58,910
that involves every single individual

24
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,669
not just your awareness team your

25
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:04,339
awareness team our fantastic partners to

26
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:06,770
set the stage to set your program set

27
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:08,600
the foundations but if you want to

28
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,030
establish a culture it's important that

29
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,820
every single person from information

30
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:15,830
security can champion that culture of

31
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,440
security that can help educate that can

32
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:20,780
help inform it's important especially

33
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,880
now when you see that developers

34
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:25,220
business analysts vendor risk teams

35
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,500
everyone needs to know about security at

36
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:29,330
this point investors are not really

37
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,430
gonna open their wallets anymore without

38
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:34,009
asking how you're securing the data how

39
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:36,470
you're securing their data the customers

40
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,970
data so it's important to partner with

41
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:40,310
your awareness team but make sure that

42
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,960
every single person that's a subject

43
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:46,210
matter expert is able to deliver a

44
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:49,479
training and to enforce and educate

45
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:52,339
security training throughout the company

46
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:53,780
listening we are because we have a

47
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,549
little more flexibility so we're looking

48
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,500
at the discord if you have any questions

49
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:59,240
please feel free to toss those in there

50
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,070
we'd love for this to be more of a

51
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,420
conversation so if you have questions as

52
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,820
you have them you know toss them in

53
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:06,439
there we'll do our best to respond

54
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:07,880
during the presentation but then we'll

55
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:10,068
also respond to questions at the end if

56
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,650
there are any or you can always message

57
00:02:10,068 --> 00:02:14,160
F some discord as well and so the idea

58
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,690
for this talk this market

59
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,760
branding for an Cossack building a

60
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:20,760
security first culture came out of

61
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:24,420
things that basically we were missing

62
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:26,790
about four years ago SP security team

63
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:30,179
was seven people in the last four years

64
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:31,769
it's moved up to 45 people so in the

65
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,020
last four years we've grown from not

66
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,820
having a particularly big security team

67
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,320
to quite a large one while the size of

68
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,970
the company hasn't really shifted it's

69
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,609
been about twenty five thousand people

70
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:43,680
the entire time and while 45 might seem

71
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,600
like a lot again we're still looking at

72
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,970
protecting roughly twenty five twenty

73
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,920
six thousand employees the other thing

74
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:51,720
that happened in during this shift was

75
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,000
we moved from a very distributed

76
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,670
operation absent he used to be a series

77
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,410
of divisions all of which handled

78
00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:00,089
security and IT operations by themselves

79
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:02,730
and over the last four years that

80
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:06,120
centralized into one tip with security

81
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:07,619
team and those two shifts drove a huge

82
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,150
change in security because when you only

83
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,200
have seven people for a company of

84
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:15,240
25,000 and you're only handling some

85
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:17,100
general questions often people don't

86
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,330
particularly care about security or they

87
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,680
don't even realize that there is a

88
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:21,390
security team they don't know who to

89
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,360
contact when to contact them or how to

90
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:26,279
contact them and so as we grew and as we

91
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,830
had more resources we realized very

92
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,410
quickly that we needed to expand that as

93
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:33,900
well a lot of people have a negative

94
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:35,490
opinion of security teams we're seen as

95
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,080
more tact the preventer of information

96
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:39,450
security services of anyone seen the

97
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:42,360
Dilbert cartoon and we realized that if

98
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:44,730
we wanted to change that opinion we'd

99
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,989
need to do so from the ground up it

100
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,450
would be really important for us to

101
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:50,220
build buy-in not only from your average

102
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:52,589
end users but from your developers and

103
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:54,840
particularly from your executives often

104
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,580
I think building buy-in sounds like kind

105
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,010
of these buzzwords that we throw out

106
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:01,320
there without any real context but the

107
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:03,120
key here is that getting by and getting

108
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,070
executives on your side means more money

109
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,390
it means more resources you know

110
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:08,400
technical and controls aren't enough

111
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:10,380
because the least technical person in

112
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,000
your company I guarantee can find a way

113
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,890
around your proxies if they really want

114
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,130
to watch porn like we've all thought on

115
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:18,659
that we've all seen it happen and

116
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:20,430
because of that the technical controls

117
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,140
are in a knife you need polish that we

118
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:23,580
rely a lot on policies and procedures

119
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,180
people following those policies and

120
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,370
procedure

121
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,919
and consequences if they don't just

122
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:31,080
secure our systems and so getting that

123
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:32,190
to happen requires the people who are

124
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,800
actually supposed to follow the

125
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:36,900
procedures to understand you know what

126
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,440
that means and why they should follow

127
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:42,030
them before we get there if you want to

128
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,530
find out what's wrong in your company

129
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:47,070
about a lot of the vulnerabilities in

130
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:48,780
your company talk to your users you're

131
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,740
gonna get some great insight if you ask

132
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,960
an analyst

133
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,310
how are you browsing the Internet how

134
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,109
are you getting around these controls

135
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:57,180
they're gonna find a lot of these

136
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:58,500
bypasses because they feel that they're

137
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,030
being stifled that they're not able to

138
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,970
do their job and they have to find these

139
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:05,008
workarounds and the problem is at the

140
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:06,660
beginning you have that kind of

141
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:08,639
adversarial relationship if they're and

142
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:11,849
if they never talk to security except

143
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,080
when something's bad there's no real

144
00:05:11,849 --> 00:05:16,050
incentive for them to raise those issues

145
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,698
and the idea for this talk of marketing

146
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,800
and branding building a security culture

147
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:21,990
is that we want them to come forward and

148
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,820
identify that this is potentially a

149
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:26,729
risky practice and how do we work with

150
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:28,349
security to be more secure while also

151
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:33,539
ensuring that the business can get the

152
00:05:28,349 --> 00:05:35,729
job done and this is I think is really

153
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:37,860
important every security team that I've

154
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:40,440
talked to at some point or another asks

155
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,970
that question why don't you tzer's care

156
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,570
about security if it wasn't for our

157
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:47,310
users we're gonna be extremely secure so

158
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:48,270
in our own company our phishing rates

159
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:50,940
pretty much sucked

160
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:53,609
there was no prioritization or concern

161
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:55,259
over vulnerability remediation how many

162
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:57,030
times do you see a news article where

163
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:58,680
they talk about this years old

164
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:01,289
vulnerability was exploited and that's

165
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,330
why they got hacked I have not really

166
00:06:01,289 --> 00:06:05,250
met a team that really has every single

167
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:07,909
one of those patched but we had a real

168
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:09,990
bad lack of prioritization and concern

169
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:13,409
we also had a very poor understanding

170
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:15,630
just basic cyber hygiene as an example

171
00:06:13,409 --> 00:06:19,800
only 30 percent of Americans actually

172
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:22,289
know what HTTPS means only 24 percent of

173
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,759
them know what private browsing is so

174
00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:25,469
when we see a lot of people trying to

175
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,729
watch porn in the office we see that

176
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:29,039
they're trying to watch it on a price on

177
00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:31,590
private browsing not realizing that

178
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:34,380
we're still able to see it so why do we

179
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:36,419
have a lot of these cases the biggest

180
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,600
issue that I've seen is that we have a

181
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:40,599
big over esta

182
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,030
nation of user knowledge we think users

183
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,770
understand more about security and the

184
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:47,349
reasons behind it than they actually do

185
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:49,090
and part of that is that we overestimate

186
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:51,100
how much our training has actually sunk

187
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:53,650
in if you're only doing an annual

188
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:55,240
training or if it's somewhat sporadic it

189
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:57,310
goes in one ear out the other

190
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,830
they click through take the quiz and

191
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:03,010
move on with their work they're not

192
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:04,419
really absorbing those lessons and the

193
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:06,880
worst problem is that a lot of times

194
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:09,550
they won't understand the context of why

195
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:12,190
security does what they do at a previous

196
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:13,720
company when I first joined and I said

197
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:16,300
there's a ton of vulnerabilities on the

198
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,980
system how do we fix it I was told oh

199
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,720
they don't let you patch it because it's

200
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,160
super critical to business five million

201
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:24,040
dollars in revenue they're not touching

202
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,540
it all it took was me given the phone

203
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,580
call to the business representative

204
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:29,230
explaining the risk and all he asked was

205
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:31,740
that makes sense can you please patch it

206
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:33,910
on Saturday so it's less impactful

207
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,320
explaining the context and taking that

208
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:36,970
time so they understand why it's

209
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,580
important and how it helps the business

210
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:41,860
is critical rather than just getting a

211
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:45,880
directive from the security inbox or

212
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:47,260
taking a training once a year we talked

213
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,210
a little bit about the problem we've got

214
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:51,070
basically an overestimation of what

215
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:53,049
users know by the security team we've

216
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:55,000
talked about the fact that we're

217
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:57,460
overwhelmed and that we're trying to you

218
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,020
know it's secured a large amount of

219
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:01,060
space and you have limited resources

220
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,560
which is other people money whatever

221
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,330
everyone's going to run into some kind

222
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,890
of resource constraint so our solution

223
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:08,620
was branding and marketing it's almost

224
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:10,000
like magic and a couple things here one

225
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:12,340
of which is that we are lucky enough to

226
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,040
have a security awareness team and if

227
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:16,510
you are that's awesome however when I

228
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,890
say team I mean one person and that

229
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:19,480
person is also responsible for

230
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:21,130
ediscovery which means they're quite

231
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,840
busy and after they run monthly phishing

232
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:24,550
campaigns and they put out an annual

233
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:27,159
training they basically are out of

234
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:28,840
bandwidth to help us and so we've the

235
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,820
other thing is that that's what of why

236
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,819
we first got involved in security

237
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:35,140
awareness and training changing culture

238
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,789
the thing that helped and the thing that

239
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,130
continued to keep us invalids that we

240
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:41,439
found that when we had the sort of topic

241
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:44,290
experts or subject experts as people on

242
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,790
the stage giving presentations talking

243
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:48,069
about what we learned those things

244
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:49,599
helped a lot because it meant that if

245
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,710
someone asks a question you could give

246
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,330
them an immediate answer

247
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:54,760
rather than having to say I'll get back

248
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:56,170
to you later or check out this blog it

249
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,939
also allowed us to give a lot more

250
00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:00,670
tailored presentations so we could talk

251
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:03,850
directly to specific groups and specific

252
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:06,010
patterns and we found that that was

253
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:08,050
really important so that we were not

254
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:09,580
just you know the problem with an annual

255
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:11,380
training as we all know is that it's so

256
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:13,150
watered down is to be not that helpful

257
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,710
you know what asked questions like if a

258
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:16,329
strange man comes up to you and gives

259
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:18,550
you a USB Drive should you plug it into

260
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:20,230
your computer even in the under normal

261
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:22,209
circumstance of the Internet's probably

262
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:23,530
no and so those trainings aren't are

263
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:25,300
sort of that helpful at a general level

264
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:27,130
but they're not helpful and actually

265
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:29,260
changing the culture of an organization

266
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:30,640
and that comes from a number of stats so

267
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,960
in this presentation we're gonna take

268
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,189
you through a number of the things that

269
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:35,050
we've tried over the last couple of

270
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:36,880
years to change the culture from the

271
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:38,050
bottom up we'll talk a little bit about

272
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,540
whether or not we think these things

273
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:42,540
work virtually and hazard how we can

274
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:45,010
adapt them to be in sort of a more

275
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,780
adaptable remote working environment and

276
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:49,540
also how much effort that they're going

277
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:51,370
to take whether that's resources or

278
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:53,680
money or just time you have to spend on

279
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:55,450
it and because this wouldn't be a

280
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,829
security presentation without

281
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:58,600
referencing mitre attack we've

282
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:00,250
structured it like that and we'll start

283
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,740
with winning the hearts hearts and minds

284
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:04,480
of the people initial access how do you

285
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:06,190
get people to first pay attention to you

286
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,230
and the only experience that hydras

287
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:09,490
security is either someone screaming at

288
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,720
them in the middle of an incident saying

289
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:13,420
I need you to take your production

290
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,760
system offline right now or the annual

291
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:18,880
training so we started with

292
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,170
presentations and this to us we were

293
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,450
actually invited to give a presentation

294
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:24,370
a couple years ago to our CIO and his

295
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:26,380
leadership team because we just started

296
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:28,120
our threat intelligence team and he

297
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,710
didn't know what that was so we gave a

298
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,870
presentation we talked about what threat

299
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:33,610
threat intelligence was why it mattered

300
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:35,740
at the company and what we could do for

301
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:38,200
him and that turned out to be a really

302
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:39,850
illuminating conversation because we

303
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,470
hadn't eaten executives in the room who

304
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:43,540
were able to ask questions that maybe

305
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,890
they've been concerned to ask before you

306
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:47,020
know they asked us what is the dark web

307
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:49,870
are worried about the dark web how do

308
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:52,180
you get on the dark web and those type

309
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:54,520
of questions started getting us both a

310
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:56,709
more familiar with what our executives

311
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:59,079
knew and also gave us ideas for how we

312
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:00,670
could better structure it and in fact

313
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,260
the presentation went so well that we

314
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,880
were then able to give a number of

315
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,300
presentation

316
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,470
around 10:00 two different offices or

317
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:09,540
divisions and teams throughout the

318
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,860
company over the next year and we'll

319
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,599
talk a little bit about what made those

320
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,430
so successful but part of it was that

321
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,550
just and we were able to tailor those

322
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:19,380
presentations very much to that group

323
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:20,880
our second thing we did was direct

324
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,530
outreach to leadership so this took the

325
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,420
form of a lot of different things

326
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:26,310
basically whenever we needed support for

327
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,990
a project rather than sending a general

328
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:30,180
email we'd reach out directly to a lot

329
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:32,100
of the leadership teams so for example

330
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:34,709
our had of application security wanted

331
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,810
to get off the ground a program to teach

332
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:38,640
developers how to code more securely so

333
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:41,430
we reached out to all of the heads of

334
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,110
the development teams and had one-on-one

335
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:45,359
meetings with them got their bi and

336
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:46,890
convinced them to nominate developers

337
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,240
from their teams rather than asking

338
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:50,040
developers to self-select

339
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,740
and that was important for two reasons

340
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,120
one it got the developers both feeling

341
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,140
as though they'd want to prize rather

342
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,090
than they've been forced to take

343
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,860
additional training and it also showed

344
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:01,140
that there was top-down support for this

345
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:03,570
kind of initiative that this was a value

346
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:05,460
of the company and that people should

347
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:08,700
care about cybersecurity even if they

348
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:11,850
didn't and the last item that we want to

349
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:13,080
talk about was our town halls and most

350
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:14,790
companies have something like this

351
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:17,730
whether it's a town hall All Hands

352
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:19,949
meeting group meetings in this case we

353
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:23,790
were asked by the CEO who runs a town

354
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:25,680
hall every quarter so just explain

355
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:28,140
security and why it's important to the

356
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,300
company so this was hosted in person in

357
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:33,510
New York but virtually streamed to every

358
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:36,240
single one of our locations and in that

359
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:38,700
discussion I went through why do we care

360
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,950
about security what does the company do

361
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:43,260
what is security do to help the company

362
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:45,390
and enable them and then I went through

363
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:47,010
specific incidents without going into

364
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,790
too much detail so the lawyers wouldn't

365
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:50,130
get me in trouble

366
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:52,260
but actually exposing here's the attacks

367
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:54,510
we see here's the number of malware

368
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:56,910
events we had to deal with and here's

369
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:59,910
the cases where we didn't have the right

370
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:02,100
mitigating controls we went from seeing

371
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:05,610
people kind of slouched down not paying

372
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:07,950
attention to just sitting up eyes open

373
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:09,870
and people realizing sometimes that oh

374
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:11,460
he's talking about my application that's

375
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:14,310
why we had to take it down over the

376
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:15,839
weekend they get to see that impact and

377
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,540
understand that it's not just something

378
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,010
you read about

379
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:20,380
the news that happens to someone else

380
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:22,930
but why we care about it how it's

381
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:26,790
important and more importantly what is

382
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:29,560
their role in protecting the company

383
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:30,610
there are a few things that we find that

384
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,439
make these presentations really

385
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:34,210
successful and that's as Aaron alluded

386
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,800
to real-world impact follow-up and a

387
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:38,200
personal connection the verses that

388
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,459
real-world impact so for all the

389
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,410
presentations that we do we talk very

390
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,970
honestly about insensitive happened to

391
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:44,530
the company we talked about why they

392
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:45,670
happened about how they happened and

393
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:47,920
what protections we've put in place

394
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:49,390
since that we talked about you know the

395
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,979
real number of attacks we've seen the

396
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:52,750
real number of phishing emails we've

397
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:55,000
gotten things like that and a little bit

398
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:56,800
of a scary thing but a lot of it we find

399
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,710
is that for most people

400
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,719
cyber is this sort of thing that exists

401
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:03,580
is like this monster in the closet

402
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,290
and it's always going to happen to

403
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:07,000
somebody else they don't realize that it

404
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:08,890
could happen here that in fact it is

405
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,600
actively happening at our company that

406
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:12,850
we're seeing attacks every day and

407
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,920
that's just the most important thing

408
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:16,000
just making that tangible and making

409
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,800
them understand what the real-world

410
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,770
consequences of those kind of attacks

411
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:22,270
are the second thing that we do is is we

412
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:24,670
always ensure that there's a very clear

413
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:26,860
follow-up so regardless of what the

414
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:28,420
presentation is we're very clear that no

415
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:31,090
matter how excited people get they have

416
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:32,290
something tangible to do because if we

417
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:34,540
don't immediately harness that energy

418
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:35,829
from a presentation or a training and

419
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,569
they aren't asked to do something

420
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:40,240
immediate we tend to find that people

421
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:43,090
don't pay as much attention or they lose

422
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,320
interest very quickly and so that goes

423
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:46,210
along with something that Aaron and I do

424
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,340
before we have a presentation is that we

425
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:49,990
figure out who our target audience for

426
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:51,610
this presentation is and what we want

427
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:54,310
them to do so if we're gonna be a

428
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:55,900
presentation to 200 employees and 50 of

429
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:58,060
them are developers we might decide that

430
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:59,980
the thing that we want to happen is for

431
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:02,199
those 50 developers to sign up to our

432
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:04,720
application security security champions

433
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,460
program in fact we almost don't care

434
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,810
what happens to the other 150 people in

435
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:09,580
the room and it sounds a little

436
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:11,709
counterintuitive but we find that

437
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:13,300
focusing more on a smaller subset of

438
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:15,520
whoever you're talking to a training or

439
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:18,550
giving a presentation to and asking them

440
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:20,560
to take a very tangible action

441
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:22,420
afterwards is much more effective in the

442
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,430
long run than getting everyone in the

443
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,199
room generally excited about security

444
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:27,270
yeah it's a

445
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,220
we should do something about it and then

446
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:31,949
not knowing what they can do or how they

447
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:33,900
can participate in the company and the

448
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:36,060
last thing is personal connection so we

449
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,949
find that figuring out how this ties

450
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:40,109
back into people's personal lives is

451
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:41,520
really important and how the disconnects

452
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:43,680
to their company in fact this is our

453
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:46,110
chance to sort of make it fun so we

454
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,670
often like to make fun of people or you

455
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:50,790
know in my case I like to make fun of

456
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:52,439
Aaron this is actually a slide from one

457
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:53,969
of our previous talks that we gave to a

458
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:57,360
bunch of company executives where he

459
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:59,070
took a number of executives we've walked

460
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,510
them through what cyber threats are we

461
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:02,250
talked about what cyber criminals are

462
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:04,950
what nation-states are what an insider

463
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:07,500
threat is we made it kind of gamified we

464
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:09,150
talked about what those targets are and

465
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,460
how they do it so it's a relatively

466
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:13,079
basic introduction but the thing that we

467
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:14,400
married all of these two is that we

468
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,200
talked about the threat and then we

469
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,910
talked about a real-world example of an

470
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,920
incident involving that threat either

471
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:21,449
something that had happened at S&P or

472
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,939
something that was in the news that they

473
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:26,550
would have seen that they could relate

474
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:28,740
to and tying those two things together

475
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:30,510
we find really helps people because

476
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:32,160
thinking of like the black hat hoodie

477
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:35,160
hacker is a scary thing for a lot of

478
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,199
people but thinking about you know an

479
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,760
insider threat all of a sudden makes it

480
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,170
more tangible you can start to think

481
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,880
through who they concern to think

482
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:44,040
through who those actors are what they

483
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:46,230
want and it helps them really make that

484
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:49,829
concrete which helps them care more and

485
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:52,410
understand more about this and as Megan

486
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:54,570
said the real world impact is extremely

487
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:56,189
important making sure that you could tie

488
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:58,860
it in so that you can relate to the

489
00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:01,530
audience when you have your users

490
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:03,150
understanding that these headlines can

491
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:05,040
potentially be them and it could be

492
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:07,980
because of an application they worked on

493
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:10,740
or a decision that they made it helped

494
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:13,199
strike home and granted some of this can

495
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:15,930
really smack of FUD fear uncertainty and

496
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:19,020
doubt and you don't want to leave it

497
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:20,040
there but is important to show where do

498
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,920
we go from here

499
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:25,139
the most impactful part of this slide to

500
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:27,570
our employees was on the top left that

501
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:29,400
item that says Duke Energy was fined for

502
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:32,129
10 million dollars for cyber security

503
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:35,010
lapses Duke Energy didn't actually get

504
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:37,710
breached their cybersecurity governance

505
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:38,970
was just so bad that they were fined

506
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:41,730
preemptively

507
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:44,370
so now we have our employees realizing

508
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:45,659
that they've been taking shortcuts but

509
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:47,760
they've never been called on it because

510
00:17:45,659 --> 00:17:49,530
there's not been a breach but now they

511
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,330
see that regulators are taking notice

512
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:52,649
the world is taking notice and you have

513
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:55,379
to make sure you're building on

514
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:56,970
cybersecurity hygiene rather than just

515
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:00,210
bolting it on at the end so you can

516
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:02,570
avoid a fine it's extremely important to

517
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:05,700
make sure you hammer home that impact

518
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:07,970
don't scare them too much or you'll

519
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,809
drive them away but you want them

520
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:13,370
understanding that there is an actual

521
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:16,020
impact for the work that they do on

522
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:17,939
their heads mines how do you stay there

523
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:20,070
and how do you persist so there are a

524
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,870
couple things that we do a daily track

525
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:24,149
brief security role models and I see

526
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:25,590
something say something campaign my

527
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:27,030
first one our daily threat brief kind of

528
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:29,039
doubles down on what Aaron just talked

529
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:31,379
about it's exactly what it sounds like

530
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,470
we table sh a daily threat briefed on

531
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:35,549
articles that we've seen in the news

532
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:37,230
breaches that happen things that we

533
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:39,120
think are important people to know and

534
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:41,610
it goes to between two and 300 people in

535
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,139
the organization largely executives but

536
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:44,219
also some folks throughout the company

537
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,140
who have signed up for it

538
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:48,510
admittedly this is a pretty high

539
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:49,919
resource intensive task it takes an

540
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,840
analyst about three hours a day to put

541
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,970
this together we also publish a weekly

542
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,250
threat brief which takes less time and

543
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:58,350
sometimes we'll do individual blog posts

544
00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:00,870
on our company intranet site which also

545
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:02,730
take a lot less time and the really big

546
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:05,309
benefit to this is a couple of things

547
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:07,140
first of all it lets us move from being

548
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:09,210
reactive to executive questions to

549
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:11,880
proactive now when I get a question from

550
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:13,980
the CFO that says so it's oka breach oh

551
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,740
my gosh are we vulnerable what can I do

552
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:18,480
do we need to make changes typically by

553
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,580
the time an executive finds out about it

554
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,110
we've already sent something out you

555
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:24,059
know by the time of breach hits the Wall

556
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:25,110
Street Journal if you're in security you

557
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:28,010
probably already know about it through a

558
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:29,908
trust group or honestly from Twitter and

559
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:31,169
so we've already written something and

560
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:32,789
we can say hey you know three days ago

561
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:33,960
on our threat brief we said this about

562
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:35,870
the breach here's what happened here's

563
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,039
what we can do and this is provable

564
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:39,510
valuable in a number of ways we've had

565
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:40,980
people from our compliance department

566
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:43,230
tell us that this brief has helped them

567
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,970
answer questions from regulators this

568
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:46,799
has helped to introduce us to the folks

569
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:49,169
who are responsible for M&A at our

570
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:51,040
company we're now integrating security

571
00:19:49,169 --> 00:19:54,130
into the process before we do

572
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:55,659
think which is nice we've also had

573
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:56,980
people from our vendor management team

574
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:59,170
start to integrate things they've

575
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:01,020
learned into vendor discussions or when

576
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:03,160
they enter into new supplier discussions

577
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:05,260
or even the folks who work in the

578
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:07,120
business saying you know this has been

579
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:09,340
helpful for when I talk about cyber risk

580
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,860
externally and how we value that in our

581
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:13,689
company

582
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:15,219
but it's also supplemented with you know

583
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:17,110
our weekly threat brief and and blog

584
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:18,820
posts will write so we like a lot of

585
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:20,889
people to subscribe to have it phoned

586
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:22,210
alerts for our domains and so whenever

587
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:24,430
you get notifications at a large number

588
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:26,170
number of our employees have been

589
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:28,090
impacted in a breach for example the

590
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:29,620
Marriott breach or easyJet something

591
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:32,169
that they would have likely encountered

592
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:34,570
through work will publish blogs on our

593
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:36,550
internet site will send out emails and a

594
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:37,929
lot of this is just the concept of

595
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:40,210
building a relationship with people

596
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:41,020
before they have to interact with you in

597
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:43,570
a negative way

598
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:45,160
you know as Erin said a couple times if

599
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:47,050
the first time someone's hearing of you

600
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,670
is when you're screaming at them to shut

601
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:50,409
something off it's not gonna be a great

602
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:51,640
relationship but if they've already

603
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,870
gotten to know you you know they're like

604
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,490
oh you are the people who write these

605
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:56,110
briefs you're the person who told me

606
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,910
that you know my credit card was

607
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:59,770
involved in an easyJet breach and now I

608
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:01,570
need to replace it they might have a

609
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:03,370
more positive relationship here and

610
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:05,409
that's a lot of what this is doing is

611
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:08,139
sort of proactive branding and marketing

612
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:09,970
tell people who you are what you do and

613
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:11,560
how they can reach out to you so that

614
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:13,630
even if they don't necessarily read a

615
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,700
brief every day they at least know where

616
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:18,280
to go to get more information and who to

617
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:19,630
talk to to get that information when the

618
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,070
second thing ties back into the

619
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:23,380
follow-ups we just talked about so

620
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:25,389
security role models whatever we leave a

621
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:27,280
presentation we ask people to model the

622
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:28,840
security behavior it's really important

623
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,030
when it's executives or leadership teams

624
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,040
but it's just as important when you have

625
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:34,990
you know end users or developers if you

626
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,670
can convince them to model the security

627
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:38,230
behavior if you can empower them to feel

628
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,940
like they're an extension of the team as

629
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,080
though they're part of you know pushing

630
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:42,790
the company forward

631
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,710
that can be really powerful in getting

632
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:46,270
people on your side and convincing them

633
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:49,900
that this is an important thing they

634
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:51,670
need to pay attention to and the see

635
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,590
something say something campaign which

636
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:55,480
we've kind of modeled after New York's

637
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:59,020
campaign if you see something suspicious

638
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:01,840
say something we created a form takes

639
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:03,700
almost no time and users can submit

640
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,269
either with their contact information or

641
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:07,460
completely anonymous

642
00:22:05,269 --> 00:22:09,710
any type of security concern that they

643
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,999
have if they're worried about something

644
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:12,679
their managers asking them to do

645
00:22:10,999 --> 00:22:14,840
thinking they're taking a shortcut to

646
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:17,119
meet a deployment deadline if they just

647
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:19,759
observe anything suspicious they're able

648
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:21,830
to report it we make sure it is not

649
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:22,970
about blame it's not about coming down

650
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:25,158
like a ton of bricks if something's

651
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:27,159
wrong but as how security can help fix

652
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:30,169
and help prevent an issue from occurring

653
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:32,239
every single presentation we do there's

654
00:22:30,169 --> 00:22:35,359
one giant slide at the end that always

655
00:22:32,239 --> 00:22:37,129
has the name of the campaign and easy to

656
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:39,439
remember URL and an email address

657
00:22:37,129 --> 00:22:41,119
because what's really important is

658
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,340
making sure they have an easy way to

659
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:45,978
connect Megan talked about how important

660
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:48,529
a follow-up is one follow-up and every

661
00:22:45,979 --> 00:22:50,659
presentation is engage with the security

662
00:22:48,529 --> 00:22:52,999
team if you have a question reach out if

663
00:22:50,659 --> 00:22:55,399
you see something reach out

664
00:22:52,999 --> 00:22:57,229
it really helps hammer home the

665
00:22:55,399 --> 00:22:58,639
persistence making sure people know that

666
00:22:57,229 --> 00:23:00,859
the team is there that they're

667
00:22:58,639 --> 00:23:02,359
responsive that were not a team that's

668
00:23:00,859 --> 00:23:04,399
only gonna come after them that they can

669
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:07,639
actually start that dialogue without

670
00:23:04,399 --> 00:23:09,529
worrying and this campaign has actually

671
00:23:07,639 --> 00:23:11,478
been used before when people have read

672
00:23:09,529 --> 00:23:12,889
those threat briefs read about certain

673
00:23:11,479 --> 00:23:14,599
issues and then they submit it saying

674
00:23:12,889 --> 00:23:16,609
hey I just learned about this threat and

675
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:19,399
it seems that we might have an issue -

676
00:23:16,609 --> 00:23:19,908
what can we do so it helps tie it all

677
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:22,488
together

678
00:23:19,909 --> 00:23:24,619
and make it a little more cohesive and

679
00:23:22,489 --> 00:23:31,309
build a better relationship with our

680
00:23:24,619 --> 00:23:34,220
users so let's talk a little bit about

681
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:35,840
lateral movement how do we actually get

682
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:38,119
people to now start talking to each

683
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:40,399
other to work with each other to spread

684
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:42,080
the knowledge throughout the company so

685
00:23:40,399 --> 00:23:44,268
the first item we'll talk about is

686
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,340
internal collaboration which is a nice

687
00:23:44,269 --> 00:23:49,429
flowery sounding buzzword just like

688
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:51,080
synergistic management solutions whose

689
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:54,859
domain is already registered I tried to

690
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:56,658
buy it but internal collaboration what

691
00:23:54,859 --> 00:23:58,879
we've ended up doing is after some of

692
00:23:56,659 --> 00:24:00,830
those presentations we then reached out

693
00:23:58,879 --> 00:24:03,830
to our public affairs team who manages

694
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:05,720
our internal external communications Rp

695
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:08,658
our relationship with regulators and

696
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:10,879
entities and they invited us to speak at

697
00:24:08,659 --> 00:24:13,249
their off-site - all - all of their

698
00:24:10,879 --> 00:24:14,869
staff we ran a tabletop exercise but

699
00:24:13,249 --> 00:24:17,239
instead of doing a generic incident

700
00:24:14,869 --> 00:24:18,428
response exercise we made sure it was

701
00:24:17,239 --> 00:24:20,320
tailored with their tee

702
00:24:18,429 --> 00:24:22,779
we worked closely with them to build

703
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:25,539
that program so when we ran the exercise

704
00:24:22,779 --> 00:24:27,869
they got to see how important crisis PR

705
00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:30,100
might be in the event of an incident if

706
00:24:27,869 --> 00:24:32,590
someone if a researcher posts online

707
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:34,869
that ransomware hit our company they're

708
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:37,749
gonna need to be prepared very quickly

709
00:24:34,869 --> 00:24:39,369
to respond and they didn't really have

710
00:24:37,749 --> 00:24:40,960
templates before they don't really think

711
00:24:39,369 --> 00:24:43,570
about what's needed from the cyber side

712
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,610
so having that engagement collaboration

713
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:48,749
led to a lot of work products being

714
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:51,008
created templates procedures processes

715
00:24:48,749 --> 00:24:53,440
that they just never had before

716
00:24:51,009 --> 00:24:55,840
we've delivered training on business

717
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,190
email compromised to some people who at

718
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,658
first had thought that they had never

719
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:00,879
received a phishing email in their life

720
00:24:58,659 --> 00:25:02,740
and that no one would ever go after them

721
00:25:00,879 --> 00:25:05,469
but they worked in our procurement team

722
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:08,259
so we make sure to educate on why it's

723
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:10,480
important how to identify it but then

724
00:25:08,259 --> 00:25:12,909
also what happens if a customer was

725
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,879
breached and someone is spoofing our

726
00:25:12,909 --> 00:25:18,399
brand to get information from a customer

727
00:25:15,879 --> 00:25:21,070
to get them to send money they come to

728
00:25:18,399 --> 00:25:23,379
us yelling and we have to make sure that

729
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:25,509
our customer engagement personnel are

730
00:25:23,379 --> 00:25:27,279
trained on how to respond what the issue

731
00:25:25,509 --> 00:25:30,129
could potentially be and who to talk to

732
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:32,350
it's extremely extremely important we

733
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:34,330
talk about this a lot you have to reach

734
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:37,480
out be that person that reaches out to

735
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:39,220
other teams learn what they do and learn

736
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:42,249
how security can help them and be an

737
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:45,490
enabler shift that mindset from security

738
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:47,440
as a cost center to security as a value

739
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:49,149
add to the point where we have had our

740
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,669
sales representatives actually now

741
00:25:49,149 --> 00:25:56,289
talking about security initiatives as a

742
00:25:51,669 --> 00:25:57,970
way to sell our products internal

743
00:25:56,289 --> 00:26:00,129
collaboration can sometimes sound kind

744
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:01,240
of fluffy as Erin said but the really

745
00:26:00,129 --> 00:26:03,699
important thing to remember about this

746
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,409
is it doesn't necessarily require a lot

747
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:08,440
more effort than things you're already

748
00:26:05,409 --> 00:26:09,940
doing the difference is is that you're

749
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,980
doing them but maybe set up a couple of

750
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:13,119
proactive conversations it's you know

751
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:14,980
the same thing we've been harping on

752
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:17,678
here is that you know call up your for

753
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:19,090
example your physical security team have

754
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,490
a chat with them get a conversation

755
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:24,850
going much before the instance happens

756
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:26,919
so when coronavirus hit in New York v

757
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:29,049
are actually well before that would grow

758
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:31,059
and we realize Cronos going to be hard

759
00:26:29,049 --> 00:26:31,720
to leave the threat it is now our

760
00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:33,220
physical secure

761
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,510
instead of having a working group you

762
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:36,039
know they want to talk about what job is

763
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,390
you should be close how do we close them

764
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:39,490
how do we proceed how can we make sure

765
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:42,340
everyone is safe as they move home and

766
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:43,720
they immediately offered a couple of

767
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:45,220
students to or threat Intel team they

768
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,470
asked us to be involved they wanted our

769
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:48,909
input from the beginning and that's the

770
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:52,539
kind of outcome we're looking for here

771
00:26:48,909 --> 00:26:53,860
it's not just that because we'd already

772
00:26:52,539 --> 00:26:55,179
built a relationship with them and

773
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:56,500
because we've had a lot of conversations

774
00:26:55,179 --> 00:26:58,450
with them about hey this is what we can

775
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:00,039
provide you how can we support you what

776
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,690
are your intelligence requirements what

777
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:03,158
can we do for you that then we're

778
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:05,320
invited to have that seat at the table

779
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:07,000
when it mattered and those kind of

780
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:08,500
relationships as Aaron is saying are

781
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,390
really important building those in

782
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:12,220
advance of when you want to be invited

783
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:14,530
to the meeting so that when whatever the

784
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:16,210
incident is happens that you're you know

785
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:17,889
invested in them and you're involved in

786
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:19,539
those conversations because sometimes

787
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:20,890
just getting the right seat at the table

788
00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:23,350
and being invited through our meetings

789
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:24,610
is unfortunately so much of us being

790
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:26,908
able to get our job done

791
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:30,158
and being able to get our messaging out

792
00:27:26,909 --> 00:27:31,690
and again in sort of this goes there our

793
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,640
next one employee resource group kind of

794
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:35,470
throws back to the personal connection

795
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:37,270
part so I'm not sure if you guys have

796
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:38,559
them but our IT company and a lot of

797
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:40,030
leather large companies have what's

798
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,850
called an employee resource group which

799
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:44,678
are groups for employees to get together

800
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:46,689
they run events there are a lot more

801
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:48,580
informal often you know the bad thing

802
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:50,020
about getting a security presentation is

803
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:51,879
even if you give the world's best

804
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:53,590
security presentation no one's excited

805
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,539
to be at your presentation they're

806
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:57,399
already driving being there there's a

807
00:27:55,539 --> 00:27:59,080
good chance that they won't intake a lot

808
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:01,870
of that information and even if they do

809
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:03,760
intake that information they're probably

810
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:05,649
not that excited about it but if you can

811
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,240
go meet them where they're already at

812
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:09,880
for example with an employee resource

813
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:11,110
group where they've already volunteered

814
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,330
this is something they're spending their

815
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:15,340
free time to do and you can present and

816
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:17,260
work with one of these groups then

817
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:18,490
you're getting people sort of when their

818
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:21,429
guard is down a little bit and they're

819
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:22,390
more receptive to your message so we

820
00:28:21,429 --> 00:28:24,039
have a call a lot of quite a few

821
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:25,390
employee resource groups or one of them

822
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:28,299
we've worked with pretty closely is a

823
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:30,700
group for parents and that's enabled us

824
00:28:28,299 --> 00:28:33,639
to give presentations on you know how to

825
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:35,110
protect your kids online how can you

826
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:37,750
protect yourself so that what they're

827
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:38,860
doing online is safe how can you use you

828
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:40,630
know sort of some privacy software

829
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:41,659
around them what should and should you

830
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:44,090
post on social media

831
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:45,590
and especially in the time where we're

832
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:48,020
looking at a lot more remote workforce

833
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:49,879
having employees who understand how to

834
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:51,710
secure their home networks you know

835
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:54,110
someone who understands what an IOT

836
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:56,990
device is and maybe how to deal with it

837
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:58,969
and also you know how to update the

838
00:28:56,990 --> 00:29:00,740
firmware on your router things like that

839
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:02,090
which people you know no one wants to

840
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,710
learn how to do but often when it's

841
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:05,899
framed in terms of hey this is how you

842
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:08,330
can protect your kids or this is how you

843
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:09,920
can protect yourself at home rather than

844
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:12,740
seeing it as a work commitment can

845
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:14,240
really help people it helps them to you

846
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:16,160
know understand why these things are

847
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,380
important and understand what to do and

848
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,460
you know particularly when everyone's

849
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:21,020
are working from home it's really

850
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:23,690
important that you have a secure home

851
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:25,400
work setup but even when you're not you

852
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:26,930
know people who practice good cyber

853
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,640
behavior at home are more likely to

854
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:30,770
bring that behavior into work and so

855
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,170
enforcing those habits as much as you

856
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:35,030
can it can be a really good thing and in

857
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:36,470
addition it's another chance for you to

858
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:37,760
sort of help people out you know you're

859
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:39,980
trying to help them protect their kids

860
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,570
or to protect their families online this

861
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:44,090
is another chance for you to build a

862
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:45,830
relationship that's positive that you

863
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:47,750
know now they like the security team

864
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:49,220
hopefully they want to interact with

865
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:50,720
them they want to learn more and they

866
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:53,090
feel comfortable reaching out to you

867
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,890
whether it's about this whether it's

868
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:56,419
about you know something really serious

869
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:58,940
a lot of times after we give these

870
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:00,680
presentations I get 50 emails asking me

871
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:02,750
for a password manager recommendation

872
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:05,960
and one email telling me about a really

873
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:07,370
important security concern and to me

874
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,750
it's worth it because you could have to

875
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:10,399
wait to these 50 emails and tell people

876
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:13,130
that I want to use you know this

877
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:15,020
password manager then getting that one

878
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:17,060
security concern is really really

879
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:18,980
important and to me is worth the sort of

880
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:21,169
relationship we've built there and

881
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:22,910
what's important to think about is like

882
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:25,880
you're hearing this theme a lot about

883
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:27,650
building a relationship that if you have

884
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,300
one takeaway we talked about our

885
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:32,660
outcomes presentation here your homework

886
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:35,090
is to find someone in the business find

887
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:36,710
someone outside of the team and just

888
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:40,250
strike a conversation learn about what

889
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:42,100
they do the act of you being present at

890
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:45,260
a meeting or at one of these events

891
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:46,850
talking to those groups you already get

892
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:49,100
people talking remembering your name

893
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:50,959
remembering your team next time

894
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:53,480
something happens it's easier for them

895
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,460
to recognize one of the exercises we did

896
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:58,010
with an employee resource group which

897
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:59,990
called valor which is for our veterans

898
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:02,960
they were hosting a tabletop exercise

899
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:05,029
with West Point cadets and they wanted

900
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,279
to have a cyber element as part of the

901
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:08,570
tabletop exercise because as making

902
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:11,000
point out we'd started building that

903
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:13,610
relationship with the team they invited

904
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,380
me over and we started working out how

905
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:17,959
do we build a cyber element to the

906
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:20,480
tabletop exercise that was extremely

907
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:22,760
well received we had we got a lot of

908
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,250
positive feedback from the general from

909
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:27,440
West Point cadets and from the people

910
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:29,149
that ran this to the point where when

911
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,309
they have other events or other groups

912
00:31:29,149 --> 00:31:33,320
they reach out to us early on rather

913
00:31:31,309 --> 00:31:36,980
than kind of tagging it on and asking us

914
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:39,918
later the last thing here is security

915
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:42,700
champions security champions I will warn

916
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:45,559
you are both a lot of work and a huge

917
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:47,419
investors so I think most security

918
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:49,490
champions can programs can be broadly

919
00:31:47,419 --> 00:31:51,559
categorized into two groups both the

920
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:53,270
sort of general user awareness champions

921
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:55,340
which is where you're asking essentially

922
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:58,850
anyone to join and you're providing some

923
00:31:55,340 --> 00:32:00,230
basic level of training and then you're

924
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:02,389
asking them to help help out with

925
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:03,679
activity is generally often security

926
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:05,270
awareness type activities there's

927
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,070
probably not a huge requirement on them

928
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:08,570
and then the second part of this or the

929
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:10,520
second most popular kind is an

930
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:12,379
application security champion which is

931
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:14,510
typically run by application security

932
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:16,250
team it's for developers it's a very

933
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:18,200
formalized program where there's a

934
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:20,090
series of steps and at the end of it you

935
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,010
know they're often able to do their own

936
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:24,020
code reviews to you know sort of remove

937
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:25,250
some of the load from the security team

938
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:30,710
and they're seen as essentially an

939
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:32,480
extension of the security team and so we

940
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:34,580
have one we started in a couple years

941
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:38,120
ago we have two tracks one is for our

942
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:40,220
application security you know track and

943
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:42,529
which is for developers and one is for

944
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:44,360
our you know everyday folk anyone who

945
00:32:42,529 --> 00:32:45,950
wants to join and they have roughly

946
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,899
quarterly training we brought a little

947
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:50,450
bit of training and they can help run

948
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:52,158
some exercises for example we had a

949
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:55,460
group in India last year where we were

950
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:57,470
running some escape room the security

951
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:59,480
escape room theme trainings for all of

952
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:01,130
the employees in the area and we had

953
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,779
security champions and who helped us out

954
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:04,730
to run that exercise and that was really

955
00:33:02,779 --> 00:33:07,370
helpful for that the application

956
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:08,620
security team works to create a more

957
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:10,929
formalized program which

958
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:12,309
we said helps enable developers to lift

959
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:14,830
some of the load from the security team

960
00:33:12,309 --> 00:33:16,840
this one's a little more informal and

961
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:18,100
honestly this isn't something that I

962
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,809
think is a strength about it this is

963
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,189
something we're still working one of the

964
00:33:19,809 --> 00:33:23,800
things that we didn't expect when we

965
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:25,510
created this program was how much his

966
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:27,580
people would want to join it we thought

967
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:29,590
you know maybe would be lucky 20 people

968
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:32,050
to show up in a room and it turned out

969
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:33,520
we had hundreds and I will say that if

970
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:35,440
you're considering starting a security

971
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:37,300
champions program have a lot of

972
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,770
resources in place because I think these

973
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:40,149
programs can take anywhere from a couple

974
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:42,370
hours a month if you're offering

975
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:44,830
quarterly trainings to a full-time

976
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:46,689
dedicated person if you have a program

977
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:48,189
that continues to go on or very

978
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:51,460
formalized program with a lot of

979
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:54,550
requirements and as Megan mentioned the

980
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:56,920
escaper in training and that was

981
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:59,889
actually a really great example of the

982
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:01,600
champions coming together people started

983
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:03,940
taking the security champions title

984
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,010
essentially as bragging rights they were

985
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:07,840
talking to their friends I'm a security

986
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:09,520
champion this is really cool this is

987
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:12,279
what I'm doing they were really excited

988
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,870
helping out with that training helping

989
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:17,620
with the questions learning about it

990
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:18,940
being involved a lot of times back to

991
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:21,549
one of those first slides where we think

992
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:24,220
users don't care about security taking

993
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:26,950
aside that exception whew that may not

994
00:34:24,219 --> 00:34:28,719
care people just need to be educated

995
00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:30,520
they want to be involved and they want

996
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,560
to be consulted it's much easier to

997
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:34,810
spread the security knowledge to build

998
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,879
that culture if you include people and

999
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:39,790
empower them the benefit of that

1000
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:41,679
application security side where we will

1001
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:44,230
teach the developers how to actually

1002
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,550
perform the scans themselves it gets

1003
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:47,350
them more interested we've had

1004
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:49,360
developers reach out saying I know you

1005
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:51,790
guys find cross-site scripting or sequel

1006
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:53,679
injection flaws I want to learn how I

1007
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:55,449
could do that when I develop so we don't

1008
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:58,570
have to wait till the end and consume

1009
00:34:55,449 --> 00:35:00,220
cycles fixing it I want to learn people

1010
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:02,560
are curious and they want to learn and I

1011
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:04,480
think one of the areas where we

1012
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,710
definitely have to improve on as Megan

1013
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,870
said is building that now because we

1014
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:09,280
have so much interest so it was a lot

1015
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:11,710
more time commitment than we had

1016
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,810
initially thought if I was gonna do it

1017
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:15,790
over I may think of targeting just

1018
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:19,390
smaller groups using them as a pilot to

1019
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:22,060
incubate it but the type of passion is

1020
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:24,069
there it just takes the out

1021
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:27,160
reach and empowering those individuals

1022
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:28,900
to get some great results and this is a

1023
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:31,330
very which we've learned a lot from our

1024
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:33,220
peers for example Geico has a fantastic

1025
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:35,200
security champions program for your

1026
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:37,450
average end-user we've talked to folks

1027
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:40,000
at Merritt code who have a really great

1028
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:41,520
program for application security teams

1029
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,690
and I think this type of collaboration

1030
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,190
information sharing on security

1031
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:46,450
champions programs can be hugely

1032
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:47,950
beneficial

1033
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:49,149
we definitely have some space to grow

1034
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:51,970
but it's something that we're very

1035
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:54,280
actively focused on working on since we

1036
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:56,830
think it's one of the best ways to build

1037
00:35:54,280 --> 00:36:00,070
that relationship and also physically

1038
00:35:56,830 --> 00:36:01,600
reduce the load on the security team and

1039
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:03,460
to that point there was a question that

1040
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:05,650
came in through discord that I think

1041
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:07,450
does relate about how OSHA trainings

1042
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:11,470
have evolved to create a safety culture

1043
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:13,029
and can we learn so what I think is

1044
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:16,120
really important though the office of

1045
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:18,940
safety and hazard it's really really

1046
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:20,819
important to build that culture and the

1047
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:23,740
way that they approach trainings is

1048
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:26,620
training management training individuals

1049
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:29,020
so that it trickles down it permeates

1050
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:30,730
every part of the company that's what

1051
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,200
your security champions really are going

1052
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:34,570
to do they are going to be the backbone

1053
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:37,149
of that culture shift where you're

1054
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:38,950
empowering them to make secure decisions

1055
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:40,720
you're backing them up you're enabling

1056
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:42,430
them you're not hoarding all the tools

1057
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,950
for yourself all the knowledge for

1058
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:46,899
yourself you're sharing it out you're

1059
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:48,399
teaching them how to fish and they

1060
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,900
appreciate that and then they spread

1061
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,630
that knowledge on throughout their own

1062
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:57,940
teams so we are really excited seeing

1063
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:59,140
where that's gonna go this year finally

1064
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:01,480
now that you've won the hearts and minds

1065
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:02,680
how do you stop being so much of a cost

1066
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:05,410
center for the business and how do you

1067
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:07,240
become a value-add so this is gonna vary

1068
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:10,120
a lot based on your company and what it

1069
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:11,859
is that you do for us we have a division

1070
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:14,020
called SMT global ratings which for

1071
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:16,960
those of you who are not familiar they

1072
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:21,730
wait the likelihood of companies country

1073
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:23,860
as municipalities and places to pay down

1074
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:25,750
their debt so their goal is to tell you

1075
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:29,260
how likely that someone is to default on

1076
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:31,150
their bonds or their debt and a couple

1077
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:32,049
of months ago after so one of the rating

1078
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:33,969
analysts had

1079
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:35,259
attended a training we've given they

1080
00:37:33,969 --> 00:37:37,119
came to us and they said you know what

1081
00:37:35,259 --> 00:37:38,499
we're seeing a ton of municipalities in

1082
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:41,049
the United States have made ransomware

1083
00:37:38,499 --> 00:37:42,578
attacks and quite frankly you know this

1084
00:37:41,049 --> 00:37:44,259
is hugely damaging to their credit

1085
00:37:42,579 --> 00:37:46,719
because they're forced to either pay

1086
00:37:44,259 --> 00:37:49,390
ransoms or pay huge sums two consultants

1087
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:51,880
or to revamp their security program or

1088
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:53,739
in some cases to completely change over

1089
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:56,140
overhaul their IT infrastructure and

1090
00:37:53,739 --> 00:37:58,089
they said we don't understand what

1091
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:59,679
questions to ask we don't understand

1092
00:37:58,089 --> 00:38:01,089
what answers they should be giving and

1093
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:02,469
quite frankly there's a lot of

1094
00:38:01,089 --> 00:38:04,689
understanding of some of the technical

1095
00:38:02,469 --> 00:38:07,119
components of ransomware so we needed

1096
00:38:04,689 --> 00:38:08,439
training for the ratings analyst in one

1097
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,839
of our business divisions and we talked

1098
00:38:08,439 --> 00:38:12,999
to them about what ransomware is about

1099
00:38:10,839 --> 00:38:14,828
how it impacts municipalities and came

1100
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:15,999
up with a set of questions in concert

1101
00:38:14,829 --> 00:38:17,859
with them that they could ask

1102
00:38:15,999 --> 00:38:20,558
municipalities to assess sort of their

1103
00:38:17,859 --> 00:38:22,150
security posture and some information so

1104
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:24,069
they can understand the responses they

1105
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:27,039
get back so they would understand you

1106
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:28,509
know not only what kind of protection

1107
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:30,130
should someone have in place against

1108
00:38:28,509 --> 00:38:33,459
ransomware but you know what does that

1109
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:35,049
mean and that was a really big shift in

1110
00:38:33,459 --> 00:38:36,219
our turning point for us because it was

1111
00:38:35,049 --> 00:38:38,469
the first time you know we had this

1112
00:38:36,219 --> 00:38:40,119
relationship or not gesture do we have a

1113
00:38:38,469 --> 00:38:41,739
relationship with you know a physical

1114
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:43,900
security team which broadly has the same

1115
00:38:41,739 --> 00:38:45,579
goals as us or you know relationship

1116
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:47,439
that's directly relevant to what we do

1117
00:38:45,579 --> 00:38:49,929
but rather we're actively helping the

1118
00:38:47,439 --> 00:38:51,339
business side of the organization and

1119
00:38:49,929 --> 00:38:54,160
that's something we have on a lot but

1120
00:38:51,339 --> 00:38:56,319
it's really really important we actually

1121
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:58,029
have you know a series of people come in

1122
00:38:56,319 --> 00:39:00,459
and talk to us about what it is the

1123
00:38:58,029 --> 00:39:02,589
business does we work for a very large

1124
00:39:00,459 --> 00:39:03,969
complex financial services company that

1125
00:39:02,589 --> 00:39:05,529
has a lot of different business lines

1126
00:39:03,969 --> 00:39:07,029
and just a lot of different things to

1127
00:39:05,529 --> 00:39:08,469
make money we think it's really

1128
00:39:07,029 --> 00:39:10,660
important for the security team to

1129
00:39:08,469 --> 00:39:12,880
understand how the business makes money

1130
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:14,558
at a very concrete level because that

1131
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,869
helps inform our threat model if we

1132
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:18,249
don't understand what they're doing and

1133
00:39:16,869 --> 00:39:20,319
how they're doing it then we're not

1134
00:39:18,249 --> 00:39:21,759
going to understand you know what

1135
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:23,410
information is most important to them

1136
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:24,759
what their crown jewels are and what

1137
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:27,308
kind of threats they're worried about

1138
00:39:24,759 --> 00:39:29,739
impacting them so that's something we

1139
00:39:27,309 --> 00:39:31,239
focus on very heavily is to understand

1140
00:39:29,739 --> 00:39:34,029
where the business is coming from and

1141
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:35,650
how we can add value to that and that's

1142
00:39:34,029 --> 00:39:38,229
a really good point about understanding

1143
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:39,880
the business as an example of you if

1144
00:39:38,229 --> 00:39:42,399
you're the New York Stock Exchange and

1145
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:43,509
you're trying to tell them well you have

1146
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,829
an application that is cross-site

1147
00:39:43,509 --> 00:39:46,250
scripting and that's listed as a

1148
00:39:44,829 --> 00:39:49,110
critical vulnerable

1149
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:50,970
the tool might listed is critical but if

1150
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:53,040
that's an internal only system and they

1151
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:55,230
tell you we have a problem over here

1152
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:57,360
with latency and if this server takes

1153
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:59,640
too long to respond we have to close the

1154
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,900
market for the day they're gonna care

1155
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,609
more about that than they are about the

1156
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:04,230
cross-site scripting so it's important

1157
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:07,110
for you to understand how they make

1158
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:08,700
money and the context of the business so

1159
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:11,340
that you can give more accurate and

1160
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:13,799
informed guidance which helps build that

1161
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:17,100
trust with with your customers with your

1162
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:18,930
business entities and what we've also

1163
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:20,490
done to help kind of share out the

1164
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:22,680
knowledge that everyone's got his

1165
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:24,180
external conferences and I'm not talking

1166
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,980
about Megan and I presenting at

1167
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:28,169
something like this I'm talking about

1168
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:29,910
our business leaders who attend

1169
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:31,770
different conferences in the course of

1170
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:33,990
their day when they whether it's at the

1171
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:35,009
World Economic Forum or any other areas

1172
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:36,600
where they talk about market

1173
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:38,670
intelligence they talk about how our

1174
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,890
data affects the market or different

1175
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:42,590
trends we're seeing they can now apply

1176
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:45,390
of security lends to it

1177
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:46,680
security is permeated everything if

1178
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:49,710
you're an investor you're asking

1179
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:52,230
questions about security so they are now

1180
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:54,540
taking the steps to learn about it and

1181
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:56,130
how it impacts the market how it impacts

1182
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:58,320
buying decisions mergers and

1183
00:40:56,130 --> 00:41:00,510
acquisitions you saw with the

1184
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,950
acquisition of Yahoo by Verizon the

1185
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:03,390
breach information knocked down their

1186
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:07,200
price by millions and millions of

1187
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:08,790
dollars making sure that our executives

1188
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,859
are able to talk about this that they're

1189
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:12,540
giving presentations and they're seen as

1190
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:14,880
thought leaders and trusts and that they

1191
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:16,560
know about security is extremely

1192
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:20,760
important one of the best wins that

1193
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:23,279
we've had and what I want to take some

1194
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:25,550
time to talk about is what outcomes did

1195
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,690
we think we would actually have from

1196
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:29,940
giving these types of presentations

1197
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:30,480
because like most security teams that

1198
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:32,970
I'm aware of

1199
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:35,880
and definitely myself at times we have a

1200
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:38,399
very cynical outlook on life we don't

1201
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:40,440
think things might get better we think

1202
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,550
people aren't gonna try and to be honest

1203
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:43,740
for some of the presentations we

1204
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:45,600
initially thought it's gonna be another

1205
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:46,859
presentation it's a PowerPoint people

1206
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:50,190
will listen because they're told to and

1207
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:53,850
they'll move on that actually wasn't the

1208
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:55,920
case instead of people just slouching

1209
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:59,000
around on their phones waiting for the

1210
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:01,490
talks to end we had

1211
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,830
so many more user questions users

1212
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:05,540
reaching out constantly to Megan's point

1213
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:07,730
earlier fifty people are messaging about

1214
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:09,430
password managers or security concerns

1215
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:11,570
that's fifty more than we had before

1216
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:13,430
we're spreading that message we're

1217
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:15,740
working with them they're asking

1218
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:17,330
questions about how do I use a password

1219
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:20,060
manager and how do I think about using

1220
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:21,590
it at home with my family when I'm

1221
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:23,690
signing up the fact that we had a CFO

1222
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:26,540
ask us about credential stuffing attacks

1223
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:28,180
and learning about what those were was

1224
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:30,290
huge we never had that before

1225
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:31,669
we're really increasing our

1226
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:33,710
collaboration with different teams

1227
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:36,650
working with different groups talking to

1228
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:39,560
people we try to get in our daily

1229
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:41,330
meetings every other week one of those

1230
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:43,250
meetings gets repurposed to allow

1231
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:45,049
someone from either outside the company

1232
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:48,170
or within the company to be a guest

1233
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:50,180
speaker build relationships to help us

1234
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:53,030
learn what are other people doing how

1235
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:55,279
can we fit in and help we've actually

1236
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:58,340
affected some policy changes so Gregory

1237
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:00,740
Madden yesterday talked about potential

1238
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:03,620
needs for consequences when it comes to

1239
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:05,629
fishing people fail and continuously if

1240
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:12,049
someone fails 11 out of 12 times in a

1241
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:14,360
year when that happens we now have HR

1242
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:15,800
and compliance came to us about we

1243
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:18,320
should probably have consequences here

1244
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:20,120
because doesn't that put us at risk so

1245
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:21,470
now we have if you fail too many times

1246
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:24,500
you're gonna have a conversation with

1247
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:25,580
your manager with HR potentially be put

1248
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:28,100
on a performance plan or other

1249
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:29,810
disciplinary measures we're gonna

1250
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:31,310
finally have some consequences for the

1251
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:33,799
people that keep trying to watch porn in

1252
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:36,620
the office I don't know why they don't

1253
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:38,300
think we can't see that people that try

1254
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:40,430
to connect their personal devices on to

1255
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:43,460
the network because they want to run

1256
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:45,980
BitTorrent it's important that we're

1257
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:48,080
affecting that change in policy with

1258
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:49,760
partnership through risk compliance

1259
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:52,370
rather than us trying to force it down

1260
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:54,410
and then we've had a lot more

1261
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:55,970
opportunities for trainings as Megan

1262
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:59,450
said we've done this probably at least

1263
00:43:55,970 --> 00:44:02,209
ten times that initial training and we

1264
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:04,009
sometimes still do variations of that we

1265
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:05,930
have other members of security such as

1266
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:07,970
the application security team that's

1267
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:10,009
hosted capture-the-flag tournaments that

1268
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:12,879
have hosted just secure development

1269
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:14,529
training workshops there's a lot of up

1270
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,720
tunity and the security awareness team

1271
00:44:14,529 --> 00:44:19,569
are great partners to help arrange these

1272
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:22,779
but having the subject matter experts

1273
00:44:19,569 --> 00:44:25,029
available for advice answering questions

1274
00:44:22,779 --> 00:44:26,740
they are rather than taking it after the

1275
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:32,109
training has happened has been

1276
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:33,758
invaluable so we going from here to

1277
00:44:32,109 --> 00:44:36,069
enlightenment and beyond

1278
00:44:33,759 --> 00:44:37,509
basically we the things were working on

1279
00:44:36,069 --> 00:44:38,170
over the next year are as we talked

1280
00:44:37,509 --> 00:44:39,970
about earlier

1281
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:41,349
our security champions program we'd like

1282
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:43,538
to strengthen that we'd like to make it

1283
00:44:41,349 --> 00:44:45,490
a little more formal to find more ways

1284
00:44:43,539 --> 00:44:47,650
to leverage our security champions to

1285
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:49,868
support initiatives that's a really big

1286
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:51,789
one for us and the other big one is our

1287
00:44:49,869 --> 00:44:53,650
fishing program as Aaron talked about

1288
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:57,250
we've implemented consequences and we've

1289
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:59,349
also started doing a lot more targeted

1290
00:44:57,250 --> 00:45:01,000
training we've decided that we have some

1291
00:44:59,349 --> 00:45:03,250
more time down a little more resourcing

1292
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,990
to figure out what works best and so

1293
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:07,480
what we did over the last year was

1294
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:10,000
launched a number of spear phishing

1295
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:11,680
attacks against divisions and we first

1296
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,539
looked very closely at what type of

1297
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:15,700
phishing emails were receiving so we

1298
00:45:13,539 --> 00:45:17,259
based all of the spear fishes we sent an

1299
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:18,759
email as we'd seen we were seeing a lot

1300
00:45:17,259 --> 00:45:20,230
of type of squatting of our domain so we

1301
00:45:18,759 --> 00:45:21,640
started buying your own type of squat

1302
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:25,690
serve our domain to use for phishing

1303
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:27,190
tests we'd also noticed we had a lot of

1304
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:29,980
executive spoofing so we started

1305
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:32,319
spoofing our own executives we caught

1306
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:33,910
mocked up our logo mocked our signature

1307
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:36,308
block did a lot of background research

1308
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:37,569
in order to create them and then we sent

1309
00:45:36,309 --> 00:45:39,400
them to Oliver who sent three

1310
00:45:37,569 --> 00:45:41,529
increasingly difficult fishes to both a

1311
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:44,259
financer operations team and what we

1312
00:45:41,529 --> 00:45:46,329
found was that the people who fell for

1313
00:45:44,259 --> 00:45:47,890
the initial phishing emails were

1314
00:45:46,329 --> 00:45:49,960
actually less likely to fall for

1315
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:51,490
subsequent phishing emails in fact they

1316
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:53,259
were actually less likely to fall for

1317
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:54,578
any more phishing emails for the next

1318
00:45:53,259 --> 00:45:57,220
three months after about three months

1319
00:45:54,579 --> 00:46:00,759
the effect dropped off and over the same

1320
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:02,980
time period we saw rates reporting rates

1321
00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:04,900
go up so the people who'd been involved

1322
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:06,220
in our experience or in our experiment

1323
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:10,630
which were a couple hundred employees

1324
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:13,209
reported roughly 25% higher rates than

1325
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:15,130
the rest of our employee population in

1326
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:17,049
other words sending the phishing emails

1327
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:19,359
and then actually falling for phishing

1328
00:46:17,049 --> 00:46:20,859
emails meant that they were much less

1329
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:23,319
likely evolved for both real phishing

1330
00:46:20,859 --> 00:46:24,339
emails and subsequent tests as well as

1331
00:46:23,319 --> 00:46:25,880
they were more likely to report

1332
00:46:24,339 --> 00:46:27,230
suspicious emails

1333
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:29,990
and we found that this was really

1334
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:33,170
important for us and we want to continue

1335
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:34,520
doing these types of tests throughout

1336
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:37,190
the business to see what type of

1337
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:39,320
training works best how we can improve

1338
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:41,030
these programs and these are not

1339
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:42,290
included in our fishing consequence

1340
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:44,360
management and they're sent out

1341
00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:47,060
individually to departments but we're

1342
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:50,330
hoping to expand some more of this as

1343
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:52,160
well just to to see what kind of

1344
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:53,750
training works best in and the thing we

1345
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,609
found is most important too is that we

1346
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:57,110
were crafting spear phishing emails the

1347
00:46:55,610 --> 00:46:58,820
spear phishing emails are incredibly

1348
00:46:57,110 --> 00:47:00,110
reflective of what we're actually seeing

1349
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:01,940
you know if you're not seeing type of

1350
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:05,030
swatting domains don't type a squawk

1351
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:06,860
domains but then we also have when the

1352
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:08,510
education pops up and you know an email

1353
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:10,280
goes out to them afterwards it says you

1354
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:12,230
know hey here's why we sent this here's

1355
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:14,210
the real fish that we got that we you

1356
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:15,860
know based this on and this is why this

1357
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:17,690
is so important and again it's sort of

1358
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:20,480
connecting this back to this real world

1359
00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:22,970
impact that we find is is very important

1360
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,350
so people can understand when we're

1361
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:26,689
launching these phishing emails and

1362
00:47:24,350 --> 00:47:28,640
we're not to get to we want you to learn

1363
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:30,110
we want you to have some space to fail

1364
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,879
which is what the spear phishing emails

1365
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:33,980
are at apart from our general phishing

1366
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:35,690
and also we want to be able to the

1367
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:37,670
training to be more targeted and more

1368
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:39,590
real-world so it's actually relevant to

1369
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:42,140
what people are doing and that we think

1370
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:44,810
is really important yeah we're also

1371
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:46,310
working a lot on is gonna sound boring

1372
00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:48,950
at first but on our logging capabilities

1373
00:47:46,310 --> 00:47:50,630
no company have seen logs everything the

1374
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:52,040
way they want but through our

1375
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:53,810
partnerships with the different groups

1376
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:55,759
now we have a lot more buy-in and

1377
00:47:53,810 --> 00:47:58,400
support to get the logs security needs

1378
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:00,320
to do their jobs because by going to the

1379
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:03,200
messaging team and saying we need email

1380
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:04,850
logs and also if we had those you can

1381
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,589
access them so you're troubleshooting

1382
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:08,839
will be much easier and you can do your

1383
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:10,940
job in easier fashion they're suddenly

1384
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:14,390
on board and now we can't get the logs

1385
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:15,950
fast enough so building out what we can

1386
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:18,830
do from our monitoring side by engaging

1387
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:20,629
the right teams and actually

1388
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:22,250
collaborating them asking them what they

1389
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:24,980
might need what fields are useful to

1390
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:27,500
them what are their use cases and having

1391
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:30,170
that shared access and platform has

1392
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:31,700
really helped just improve our

1393
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:33,140
relationship with the teams to the point

1394
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:35,779
where they start suggesting stuff we

1395
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:38,629
didn't even know we had and helping us

1396
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:39,630
automate a lot more one of our goals was

1397
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:41,220
to

1398
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:42,870
prove our automation this year everyone

1399
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:44,970
talks about it

1400
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:46,980
some people will buy expensive soar

1401
00:48:44,970 --> 00:48:49,049
products or developers will create some

1402
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:50,580
really cool PowerShell scripts but at

1403
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:52,680
the end of the day for your automation

1404
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:54,210
to really work in a security team you

1405
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:56,040
still have to work with all the other

1406
00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:58,080
teams in your company to understand

1407
00:48:56,040 --> 00:49:00,390
what's valuable get access to those

1408
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:02,130
systems to make the changes and make

1409
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:04,770
sure you're not disrupting the business

1410
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:07,200
- I saw in the chat funnily enough that

1411
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:08,759
someone had to block porn and then they

1412
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,589
had to unblock it for business reasons

1413
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:13,170
I've actually been in that situation

1414
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:15,120
before - at a previous company because

1415
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:17,910
some of those studios were actually

1416
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:19,890
customers of ours but figuring out how

1417
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:22,710
do we block selectively how do we ensure

1418
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:24,089
that access to some of the sites were

1419
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:25,890
allowed so that if someone sends out

1420
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:28,800
information they can look up something

1421
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:30,810
accurate but stopping the people from

1422
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:33,570
blocking we had a valuable lesson in our

1423
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:35,370
own company someone kept trying often

1424
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:38,250
enough and when he stopped showing up in

1425
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:40,680
the logs our thought was not that he

1426
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:42,630
didn't do it anymore but that he found a

1427
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:44,160
workaround and that actually helped us

1428
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:47,040
improve our security by finding the

1429
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:48,359
bypass that he found so we're using a

1430
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,430
lot of these lessons and these

1431
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:52,200
relationships and what we're seeing to

1432
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:54,480
just kind of bolster the program and

1433
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:56,669
make sure that it's a cultural shift

1434
00:49:54,480 --> 00:50:01,790
we're making and it's not just something

1435
00:49:56,670 --> 00:50:04,140
we're trying to do in our own silo and

1436
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:06,060
with that we have a little bit of time

1437
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:09,779
if there are any questions please feel

1438
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:12,120
free to post into discord Wallach post

1439
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:14,010
we will answer but we do have a little

1440
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:16,589
fun game we want to play we've done this

1441
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:18,240
at our old presentation this gets a lot

1442
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:20,850
of great feedback just because it's

1443
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:25,529
engaging it gets the it gets everyone

1444
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:26,730
thinking and it's fun how do comments

1445
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:28,260
things it worked really well for you

1446
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:31,230
things you tried as far as getting

1447
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:35,250
security awareness more attention let us

1448
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:36,990
know if not we like to play a fun game

1449
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:39,690
we called who want to be a cybersecurity

1450
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:40,859
extraordinaire it's based very close

1451
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:43,320
then who wants to be a millionaire

1452
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:44,790
except that there's absolutely no money

1453
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:47,720
at the end of the day and you have to

1454
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:52,220
gets up with me instead of Regis Philbin

1455
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:52,220
with that let's get started

1456
00:50:53,230 --> 00:51:02,520
so users are and please enter these into

1457
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:12,849
the discord assets the enemy useless or

1458
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:19,900
security experts don't be shy people we

1459
00:51:12,849 --> 00:51:26,609
do that anyways but I did like the B and

1460
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:26,609
C over there and the answer is assets

1461
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:41,140
the percentage of Americans who know

1462
00:51:34,329 --> 00:51:50,500
what HTTPS means is a zero percent B 59%

1463
00:51:41,140 --> 00:52:01,078
C 30% or D 46% and we know everyone was

1464
00:51:50,500 --> 00:52:06,700
paying attention then the answer is C

1465
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:10,390
30% and the last extraordinary question

1466
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:11,770
also testing knowledge from earlier it's

1467
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:14,848
the percentage of Americans who

1468
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:20,440
understand what private browsing means

1469
00:52:14,849 --> 00:52:26,020
0% anyone who works in InfoSec 54% or

1470
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:34,380
24% lots of the lots of votes for 0 over

1471
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:34,380
there well the answer is 24%

1472
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:43,089
extraordinaires thanks for playing our

1473
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:45,520
game and then with that if anyone has

1474
00:52:43,089 --> 00:52:48,819
any questions comments things to share

1475

1482
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:07,880
my name is Megan's doing fine please

1483
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:09,560
reach out to us we'd love to talk about

1484
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:11,150
you know how we can build a better

1485
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:13,100
security team if you have suggestions

1486
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:15,710
for how we can improve I want to hear it

1487
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:17,180
you know if you have things that have

1488
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:19,850
worked for you awesome I want to hear

1489
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:21,290
those two things like that I think we

1490
00:53:19,850 --> 00:53:23,089
got a question do you work with your

1491
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:26,090
physical security team to develop any

1492
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:27,770
kind of overall security training um yes

1493
00:53:26,090 --> 00:53:30,170
and no and I'll let Aaron chime in on

1494
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:32,030
this as well so most of the time when we

1495
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:33,560
do physical security training it's for

1496
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:39,140
specific it's in response to specific

1497
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:40,820
things so for example we do work ovid we

1498
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:42,500
did a lot of joint work so we talked

1499
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:44,000
about both physical threats as well as

1500
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:45,800
the cyber threat you know hey let's talk

1501
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,300
about phishing emails let's talk about

1502
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:50,510
working from home and there are a lot

1503
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:53,180
more concerns we've also worked with

1504
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:54,890
them other things we work with the

1505
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:58,520
physical security team to develop sort

1506
00:53:54,890 --> 00:54:00,529
of country risk assessments we work in a

1507
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:03,890
number of countries around the world I

1508
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:07,310
think like 160 170 I could be off on

1509
00:54:03,890 --> 00:54:09,740
that but whenever we present whenever we

1510
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:11,270
create those or sort of presentations we

1511
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:12,830
talk about what the risk of that country

1512
00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:14,300
is we work with a physical security team

1513
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:15,650
so they'll talk about the physical risk

1514
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:17,480
you know the political and economic

1515
00:54:15,650 --> 00:54:19,430
culture and we'll add on you know

1516
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:21,590
whatever we have about cyber to add on

1517
00:54:19,430 --> 00:54:23,299
if there are any concerns specific to

1518
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:26,120
that country you know cybersecurity laws

1519
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:28,970
and to be aware of and there'll be other

1520
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:31,100
trainings we'll do joint work often when

1521
00:54:28,970 --> 00:54:32,480
its location related you know if we're

1522
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:33,890
seeing a lot of threats against an

1523
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:37,190
office when we're talking about smart

1524
00:54:33,890 --> 00:54:38,839
offices or smart devices or even just

1525
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:41,960
physical access to the office you know

1526
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:43,160
we all know that I can jump into your

1527
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:45,440
building and plug into your network

1528
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:49,009
directly it would use a lot of time for

1529
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:51,800
me so on this sort of those issues we

1530
00:54:49,010 --> 00:54:53,240
work very closely knit and we have

1531
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,350
regular conversations with them we've

1532
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:57,049
actually talked to them so they have

1533
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:58,549
like we have priority intelligence

1534
00:54:57,050 --> 00:55:00,260
requirements were basically the standing

1535
00:54:58,550 --> 00:55:02,300
requirements for the threat Intel team

1536
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:03,620
and we have some that come directly from

1537
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:06,020
the physical security team that we

1538
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:07,020
monitor for and continue having a

1539
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:09,690
conversation with

1540
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:11,430
about throughout the year or anything

1541
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:12,839
you have any specific things that spring

1542
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:14,940
to mind yes I think there were two

1543
00:55:12,839 --> 00:55:16,230
really important train not as their

1544
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:17,730
training that we've done but we've

1545
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:20,220
interacted very well with them when it

1546
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:22,470
came to as you mentioned tracking some

1547
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:24,060
unrest in your offices during the unite

1548
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:26,368
the right protests in Charlottesville

1549
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:27,900
sometime back we were providing pretty

1550
00:55:26,369 --> 00:55:28,950
much daily updates on what we're

1551
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:31,410
fighting through open source

1552
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:33,660
intelligence and other platforms because

1553
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:36,270
we do have a pretty major office there

1554
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:38,129
and anytime and that's an example but

1555
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:39,869
any other location where there are

1556
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:42,750
issues we do try to provide them

1557
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:44,910
information but one of the best track

1558
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:46,500
joint trainings that we've done and we

1559
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:48,330
actually had someone from the FBI come

1560
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:51,960
in as a speaker for one of them too was

1561
00:55:48,330 --> 00:55:54,869
around how to travel securely to hostile

1562
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:57,119
nation states we have business in a lot

1563
00:55:54,869 --> 00:55:59,040
of countries there are legitimate

1564
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:04,080
business travel reasons for people to go

1565
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:06,630
to Russia to China to Iran but we don't

1566
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:08,009
really trust a lot of the security

1567
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:10,890
measures that may be there so how do we

1568
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:13,170
travel securely how do we make sure from

1569
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:14,970
a physical standpoint as well as a cyber

1570
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:18,180
standpoint what do we need to be aware

1571
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:19,919
of and as a result of that training we

1572
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:22,770
ended up also creating a burner program

1573
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:25,080
that was in pilot phase and then once

1574
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:26,820
kovat 19 hit and all travel was

1575
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:28,950
suspended we haven't really had chance

1576
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:30,390
to use it that much but the burner

1577
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:33,839
program was a really excellent

1578
00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:35,700
collaboration between the teams on how

1579
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:37,560
do you determine who when someone needs

1580
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:39,990
a burner and what type of burner whether

1581
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:42,150
it's a device we can wipe or a device we

1582
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:44,310
need to just throw out afterwards so

1583
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:48,390
that was a really great training we both

1584
00:56:44,310 --> 00:56:50,310
have done travel in certain countries

1585
00:56:48,390 --> 00:56:52,200
that will do jointly with the physical

1586
00:56:50,310 --> 00:56:53,820
team so we'll talk both about you know

1587
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,859
any a lot of questions about what your

1588
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:57,660
devices at any point out of your control

1589
00:56:55,859 --> 00:56:59,580
and also a lot of their questions about

1590
00:56:57,660 --> 00:57:01,589
you know do you see anything unusual and

1591
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:03,660
we usually do those in concert a lot of

1592
00:57:01,589 --> 00:57:05,430
our physical security team is pretty

1593
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:09,690
practiced in doing deep in-depth

1594
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:11,520
interviews and interrogations and so

1595
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:15,500
we'll help work very closely with them

1596
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:15,500
for those kind of exercises as well

1597
00:57:15,950 --> 00:57:19,500
awesome and with that again as Megan

1598
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,760
said we'll be on Dischord the whole

1599
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:22,350
conference

1600
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:24,180
our Twitter handles are posted in there

1601
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:25,259
please feel free to reach out we're

1602
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:28,259
always happy to help

1603
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:35,970
we talk a lot we know happy to inflict

1604
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:37,710
that on others we actually we actually

1605
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:40,169
do we do do cybersecurity month we

1606
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:41,970
didn't talk a lot about that but we do a

1607
00:57:40,170 --> 00:57:44,480
couple things for cybersecurity month we

1608
00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:47,730
do an information campaign that goes out

1609
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:50,490
last year we did a sort of phishing

1610
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:52,260
campaign so we did six the increasingly

1611
00:57:50,490 --> 00:57:54,270
difficult phishing exercise that didn't

1612
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:57,150
count or a consequence management and we

1613
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:58,980
everyone who caught all six of them we

1614
00:57:57,150 --> 00:58:02,940
mailed them a security tumbler which I

1615
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:04,770
had one but they said zero clicks given

1616
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:06,960
I think it was very cheesy but we enter

1617
00:58:04,770 --> 00:58:08,700
we mailed out prizes to everyone if it

1618
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,620
does that then you know people keep the

1619
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:12,569
security tumbler like the coffee mug on

1620
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:15,000
their desk and then it sparks more of a

1621
00:58:12,570 --> 00:58:16,950
conversation and will do some other

1622
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,020
things we do we try to get leverage

1623
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:21,930
their security champions and that keeps

1624
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:23,970
to do events for their offices which we

1625
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:29,419
find really helpful as well I'm sort of

1626
00:58:23,970 --> 00:58:33,410
local events as much as we can awesome

1627
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:33,410
thank you thank you very much

1628
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:51,810
you
