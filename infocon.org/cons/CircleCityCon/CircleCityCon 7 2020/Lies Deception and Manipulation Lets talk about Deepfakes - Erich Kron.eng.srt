1
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:44,078
we're gonna talk a little bit today

2
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:46,269
about deep face I did put a link to a

3
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,909
video that I did just a quick kind of

4
00:00:46,269 --> 00:00:50,409
demo video in the track one on discord

5
00:00:48,909 --> 00:00:52,390
there if you want to check it out later

6
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:54,640
I will reference that later along with

7
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:57,519
another link that people tend to ask me

8
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,250
when I talk about this so we'll get into

9
00:00:57,519 --> 00:01:01,210
two things here in a minute a little bit

10
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:03,309
about myself

11
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:06,009
IT and security I've been doing this

12
00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:08,860
since scash in the 1990s is when I got

13
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:11,350
started ended up the security manager at

14
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:13,179
the second regional cyber center Western

15
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:15,729
Hemisphere for the US Army I was a

16
00:01:13,179 --> 00:01:17,470
contractor there for about ten years but

17
00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:19,899
I've worked in all kinds of different

18
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:22,270
areas I've worked in medical I've worked

19
00:01:19,899 --> 00:01:26,049
in large-scale manufacturing and

20
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:28,240
aerospace manufacturing place and if you

21
00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:30,250
have a CISSP I was the director of

22
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,170
member relations and services for IC

23
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,759
squared for a couple years and I used to

24
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:36,159
write questions for the CISSP

25
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:39,250
and the ISS AP so I might have caused

26
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,049
you some headaches fortunately here you

27
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:44,229
can't throw tomatoes at me so I'm pretty

28
00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:46,030
happy with that that being said I work

29
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:47,380
for know before we do a security

30
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:49,450
awareness training and simulated

31
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:51,670
phishing platform that's what we do

32
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:53,170
based out of Tampa here love it down

33
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:55,479
here whether it's kind of nice although

34
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:59,289
a little bit damp the last couple of

35
00:01:55,479 --> 00:02:01,539
days been raining pretty good but what

36
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:03,520
we do and why this matters is we get to

37
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:04,780
see a lot of the scams that are going on

38
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,420
a lot of the things that are happening

39
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,949
in the world and a lot of the trends

40
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:11,109
because we get to see a lot of like the

41
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:13,060
phishing emails and and that sort of

42
00:02:11,109 --> 00:02:14,620
thing and I talk to a lot of customers

43
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,950
that come on board after something bad

44
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:19,930
has happened and it's eye-opening to see

45
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:22,929
the kinds of things that are going on

46
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:25,390
out there it's it's pretty amazing so in

47
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,910
this talk this is what we're gonna do

48
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:29,738
this is kind of the agenda how how we

49
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:31,390
got started with this talk the

50
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:33,850
progression of digital fakes potential

51
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:34,119
impact detection and defending against

52
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,920
it

53
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,060
now if you have questions here's the

54
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,708
deal I'm not gonna be able to pop back

55
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,010
and forth into discord right now to be

56
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:43,540
able to do it but I will be at the track

57
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:45,220
afterwards so I'll be in track one for a

58
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,079
little bit afterwards to answer any

59
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,000
questions I know it can be a little bit

60
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,890
of a challenge jump in Windows so don't

61
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,370
worry about it too much if you do have a

62
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,349
quest

63
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:56,680
you know maybe you pop it in there and

64
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:59,260
I'll deal with it afterwards but anyways

65
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,970
that being said let's move on how did

66
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:04,000
this get started this is an interesting

67
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:06,340
talk for me and I'll tell you a little

68
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,069
bit about my background I used to be

69
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,989
very heavy into photography as a matter

70
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:12,579
of fact I still every once in a while

71
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:14,230
get like a royalty check for stock

72
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:16,810
photography that I have out there that's

73
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:20,018
for sale I've been very into digital

74
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:21,430
imaging and graphics it's something that

75
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:22,900
that actually got me started in

76
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:25,630
computers when I was in the Navy I was

77
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:28,780
on the USS America I was an avionics

78
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:31,000
tech to fix radar jammers and one of the

79
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:34,239
guys on the ship had this really cool

80
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,819
computer it was an Amiga 500 I believe

81
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,410
5,000 I remember but it was an Amiga I

82
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:41,018
remember that and he had this really

83
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:42,910
cool handheld scanner that you could

84
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:45,220
take pictures and if you've ever done

85
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:47,379
this man you know what I'm talking about

86
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:50,079
you click a button and then you roll

87
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:51,730
this scanner across the picture now it's

88
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:54,160
really easy to get it all messed up it's

89
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:56,500
not like the flatbeds we have today but

90
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,780
he'd fascinated me that we could now

91
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:02,940
take the photography aspect I was doing

92
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:05,950
with film digitize it and then modify it

93
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:07,269
it actually just blew my mind to see

94
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:09,339
this sort of thing so I got out of the

95
00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:11,769
Navy had to wait a few years because

96
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:15,459
this is back in the days folks when like

97
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:17,590
a 386 computer was starting around 3,000

98
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:20,048
bucks it was ridiculous back in these

99
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:22,299
days but I really got into the digital

100
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:24,400
thing well I've been following digital

101
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,810
imaging over the years and I've been

102
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,500
playing around with it in different ways

103
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:31,660
just as kind of a side hobby but one of

104
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:34,270
the things that the kind of drove this

105
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:37,570
is not only my love for that but I'm

106
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:39,430
good friends with Javad Malik and him

107
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:41,110
and I we go back and forth we love to

108
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:44,260
mess with each other all the time right

109
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:45,849
we play pranks on each other we we mess

110
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:47,710
with each other all the time well we've

111
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:49,630
been doing some stuff on whatsapp and we

112
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:51,130
were chatting and what we would do is we

113
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:53,380
would take something that somebody said

114
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:56,409
and we would you know basically just

115
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,969
copy it out and rearrange it digitally

116
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:59,979
and put it back in and go man I can't

117
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:02,020
believe you said this you know and we

118
00:04:59,979 --> 00:05:04,960
started just twisting what we were

119
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:07,599
saying we started making it look

120
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,698
like we were saying really really bad

121
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,949
things to each other so at some point in

122
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:14,590
time we we kind of reach that point a

123
00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:16,990
mutually assured destruction with the HR

124
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:19,388
group right like if this ever went to HR

125
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:21,099
we'd both be exploded because you know

126
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:22,030
it's stuff we didn't say but it would be

127
00:05:21,099 --> 00:05:24,159
pretty good and we started thinking

128
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:26,049
about that we started going man this

129
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,729
could really be used against people and

130
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:30,520
then we started talking about how

131
00:05:27,729 --> 00:05:33,039
imaging works and and you know he does a

132
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:35,080
lot of videos I do more with photography

133
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,330
but we started talking about how easy it

134
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:40,780
is to tweak this and mess with this well

135
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:42,580
I had already been dabbling a little bit

136
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:44,530
in deep fake stuff and so I was like man

137
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:46,508
let's let's see what we got here you

138
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,849
know and so I started playing with it a

139
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:52,599
little bit and I found that it was

140
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:54,759
amazingly easy to do things with deep

141
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:56,259
fake technology and then you know

142
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:58,690
thinking about the ways that it could be

143
00:05:56,259 --> 00:06:00,699
used against us was just kind of ugly so

144
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:03,159
that's kind of where this started so I'm

145
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:05,169
gonna I'm gonna go into kind of the

146
00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:06,460
progression of digital face so we're

147
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:07,568
gonna start kind of at the beginning I'm

148
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:10,359
gonna show you some different ways that

149
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:13,270
this can happen not all fakes are bad

150
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,310
but a lot of them can be used for

151
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:17,830
malicious purposes if you really want

152
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:20,169
them to so I'm gonna start with Javad

153
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:22,570
start because he's a smart guy he was a

154
00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:25,299
researcher with 451 for a while and he's

155
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:27,580
great at putting together quad charts in

156
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:29,590
the left side is a static stuff right

157
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:31,449
the photos and the top is the shallow

158
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:34,448
now the way we differentiated this too

159
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:38,289
too deep is really kind of applying the

160
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:39,729
AI portion to it so in the top left you

161
00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:41,889
know you have the text manipulation like

162
00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:43,508
what we were doing you got the photo

163
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:45,490
editing or adding filters and

164
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:48,159
photoshopping in the middle over there

165
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:49,990
as you get more dynamic is the green

166
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:52,030
screen stuff you know we're all becoming

167
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:53,979
pros with green screen and zoom right

168
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:55,539
all of our digital meetings have at

169
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:57,310
least in the beginning everyone was

170
00:06:55,539 --> 00:06:59,500
putting wacky stuff up behind them I

171
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:01,960
think we hopefully have bored of that a

172
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:04,570
little bit but then you got the JibJab

173
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,580
style and then on to full CGI now

174
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:11,050
getting down into the AI stuff you have

175
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:13,000
vide clothing the Face Swap the people

176
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:15,729
that don't even exist on the really deep

177
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,670
static part how many of you seen those a

178
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:20,680
I created photos of people

179
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:23,320
that they really don't even exist it was

180
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,690
AI that put it together and some of

181
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:28,920
those some of those are really really

182
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:30,700
bad like it's nightmarish type stuff but

183
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:33,190
there's some in there that are just

184
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,960
amazing and it's not even a person but

185
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:36,969
the AI put that together pretty cool

186
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,609
stuff then you get the face swaps over

187
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:40,990
there and then full-on puppetry right so

188
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:42,730
this is kind of the dynamic the

189
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:44,830
important thing to remember is you know

190
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:48,700
we're kind of drawing the line when you

191
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:50,169
get into the AI part of it and that's

192
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,450
that's the difference between the deep

193
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:54,880
and shallow stuff so simple image

194
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:57,280
manipulation there's things you can do

195
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,659
removing people from busy locations I'll

196
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,570
show you that tilt shift force

197
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:04,720
perspective and remember that you know

198
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:08,349
we can use just simple images to modify

199
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,360
screenshots as well as photos so again

200
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:13,210
you can screenshot something and say

201
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,400
this is what that person said take it to

202
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:17,169
HR and that person probably doesn't have

203
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,450
a screenshot of what they actually said

204
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:21,280
right and so the the information is

205
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:22,360
stacked against you it's one way that

206
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,599
this can be leveraged

207
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,490
now image stacking is really cool when I

208
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,740
first got started in digital imaging

209
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:31,660
there were ways to do this but it was

210
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,400
very manual and essentially what you do

211
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:38,380
is you go to a location that's very busy

212
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:40,630
right and you set up a like a tripod

213
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:43,330
there and you just start taking pictures

214
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:45,460
over time and what happens is people

215
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:47,920
move around in the frame so eventually

216
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:50,800
what you have is all of the digital

217
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,540
information when the people have moved

218
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,400
out of the way like say it's blocked one

219
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:56,170
moment and then as they move away it's

220
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,449
there in the next but they block another

221
00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:00,160
piece right well image stacking is where

222
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:03,550
you take a whole mess of those photos

223
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,949
and then you essentially remove those

224
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:08,620
portions by replacing it with the image

225
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:10,030
data that was in the other photos if

226
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:13,120
that makes sense I hope that makes sense

227
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:16,420
to you but by doing that you can remove

228
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,700
people from frames you can remove all of

229
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:20,860
the people from frames and if you look

230
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:23,680
at this and the left and the right you

231
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:25,930
even remove shadows you even remove you

232
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:29,530
know whatever you want to remove you can

233
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:30,670
do through this method now again used to

234
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:32,010
have to do this was a very manual

235
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,750
process now it

236
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:35,580
just a script that comes with Photoshop

237
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,450
which blows in my mind you just boom and

238
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,700
it's done right

239
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:40,290
this is how mainstream it's kind of got

240
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,270
in there but if you're ever you know

241
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:44,280
touristy you want to go to DC or

242
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:46,680
something I can tell you you will almost

243
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:48,959
never see like the the Lincoln Memorial

244
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,729
without a mass of people in front of it

245
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,740
but if you take your time and you wait

246
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:54,750
long enough you can piece together a

247
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:57,390
photo like this this is how we see a lot

248
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:59,640
of those photos that don't have people

249
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:01,710
in front of them just a subtle

250
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,810
manipulation sort of thing now

251
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:06,600
tilt-shift images this kind is is an

252
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:09,839
interesting thing for me this takes real

253
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:12,260
photos and makes them look fake it's

254
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:15,330
actually a really simple technique and

255
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:19,140
it definitely works with like drone

256
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:21,480
shots and so this is a real town this is

257
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:23,670
a real photo so there's nobody on the

258
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,650
streets that I can see here maybe they

259
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:26,849
did some stuff and you know took a

260
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,829
couple of shots I don't know our

261
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:30,660
Photoshop people out but essentially

262
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:33,210
what you do here is is from above

263
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:35,040
usually at about a 45 degree angle you

264
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:36,900
apply a blur filter on the top and the

265
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,699
bottom and stripes if you look at it you

266
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:41,340
can see how that's blurred and then you

267
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:44,250
crank up the saturation this makes real

268
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:47,160
things look unreal which is always kind

269
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:49,890
of an interesting thing you know real

270
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:52,230
world application to to mess with people

271
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:54,930
on this I don't know but it is

272
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:59,100
definitely a beat what's becoming a more

273
00:10:54,930 --> 00:11:02,280
popular type of image manipulation from

274
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:04,710
drone footage now this one we've all

275
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,300
seen forced perspective right you got

276
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:08,790
the guy with the big cup you know the

277
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:11,130
you know the bucket fallin over them

278
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:13,969
there and of course the super mega mult

279
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:18,390
multi sized dog they're running at you

280
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:21,660
this is a this is one of those tricks

281
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:24,060
with photography where depending on how

282
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:27,180
close or far something is from the lens

283
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:29,819
you can make a big difference okay zoom

284
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:31,949
lenses can make it can compress the

285
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:34,860
depth of field and make things look much

286
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:38,460
much closer now where we do see this in

287
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:41,220
real world stuff is I've seen some

288
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:42,930
photos that were done around Cova 19

289
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:46,170
where they were talking about people

290
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:49,170
social distancing and in some of the

291
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:50,250
they were taken kinda head head on with

292
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:52,020
a bunch of people and it looked like

293
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,460
they were packed together but from some

294
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:55,829
of the other angles he could see that

295
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:57,570
people are actually separated apart it

296
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:59,250
just depends on what story the

297
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:01,320
photographer wanted to tell with those

298
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:03,510
pictures and that's an important thing

299
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,520
to remember when it comes to photos

300
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:09,360
whether it's in the news whether it's

301
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:12,600
whatever generally speaking a photo is

302
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:15,390
meant to tell a story what that story is

303
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:18,150
can be messed with a little bit now

304
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:20,939
these forced perspective ones um I'm on

305
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:23,280
a forum here in Florida because well we

306
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:25,440
have snakes we have a lot of snakes and

307
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:28,439
so people post up pictures of snakes a

308
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,240
lot and what they'll do is you know they

309
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,490
take a stick or something like that and

310
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,960
they have it way out in front of them

311
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:36,150
towards the camera lens while they're

312
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:38,480
standing there and it makes the the

313
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:40,949
snake or the alligator or the whatever

314
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,260
look much much larger kind of like the

315
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:45,360
dog in the right hand picture here we've

316
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:48,210
seen that with the camel spiders in some

317
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,520
of the earlier shots to the the point to

318
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:53,850
this is it's an easy thing to fake that

319
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:56,610
actually takes no digital workmanship

320
00:12:53,850 --> 00:13:00,950
but essentially setting up the shot and

321
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:04,080
the the equipment in a certain way now

322
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:07,020
we've all seen the the filters right the

323
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:09,300
face swap apps adding cat ears in real

324
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,740
time how many of you remember this one

325
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,780
aging you by twenty or thirty years

326
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,490
right there was all the hubbub about oh

327
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:17,880
we're sending all our information to the

328
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:21,030
Russians you know but if you looked at

329
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:23,939
that it was remarkably good remarkably

330
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:26,069
good now many of this many of the times

331
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:28,560
this stuff is being done locally on our

332
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:30,090
cell phones which says a couple things

333
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,189
first of all we got a lot more power in

334
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:34,950
our hands and we you know often realized

335
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:37,500
or think about this from a guy that

336
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:40,050
played the snake game on a Nokia back in

337
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:42,420
in my younger years but we got a lot of

338
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:45,030
horse power on our phones to be able to

339
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:47,219
do some of this augmented reality stuff

340
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:49,260
we have the face swapping apps right

341
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:51,330
these are like real-time ish and no

342
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:53,280
they're not perfect but you know

343
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:55,110
Instagram and and those you know

344
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,610
Facebook has these these filters where

345
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:59,820
you can do that and then there's the

346
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:02,580
making animals talk one as well which

347
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:05,820
is pretty interesting to see that sort

348
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:08,190
of thing happen but as these filters are

349
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:10,980
getting better we're being able to make

350
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:13,980
more realistic looking stuff like that a

351
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:16,550
[ __ ] I'll tell you right now that when

352
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:19,770
this happened this was a Pakistani

353
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:21,359
ministers live presentation nobody

354
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:26,699
believed those were his real cat ears

355
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:29,220
okay not like the the other the aging

356
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:32,040
app it didn't look that real but it is

357
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:34,740
kind of funny that here we got a guy

358
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:38,040
who's doing a live broadcasting a

359
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:40,080
minister in Pakistan and the person

360
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:42,540
forgot to take the cat air filters off

361
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:44,310
before they were live-streaming it now

362
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:46,199
it was kind of it was funny if you watch

363
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:48,630
the video it's like moving the cat ears

364
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,550
to different people on the panel not

365
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:51,900
everybody would roll with this and think

366
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:54,089
it's pretty funny but if you think about

367
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:56,010
it it is a pretty powerful technology to

368
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:58,140
have in our phone if there's some

369
00:14:56,010 --> 00:15:00,660
pokemons go people here you know the

370
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:03,630
augmented reality there I'll be honest I

371
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:06,959
barely saw that one but then that's some

372
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:08,490
cool stuff now talking pets where this

373
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,230
starts getting into some some more

374
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,940
advanced stuff this is where we start

375
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:13,710
getting a little bit more advanced you

376
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:16,950
can take a picture of your pet and you

377
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:19,320
can make it talk very cool right well

378
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:21,600
what it does is it's more than just the

379
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,400
mouth moving this actually takes and

380
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,490
starts making me making movements around

381
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:28,740
the eyebrows and the eyes and different

382
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:30,480
places to better emulate that there's a

383
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:32,070
video there at that YouTube thing if you

384
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,570
want to go check it out

385
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:37,440
but it's pretty interesting so we're

386
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:40,560
getting into more realistic stuff just

387
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,600
with the talking pet stuff here and it's

388
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,060
it's pretty fascinating a lot of this

389
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,790
stuff is free or very low charge you

390
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:48,959
know for for this tech it's not new it's

391
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:52,140
been around for a while but we're

392
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:54,930
improving on it constantly and so that

393
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:58,350
brings me now to the video deep fake

394
00:15:54,930 --> 00:16:00,000
apps there's a few of them out there

395
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:01,970
the vast majority of these things are

396
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,200
free they're downloadable from github

397
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:06,270
that's where the ones that I've been

398
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:09,060
playing with were is right from github

399
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:11,610
now they're gonna use a GPU to make

400
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:13,910
things reasonably quick if you try to

401
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:15,290
put it on a CPU even

402
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:18,189
I found a thread ripper or something

403
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:20,719
your machine is just going to cry

404
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:23,540
there's an option to do that in some of

405
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:26,210
these but man it's just not worth it

406
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:30,319
most of the time these are using NVIDIA

407
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:32,840
GPUs and CUDA cores to do this a lot of

408
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:36,860
these run on like tensorflow

409
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:38,900
as the AI back-end but they're using GPU

410
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:41,510
to do a lot of different things in here

411
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:43,010
including the AI piece now on these

412
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:44,750
video deep fake apps what you're gonna

413
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:47,380
do is you're gonna take a movie or a

414
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:51,290
video now videos as we know are

415
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:53,540
essentially 29.97 frames per second or

416
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:54,890
30 frames per second and it's gonna take

417
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:57,170
that video and it's gonna break it out

418
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:59,390
into individual frames and then from

419
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:01,130
each individual frame it's gonna go

420
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:05,060
through and it's gonna select the face

421
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:06,589
around the people or or of the people

422
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:08,720
that are in that frame

423
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:09,919
it gets pretty ugly pretty fast actually

424
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,810
when you do this and you're having to

425
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,660
sort through the videos you'll see an

426
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:16,369
example of that here in just a second

427
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:18,590
but it basically breaks that down

428
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:20,780
throughout all of these different frames

429
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:24,319
and pulls those faces out it's usually a

430
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:26,420
128 by 128 pixels square that it uses

431
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:29,389
and it uses you know facial recognition

432
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:31,790
to be able to pull that stuff apart the

433
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:32,960
thing with video deep fake apps is at

434
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:36,020
least though all the ones that I've

435
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,390
worked is right now they do not modify

436
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:41,600
the audio so if you're going to be

437
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:43,580
changing things you either need to have

438
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,219
a voiceover actor if you want to make it

439
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:48,949
realistic or some other sort of audio

440
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:51,080
that you're trying to put in there to to

441
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:53,870
make it sound like that otherwise you

442
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:55,879
will have whoever originally did the

443
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:58,550
video their voice with a different face

444
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:00,980
so that is you know that's the one thing

445
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:02,720
now there is some there's some stuff

446
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,790
being worked on with that too where if

447
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,260
we combine this maybe maybe it'll be

448
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:08,210
different and I'll talk about that just

449
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:09,950
here in a second now one of the ones

450
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:11,690
I've used the most is called deep face

451
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:14,390
lab and this is where you get it from

452
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:17,210
it's on github here Windows binaries are

453
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:21,920
downloadable I believe there's a version

454
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:23,500
that will run on AMD cards here it it

455
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:27,230
didn't seem to make much of a difference

456
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:28,039
now I actually used my laptop which is a

457
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:30,979
gaming laptop

458
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:32,389
it has I think an Nvidia 1080 in it so

459
00:18:30,979 --> 00:18:34,070
it's a pretty beefy video card for a

460
00:18:32,389 --> 00:18:36,949
laptop and it did pretty well I've also

461
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:40,090
used my desktop which uses AMD and it

462
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:42,769
did ok as well too none of this stuff is

463
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:46,100
super fast that's something you've got

464
00:18:42,769 --> 00:18:49,369
to think about I put a link like I said

465
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:52,570
in the track one on discord there to a

466
00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:55,879
deep fake video that I did side by side

467
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:59,059
with Justin Ong from Spiceworks

468
00:18:55,879 --> 00:19:02,748
and I basically took him and I put a

469
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:04,340
Elon Musk's face on him and I did it

470
00:19:02,749 --> 00:19:05,899
split-screen because honestly when you

471
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:08,269
look at them one at a time

472
00:19:05,899 --> 00:19:09,889
it's kind of hard to tell but by putting

473
00:19:08,269 --> 00:19:11,690
them side-by-side you see the

474
00:19:09,889 --> 00:19:14,149
differences and there are some glitches

475
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:16,099
in that there's a few like you know

476
00:19:14,149 --> 00:19:18,080
there's some moments definitely in that

477
00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:20,678
it's not perfect but what's important to

478
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:24,199
know on that video is I did that using

479
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:26,269
absolute defaults I did not tweak things

480
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,849
in any way shape or form within you know

481
00:19:26,269 --> 00:19:31,369
the settings on there it was default

482
00:19:28,849 --> 00:19:32,749
settings and I did that section of video

483
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:34,369
I think I ended up doing you know a

484
00:19:32,749 --> 00:19:36,019
couple of minutes worth total I don't

485
00:19:34,369 --> 00:19:37,428
think it's all up there because it you

486
00:19:36,019 --> 00:19:40,460
know just kind of runs together but I

487
00:19:37,429 --> 00:19:42,799
did a couple of minutes total it took me

488
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:45,169
about one day to do it I think it was

489
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:48,049
about eight hours of AI training 8 to 12

490
00:19:45,169 --> 00:19:51,409
hours of AI training and then you know

491
00:19:48,049 --> 00:19:53,539
the sorting of stuff it was very very

492
00:19:51,409 --> 00:19:55,340
interesting how this works you know when

493
00:19:53,539 --> 00:19:59,690
when you look at this and it was amazing

494
00:19:55,340 --> 00:20:02,029
how easily it made things work now it's

495
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:04,509
important what I found is when you're

496
00:20:02,029 --> 00:20:07,489
doing this you need to make sure that

497
00:20:04,509 --> 00:20:10,669
the both faces that you're gonna use

498
00:20:07,489 --> 00:20:12,440
have similar structures I found that you

499
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:15,859
know putting an arrow face on a wide

500
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:18,859
face just don't work so well mustaches

501
00:20:15,859 --> 00:20:20,899
beards stuff like this can definitely be

502
00:20:18,859 --> 00:20:23,059
an issue with that as well so it's not

503
00:20:20,899 --> 00:20:25,039
perfect by any means but it's pretty

504
00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:27,678
stinkin good for free and what you can

505
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:29,809
do pretty quick now it extracts these

506
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,509
frames and what it basically does is he

507
00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:35,149
uses AI now to build a model between the

508
00:20:32,509 --> 00:20:37,759
two okay so you're doing frames from the

509
00:20:35,149 --> 00:20:40,219
source and frames from the destination

510
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:41,990
and it basically builds a model by

511
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:44,360
pairing those two things together

512
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:46,100
blending them and what happens is you

513
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:49,850
end up with a video that includes eye

514
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:52,699
blinks and other different facial sorta

515
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:55,490
tics which is really fascinating and

516
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:57,679
lends to the realism of it now we all

517
00:20:55,490 --> 00:21:00,350
know that well at least a lot of us know

518
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:04,130
that a lot of this deep fake video stuff

519
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:08,240
actually came from putting celebrities

520
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:10,790
faces on pornographic type videos on

521
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,640
adult videos that was a big deal got a

522
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:16,970
group or two banned from reddit over it

523
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:18,710
that's how this kind of started and of

524
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:20,600
course can be used for that sort of

525
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:22,460
thing as well in the future we'll talk

526
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,139
about some of the threats with it now

527
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,790
when I'm talking about the output you

528
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:29,210
can see here this was what I was doing

529
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:31,100
with a couple folks from the lost all

530
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:32,660
the money video I love that be if you

531
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:35,570
haven't seen it look it up its host

532
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:38,120
unknowns lost all the money but this is

533
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:39,409
Javad and Tom and this is what you end

534
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,909
up with you end up with a whole bunch of

535
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:42,320
stuff here now you have to go through

536
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:44,270
and you have to filter out the stuff you

537
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:47,450
don't want and just keep the faces that

538
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:49,070
you do want in here and it can be pretty

539
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:52,090
brutal so if you're gonna play with this

540
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:54,950
do some short clips first take a video

541
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:57,320
knock it down to you know a minute and a

542
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:59,120
half or a minute and practice on that

543
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:02,090
rather than going full-length stuff

544
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:04,100
because this is probably the worst part

545
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:07,159
of making deep fakes is pulling this

546
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:09,919
stuff apart like this and isolating

547
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:11,330
those images this is what the AI uses to

548
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,740
Train off of and you can see those

549
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:16,040
square pixels I was talking about for

550
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:20,090
the faces now moving on to the audio

551
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:22,190
deep fake apps also from github also

552
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:26,750
uses the GPU to make things very very

553
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:29,090
fast the it uses the AI to replace or

554
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:31,880
create the voice using audio clips that

555
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:34,220
you can get you know things from from

556
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:36,770
videos from talks from stuff like that

557
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:39,200
to create the voice it uses that to

558
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:41,600
train so one of the ones that I've been

559
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,550
playing with a little bit more and I'm

560
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,490
seeing a lot of activity on is this real

561
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:49,399
time voice cloning this one right here

562
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:50,929
is it's also downloadable from github

563
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:54,110
there's a link right there

564
00:22:50,929 --> 00:22:55,850
it's a Python based tool it generates

565
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:58,879
arbitrary speech and

566
00:22:55,850 --> 00:23:02,059
real-time or near real-time uses some

567
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,789
pre-trained models it's not great not

568
00:23:02,059 --> 00:23:07,129
gonna lie you can definitely hear that

569
00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:10,789
it's a digitized voice but it is

570
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:12,950
improving very very quickly on this

571
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:16,100
particular repository and not a day goes

572
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:17,960
by that I'm not getting notifications of

573
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:21,260
people posting up stuff trying this

574
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:24,020
trying that there's a lot of activity in

575
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:26,900
this place right now and I think that

576
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:30,370
this is this is something we're gonna

577
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:32,750
see a lot more of moving forward and

578
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:35,360
we'll talk about kind of the impact of

579
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:38,240
this and and how this can be a problem

580
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:42,379
here in just a moment so let's move into

581
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:44,240
that first of all wouldn't be a cyber

582
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,799
conference if there wasn't a Sun Zoo

583
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,620
slide so I did that for the obligatory

584
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:52,429
Sun zoo all warfare is based on

585
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:54,350
deception yes yes it is and and the

586
00:23:52,429 --> 00:23:56,090
warfare thing is pretty strong here I

587
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:58,699
get that right some people have an issue

588
00:23:56,090 --> 00:24:00,439
with that but here's the deal especially

589
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:03,860
in the industry that I'm in which is

590
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:06,860
phishing and social engineering this

591
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:09,620
stuff is being done a lot by very

592
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:12,559
organized groups there are groups doing

593
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:14,870
this there are nation-states yes there

594
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:16,940
nation states there are organized crime

595
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:19,250
gangs that are involved in all this

596
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:21,740
social engineering stuff this is not a

597
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:23,179
bunch of just individuals you know in

598
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,320
the basement drinking Mountain Dew and

599
00:24:23,179 --> 00:24:27,169
eating pizza

600
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:29,899
these folks are pretty serious and what

601
00:24:27,169 --> 00:24:31,490
they're doing in these attacks that are

602
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:33,320
related to you know business email

603
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:36,250
compromised and things like that is

604
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:39,129
oftentimes warfare you know we've seen

605
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:42,470
terrorist organizations funding their

606
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:44,299
activities through Dec sort of attacks

607
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:46,340
and money taken through social

608
00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:48,650
engineering attacks so yeah it is pretty

609
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:49,939
serious but I did have to put this in

610
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:51,710
there just you know to make sure we

611
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:53,809
check that box if you're playing like

612
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:55,610
con bingo or something you can check

613
00:24:53,809 --> 00:24:59,270
that one off now

614
00:24:55,610 --> 00:25:01,490
so again when it comes to business email

615
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:03,650
compromised man this is a ridiculous

616
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:07,190
sort of attack that's going on basically

617
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:08,900
you know the CEO sends an email and says

618
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:09,159
wire off a bunch of money and the person

619
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,349
on the

620
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:14,259
does that they do that because they're

621
00:25:11,349 --> 00:25:15,879
convinced it's the CEO that's why they

622
00:25:14,259 --> 00:25:17,739
do this sort of thing that's why they go

623
00:25:15,879 --> 00:25:20,649
out and they buy a bunch of gift cards

624
00:25:17,739 --> 00:25:23,799
and send the bad guys the the gift card

625
00:25:20,649 --> 00:25:25,899
information right so this is where this

626
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:28,570
kind of technology I think is going to

627
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:31,149
be definitely leveraged these are

628
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:33,789
deception attacks this is all about

629
00:25:31,149 --> 00:25:36,340
deceiving people and convincing them of

630
00:25:33,789 --> 00:25:39,158
some other reality so when I talk about

631
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:41,859
reality and the root of deception

632
00:25:39,159 --> 00:25:43,809
I do tall talks on this piece because

633
00:25:41,859 --> 00:25:47,189
it's fascinating to me our psychological

634
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:49,599
aspects and how we work and do things

635
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:52,299
from a psychological level and how our

636
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:54,639
minds work but our brains job is to

637
00:25:52,299 --> 00:25:57,609
filter interpret and present reality and

638
00:25:54,639 --> 00:26:00,008
I want to touch on that because we have

639
00:25:57,609 --> 00:26:03,220
to understand we always assume that what

640
00:26:00,009 --> 00:26:05,519
we taste what we smell what we hear what

641
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:08,379
we see that all of that is actually

642
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:10,299
reality and I will tell you this our

643
00:26:08,379 --> 00:26:13,859
brains do an amazing job of filtering

644
00:26:10,299 --> 00:26:17,830
things they do filter a lot of stuff out

645
00:26:13,859 --> 00:26:19,658
for example just just you know if you

646
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:22,059
look side to side right now with your

647
00:26:19,659 --> 00:26:23,559
eyes do you see your nose well the

648
00:26:22,059 --> 00:26:25,749
answer is probably not until you think

649
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:28,479
about it right why because your brain

650
00:26:25,749 --> 00:26:30,070
actually filters that out of your field

651
00:26:28,479 --> 00:26:32,139
of vision automatically we're not

652
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:34,928
thinking about it these sorts of things

653
00:26:32,139 --> 00:26:36,849
are what's going on all the time look at

654
00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:38,080
some of these interesting things that

655
00:26:36,849 --> 00:26:40,599
have gone on over the years you know

656
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,699
what color is the dress you got to

657
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:44,408
people say monitor same lighting

658
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:46,239
conditions there are some physical

659
00:26:44,409 --> 00:26:48,279
things that can you know that that

660
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:50,679
influence this but they see the same

661
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:52,840
dress in two different colors now once

662
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:54,820
you've seen the dress in that color it's

663
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:57,220
really really hard to try to see it in

664
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:59,499
any other color even if you've seen the

665
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:01,239
you know the enhancements that bring

666
00:26:59,499 --> 00:27:04,090
that out so that everybody can see it

667
00:27:01,239 --> 00:27:06,009
it's very very hard to see that or how

668
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:10,509
many of you remember hmm I'm totally

669
00:27:06,009 --> 00:27:13,779
gonna to age myself here but those what

670
00:27:10,509 --> 00:27:16,599
are they called stereo strop ik I think

671
00:27:13,779 --> 00:27:20,919
stereoscopic posters basically it's the

672
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:22,939
random in like shapes on a poster and if

673
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:25,610
you cross your eyes just right and you

674
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:28,400
and on one foot like a whale pops out of

675
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:30,290
this thing like a 3d whale right really

676
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:33,770
crazy pictures I've never been real good

677
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:35,750
at seeing them myself but I have caught

678
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:37,970
a couple and once you see that thing

679
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:40,700
once you see that popping out it's

680
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:42,680
really really hard to unsee it that's

681
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:44,870
because our brain has now picked that

682
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:48,020
out and it filters it when we see it it

683
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:51,350
is important to know that our filters

684
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:53,060
can be exploited there's all kinds of

685
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:54,800
things that happen with our brain so we

686
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:56,600
have to understand that and if you want

687
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:59,060
to learn some stuff about brains man

688
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,590
there is a series called brain games out

689
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:02,090
there and I want to say it's on Hulu or

690
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:04,060
something right now that is some

691
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:06,800
mind-blowing stuff that they do to show

692
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:09,110
just how much of our reality is actually

693
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:12,169
filtered information from our brains

694
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:15,860
being basically fed to our cognizant

695
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:17,570
self fantastic show to watch so when it

696
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:20,479
comes to video or photo fakes you know

697
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:22,610
what can these be used for what is the

698
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,750
attacks that can be done well romance

699
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:26,780
scams if you've ever known anyone

700
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:28,580
dealing with a romance scam these are

701
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:30,740
bad right and so what do you do you tell

702
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:32,570
somebody we'll have them you know drink

703
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:34,040
a cup of tea with their pinky up okay

704
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:37,970
and have them send you a picture that

705
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:39,470
way you know it's them well with with

706
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:41,600
some of this deep fake stuff you could

707
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:43,310
probably even fake some of that now the

708
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,040
trick is a lot of romance scams they

709
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:50,720
will use a photo of somebody who's

710
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:53,240
either famous or you know doing well in

711
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,700
one way or another as the you know the

712
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:58,460
the basis of the romance scam or it'll

713
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:59,990
be a celebrity like oh you know the the

714
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:01,460
grandparents are going oh Yanni has a

715
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:04,850
sudden interest in me you know or

716
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:06,680
whatever and so by doing this though

717
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:08,480
they could actually fake those sorts of

718
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:10,430
things this is like the the proof of

719
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,960
life things when you have a ransom

720
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:14,000
incident of physical ransom incident

721
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,960
proof of life you could actually fake

722
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,530
those sorts of things

723
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:21,020
what about outrage clickbait okay so

724
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:22,879
what about clickbait what about putting

725
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:25,790
up ads that show somebody doing

726
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:28,070
something that is absolutely absurd and

727
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:30,680
then saying you know come both this this

728
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:32,990
joker out or or do whatever come sign

729
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:34,310
this petition and then of course when

730
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:35,900
you go to sign the petition they have to

731
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:37,669
make sure you're a legitimate person

732
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:39,320
right and so they're gonna ask you for

733
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:41,420
your name your address your social

734
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:43,250
security number the name of your first

735
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:45,320
pet your mother's maiden name right you

736
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:47,240
get the idea right so they can use that

737
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:50,050
to get people to click on things to

738
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:52,580
gather information and the last one -

739
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:55,430
not last by any means but you know the

740
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:57,199
bullet on here election influencing you

741
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:58,640
may or may not realize this we have an

742
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,900
election coming up here in the US and

743
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:05,690
it's gonna be a hell of an election

744
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:08,480
imagine if one side or the other or both

745
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:10,490
sides start dropping some of these

746
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:14,300
things right near the election that's so

747
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:15,920
absurd like you know this or that and I

748
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,840
don't even want to go into details here

749
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:20,660
but you can imagine some of the things

750
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,399
that can be made up this goes out it

751
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:24,050
gets spread through everybody everybody

752
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:26,810
goes oh my gosh and then they go throw

753
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:28,460
their votes and then it's disproved you

754
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:29,169
know hard disproved by then the damage

755
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:32,780
is already done

756
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:35,660
that's what I worry about what's coming

757
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:37,670
up with respect to that now just to give

758
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:39,230
you an idea how some of these things can

759
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:42,520
be kind of weaponized against somebody

760
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:45,260
here is one of the British royalty and

761
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:47,990
that's probably not a very royal thing

762
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:49,460
to be doing right imagine the headlines

763
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:51,830
that kind of go along with something

764
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:55,790
like this well if you actually look at

765
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:58,610
it this is what he's doing okay

766
00:30:55,790 --> 00:31:00,080
but you can see how that can be

767
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:02,479
weaponized he's counting to three

768
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:04,189
apparently he needs his fingers there to

769
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,200
do that but he's counting to three

770
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:09,170
apparently and but you can see how from

771
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:12,800
the other angle this can be construed as

772
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:16,180
something very very different and this

773
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:19,639
could have long-lasting effects honestly

774
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:21,620
also you might have noticed there's been

775
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:23,270
a little bit of tension going on in the

776
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:26,000
world these last couple of months right

777
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:28,550
we got a pandemic we've got riots we've

778
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,620
got protests peaceful protests we got

779
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:32,540
all kinds of stuff going on it's madness

780
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:34,939
I mean we really are kind of in the

781
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:38,270
apocalypse right now it feels like but

782
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:41,390
using social media platforms to take

783
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:43,580
these fakes and amplify them are is

784
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:46,040
something that is absolutely going to be

785
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:47,740
happening no doubt about it

786
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:49,639
we know that the bad actors and

787
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:51,649
nation-states especially

788
00:31:49,639 --> 00:31:54,728
are playing games out there already in

789
00:31:51,649 --> 00:31:56,958
social media as a way to divide people

790
00:31:54,729 --> 00:31:58,429
you know you see here on one of the

791
00:31:56,959 --> 00:32:01,429
studies more than half of the social

792
00:31:58,429 --> 00:32:04,700
media posts about George Floyd were from

793
00:32:01,429 --> 00:32:07,039
fake accounts being troll and/or bought

794
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:09,139
accounts and then the one on the right

795
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:12,049
about Cova de coronavirus this was done

796
00:32:09,139 --> 00:32:13,789
by Carnegie Mellon they found that

797
00:32:12,049 --> 00:32:16,009
almost half of the accounts tweeting

798
00:32:13,789 --> 00:32:18,679
about it were BOTS or had bought like

799
00:32:16,009 --> 00:32:20,929
activities okay that's pretty

800
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:22,669
significant and what happens here is

801
00:32:20,929 --> 00:32:25,279
people see something that aligns with

802
00:32:22,669 --> 00:32:27,079
their beliefs and they amplify that

803
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:30,049
message but they're being blown out by

804
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:32,418
these by these BOTS now in a curious

805
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:34,849
thing in some of these cases the same

806
00:32:32,419 --> 00:32:38,479
bots were actually seen spreading

807
00:32:34,849 --> 00:32:40,489
information on both sides and what they

808
00:32:38,479 --> 00:32:43,190
found in I believe it was the the

809
00:32:40,489 --> 00:32:44,809
coronavirus one there on the right in

810
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:47,289
one of these two studies they were

811
00:32:44,809 --> 00:32:50,959
talking about how this essentially

812
00:32:47,289 --> 00:32:53,989
mimics the play books of China and

813
00:32:50,959 --> 00:32:56,779
Russia and possibly even Iran it's

814
00:32:53,989 --> 00:32:58,969
sowing discord in there well imagine if

815
00:32:56,779 --> 00:33:01,489
you're taking these fakes that are very

816
00:32:58,969 --> 00:33:03,469
believable and very real the amount of

817
00:33:01,489 --> 00:33:05,359
damage that could be done in a short

818
00:33:03,469 --> 00:33:08,779
amount of time by making a believable

819
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:10,609
something out there now this sucks

820
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:11,899
because quite frankly I don't know what

821
00:33:10,609 --> 00:33:14,570
to believe anymore I'll be perfectly

822
00:33:11,899 --> 00:33:16,458
honest with you it is so hard to try to

823
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:18,408
believe anything you see anymore and the

824
00:33:16,459 --> 00:33:22,190
more I delve into this the more I

825
00:33:18,409 --> 00:33:23,629
realize how hard it is to understand and

826
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:25,579
even to prove some of the sources on

827
00:33:23,629 --> 00:33:28,339
this stuff it's a matter of being very

828
00:33:25,579 --> 00:33:31,450
very safe and and trying to do what you

829
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:33,950
can with it but it's very tough these

830
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:36,019
these digital manipulation things that

831
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:38,450
we're talking about are a great way to

832
00:33:36,019 --> 00:33:40,159
do that I mentioned how you know I saw

833
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:41,719
some photos and the coronavirus and they

834
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:44,179
had people stacked it looked like they

835
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:47,389
were just elbow-to-elbow when in fact

836
00:33:44,179 --> 00:33:50,379
turning to the side they weren't these

837
00:33:47,389 --> 00:33:52,849
are the things remember a photo a video

838
00:33:50,379 --> 00:33:55,939
these things are being done to tell a

839
00:33:52,849 --> 00:33:58,939
story and the story is being whatever it

840
00:33:55,940 --> 00:34:01,339
is that person wants to tell you it's

841
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:02,680
important to look around both edges of

842
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:04,230
that right

843
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,710
so audio fakes let's get into that

844
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:08,889
romance scams

845
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:11,139
again here's Yanni sending grandma a

846
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:13,270
audio clip of you know professing his

847
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:16,150
love well there's plenty of material to

848
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:18,550
get these audio clips from out there so

849
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:20,530
that's not really a problem right we get

850
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:23,290
that stuff together what about an

851
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:26,620
election influencing again what about

852
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:29,770
intercepting a fake phone call okay

853
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:32,460
hey here's you know so-and-so politician

854
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:36,429
speaking about something absolutely

855
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:37,929
mind-blowing in this thing and releasing

856
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:40,659
that like you know just like with the

857
00:34:37,929 --> 00:34:42,040
videos and then turning down to again

858
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:44,139
I'd mentioned it before and this is why

859
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,340
I mention it what about CEO fraud are

860
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:47,830
different types of business email

861
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:51,760
compromised one of the counters we

862
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:54,639
recommend to people is don't wire that

863
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:56,590
money until you've actually talked to

864
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,450
the person who said that you need to

865
00:34:56,590 --> 00:35:01,000
transfer a million dollars right whether

866
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:04,120
it's a CEO CFO whatever their need to be

867
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,580
processes in place for that well imagine

868
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:09,009
they get the email and now they get a

869
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:13,000
phone call just a couple minutes later

870
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:13,420
and it's the CEO saying hey I sent you

871
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,180
an email

872
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:18,450
need you to take care of that I'm in a

873
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:23,350
meeting gotta go bye

874
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:24,910
okay it sounds like the CEO maybe they

875
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:26,710
pulled information you know or they

876
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:28,810
pulled the audio clips off of some talk

877
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:31,720
or presentation the CEO gave or news

878
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:34,450
article or whatever but now the person

879
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:36,220
just goes oh well it's been validated in

880
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:38,980
my mind because I got the phone call

881
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:41,020
just like text messages work right doing

882
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:42,790
the hybrid attacks with an email and a

883
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:44,500
text message but being able to put that

884
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:46,690
together now the person is just gonna go

885
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:49,450
oh it must be real and fire off the

886
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:51,280
money that's a dangerous thing this is

887
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:53,710
why when I talk about policies for this

888
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:57,280
sort of thing I say there has to be a

889
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:59,710
callback to a known good number not

890
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:02,680
somebody calling you or giving you a

891
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:04,780
number in the email right that will help

892
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:06,220
counter this but imagine how people let

893
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:08,680
their guard down as soon as they get

894
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:10,930
that second form of validation that's

895
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:14,540
where I think we're gonna see a lot of

896
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:16,549
this kind of stuff going on now

897
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:19,730
there was this story you may have seen

898
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:22,370
it they claim that this is how this

899
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:23,540
happened for a CEO fraud wire transfer

900
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:26,210
it was quite a bit of money got

901
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:31,220
transferred and they claimed that it was

902
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:33,170
the CEO that called now what I found is

903
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:36,319
there's no supporting evidence yet that

904
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:38,750
this was a deep fake call although they

905
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,370
they tried to lean it on that it could

906
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:42,710
have very easily been a voice actor or

907
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:44,870
somebody with a close you know voice to

908
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:49,190
the person I think that's probably more

909
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:50,990
likely however this kind of stuff is

910
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:53,000
already kind of going on with faking the

911
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:56,509
voice now when I was at RSA this year

912
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,070
that seems like so long ago when I was

913
00:36:56,510 --> 00:37:00,500
at RSA this year there was actually a

914
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:02,480
booth that was set up and their whole

915
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:05,930
thing was looking for deep fakes and

916
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:08,300
audio calls and their clientele was

917
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:11,690
going to it was a call centers

918
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:14,000
essentially big call centers things like

919
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:15,500
that and I actually learned a lot from

920
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,090
them about how call centers work where

921
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:20,810
they basically start building a score on

922
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:22,160
you for fraud when you call in so did

923
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:23,630
you call from a mobile number is it

924
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:26,859
already a known number are you

925
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:29,030
connecting from you know a known place

926
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:31,400
location whatever if they can get that

927
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:33,920
but they're also starting to listen to

928
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:36,740
the voice and their whole sales thing

929
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:39,110
was about being able to identify whether

930
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:42,620
the voice was a digitized voice or not

931
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:45,320
and essentially once you finally get to

932
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:45,799
that person in the call center to speak

933
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,310
to him

934
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:51,680
that person in the call center has a

935
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:53,840
basically a flag that says hey this is

936
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:57,799
how much we trust this person it

937
00:37:53,840 --> 00:38:01,100
basically gives a numeric grading on the

938
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:02,420
possibility of fraud and this and I

939
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:04,940
believe it ties into some of those times

940
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:06,680
where they'll ask you to verify another

941
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:09,200
piece of information that may because

942
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:11,480
something happened you know but I did

943
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:15,080
ask Lee I said how many times have you

944
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:16,910
actually seen in a verified way that

945
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:19,130
this has happened in the real world and

946
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:20,569
of course he pointed to this story right

947
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,520
here and I said well it really wasn't

948
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:24,980
verified in any way shape or form tell

949
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:26,420
me how many of you seen verified and he

950
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:27,380
couldn't give me an answer to that and

951
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,490
that's okay

952
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:30,530
that's all right

953
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:32,299
because I think it's going to start

954
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:34,010
happening and it's good that we're

955
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:35,420
thinking about that but be careful from

956
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:37,340
some of the snake oil that's that's

957
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:39,530
still going out on this but I think this

958
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:42,560
is gonna be a very very powerful way to

959
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:44,480
weaponize this sort of voice cloning

960
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,130
stuff and the the activity that I've

961
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,500
been seeing lately on that voz voice

962
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:49,880
clone and stuff there makes me believe

963
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,530
that there's a lot of interest in

964
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:54,710
getting this stuff up and running well

965
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:56,150
and so I think we're gonna see in the

966
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:59,210
next couple of years where it's actually

967
00:38:56,150 --> 00:39:01,670
a very believable voice that's coming

968
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:04,430
out of these things so let's talk about

969
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:06,230
how we detect these you know speaking

970
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:08,330
with the gentleman that I was talking

971
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:11,840
about there at RSA how they did it well

972
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:14,420
the artifacts always remain and this is

973
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:15,770
video this is audio this is whatever

974
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:18,560
there's always going to be artifacts

975
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:20,540
when you do deep fake videos there's

976
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,520
going to be smoothing of the pixels

977
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:24,740
around where the two faces are blended

978
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:26,720
okay there's some ways to try to get

979
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:31,250
around that now if you do it and say

980
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:33,259
high res say you do it in HD and you do

981
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:34,910
all of your cloning there and then re

982
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:35,960
encode it a couple times you know if

983
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:37,549
we've ever seen the pictures have been

984
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:39,020
uploaded and recompressed a couple of

985
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:43,430
times eight they just fall apart same

986
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:46,520
with videos so if you introduce some of

987
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:49,100
that stuff to it you can kind of fake

988
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:52,040
some of this fake stuff out right and it

989
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:53,359
can hurt the detection of it too when it

990
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:56,210
comes to looking at the digital

991
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:58,880
artifacts but you always have some sort

992
00:39:56,210 --> 00:40:02,619
of artifact when the video or audio is

993
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:05,210
running the compression piece in sound

994
00:40:02,619 --> 00:40:07,790
our brains do some pretty cool stuff

995
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:09,170
again you know we've all seen those you

996
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:11,600
know the text things where the first and

997
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:13,310
the last letter or you know whatever are

998
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:15,319
correct and in the middle isn't but our

999
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:17,690
brain still kind of makes that out we do

1000
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:20,060
the same thing with sounds our brain

1001
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:21,830
pieces these things together even if

1002
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:23,630
it's not perfect and gives it to us

1003
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:25,490
perfect we see this when we talk to

1004
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:29,480
people with strong accents sometimes

1005
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:31,189
where our comprehension lags a minute or

1006
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,630
so or maybe not a minute but a few

1007
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:34,910
seconds behind if you've ever been in a

1008
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:36,740
conversation where your comprehension

1009
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:39,710
lags behind that's because your brain is

1010
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:42,350
taking sounds that don't make sense and

1011
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:45,490
building it into things that do

1012
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:50,600
a lot of times what happens is we use

1013
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:52,339
sounds in words or phrases that our

1014
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:55,549
tongue cannot be making the same sound

1015
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:58,850
that quickly following up so we actually

1016
00:40:55,550 --> 00:41:00,860
adjust to the sounds that we make pretty

1017
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:02,779
regularly depending on the sentence

1018
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:05,180
we're saying now the AI doesn't do that

1019
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:09,170
so it may put two sounds together that

1020
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:11,210
you physically can't make but because of

1021
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:13,130
the way it's all done it sounds good and

1022
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:16,490
you won't notice the difference between

1023
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:18,950
if a real person says it but digitally

1024
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:21,339
you will see that and you can see that

1025
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:24,980
there are going to be artifacts in that

1026
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:27,440
this is we're using AI to detect AI can

1027
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:29,300
be a pretty powerful thing

1028
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,860
there will be automation for all of this

1029
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:32,480
stuff if I'm not mistaken YouTube

1030
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:35,180
Facebook and them they're already kind

1031
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,620
of looking for deep fakes and looking

1032
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:38,899
for some of this stuff through the the

1033
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:40,759
software as well already when things are

1034
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:43,280
being uploaded and of course they're

1035
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:44,480
tagging things not necessarily removing

1036
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,270
them and that's enough whole nother hot

1037
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,620
topics but using a neural network to

1038
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:50,900
detect these fakes I think is where

1039
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:53,359
we're gonna be able to have the most

1040
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:55,280
success in this and that's kind of what

1041
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:57,140
they were doing in that RS a guy he was

1042
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,420
they were looking at the audio that was

1043
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:01,490
coming in analyzing it and looking for

1044
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:03,800
things like that in order to help

1045
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:06,319
influence that trust score if you will

1046
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,700
when you get to the person this is gonna

1047
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:11,470
be the biggest way that we're gonna be

1048
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:15,379
able to detect face now when it comes to

1049
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:18,439
these things and we all have biases we

1050
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:20,150
absolutely have biases and deep fakes

1051
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:23,360
are gonna enhance these prejudices and

1052
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:24,620
biases now what's gonna happen is we

1053
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:28,610
have to realize if it's something that

1054
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:31,160
we agree with already we are going to

1055
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:35,020
want to believe it therefore it takes

1056
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:38,120
more for us to disbelieve something we

1057
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:39,350
kind of already believe in then to throw

1058
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,819
something under the bus that we don't

1059
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:42,980
already right let's think about this

1060
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:45,200
this is us as humans and we have to be

1061
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:46,580
honest with ourselves about this if you

1062
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:49,040
see something in social media that

1063
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:50,930
aligns with your political views how

1064
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:53,450
prone are you to be critical about it

1065
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:55,919
and or go peel apart all of the facts

1066
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:57,689
behind it you're probably not

1067
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:00,119
this is just a human thing but if it's

1068
00:42:57,690 --> 00:43:02,279
something that disagrees with you you

1069
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:03,660
already disagree and you're going to

1070
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:05,430
look for those things that prove the

1071
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:07,828
negative as opposed to proving the

1072
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:10,288
positive I hope that makes sense to you

1073
00:43:07,829 --> 00:43:12,450
but what all boils down to is you don't

1074
00:43:10,289 --> 00:43:14,250
need high tech to manipulate people who

1075
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:16,410
want to believe something we see this

1076
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:18,180
again in romance scams all the time

1077
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:21,058
he throws something up there and you say

1078
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:24,149
hey look grandma this is a picture of

1079
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:26,010
the person you're talking to that says

1080
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:28,260
they're a doctor when actually there are

1081
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:32,309
car salesmen in Des Moines Iowa

1082
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:34,410
that's their real persona and then when

1083
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:36,000
they go back and they challenge the

1084
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:38,640
person on that then they say something

1085
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,500
like oh yeah well I have to hide that my

1086
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:43,410
identity a little bit because so-and-so

1087
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:46,799
and the person wants to believe the lie

1088
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:48,240
behind the deception and it's really

1089
00:43:46,799 --> 00:43:50,220
it's a crazy thing if you ever dealt

1090
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:53,009
with people in romance scams they will

1091
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:55,799
continue to justify what they're seeing

1092
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:56,730
over and over again regardless of the

1093
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:59,220
proof you throw at them

1094
00:43:56,730 --> 00:44:02,039
so the truth is out there we have to

1095
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:04,049
care enough to look for it this sort of

1096
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:07,829
technology is definitely going to be

1097
00:44:04,049 --> 00:44:09,690
making things tougher for us to be able

1098
00:44:07,829 --> 00:44:12,269
to do this to be able to determine the

1099
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:15,930
truth so how do we defend ourselves in

1100
00:44:12,269 --> 00:44:17,910
our organisations man honestly all of

1101
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:20,098
these sorts of attacks generally in

1102
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:22,558
social engineering they're going to rely

1103
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:24,509
on an emotional aspect so if you get an

1104
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:28,589
email a text message something like that

1105
00:44:24,509 --> 00:44:31,529
and it gets you riled up you see social

1106
00:44:28,589 --> 00:44:33,509
media posts it gets you riled up be very

1107
00:44:31,529 --> 00:44:35,519
very cautious okay

1108
00:44:33,509 --> 00:44:38,309
it doesn't mean it's automatically an

1109
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:39,868
attack or it's a fake but these are the

1110
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:40,440
ploys that are being done the social

1111
00:44:39,869 --> 00:44:41,910
engineering

1112
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:43,680
you know they leverage greed right the

1113
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:45,089
nigerian prince right how long has he

1114
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:47,509
been trying to give away numb money

1115
00:44:45,089 --> 00:44:50,549
right money for nothing sort of thing

1116
00:44:47,509 --> 00:44:52,529
curiosity click bait ads right you won't

1117
00:44:50,549 --> 00:44:55,288
believe what we caught this person doing

1118
00:44:52,529 --> 00:44:57,839
bla bla bla bla bla or the top 5 things

1119
00:44:55,289 --> 00:45:00,000
that did it at a number 4 will blow your

1120
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:02,009
mind right these are information gap

1121
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,890
theory sorts of things and it's a

1122
00:45:02,009 --> 00:45:06,420
pattern interruption theory as well

1123
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:07,618
but basically what they do is they give

1124
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:09,600
you a little bit of information don't

1125
00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:11,100
give you the rest you have the FOMO fear

1126
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,540
singing out and it drives people to

1127
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:14,100
click that's why we see him everywhere

1128
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:16,320
because it actually works it's the

1129
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:17,850
emotional trigger that pulls us into

1130
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:19,530
these things we don't want to be left

1131
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:21,150
out and not know the answer to that

1132
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:23,520
so curiosity is great obviously

1133
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:26,160
self-interest always now urgency is

1134
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:28,830
interesting because I had someone at one

1135
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:32,149
talk tell me that they actually saw a

1136
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:34,170
phishing email that was no urgency right

1137
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:36,120
and I was like you mean that this

1138
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:38,010
phishing email came in it's like yeah

1139
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:40,140
whenever you get around to it if you

1140

feel like it do this this and this and

1141
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:46,680
they were like yeah I personally have

1142
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:49,560
never seen a phishing attack a smishing

1143
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:51,600
attack or even a phishing attack that

1144
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:54,420
doesn't have a sense of urgency you know

1145
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:56,670
my car warranty is going to expire ASAP

1146
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:57,810
call us now or you know press 1 to talk

1147
00:45:56,670 --> 00:46:00,330
to somebody who's gonna rip you off

1148
00:45:57,810 --> 00:46:03,120
there's always urge encima hind that you

1149
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:04,590
know SMS text the the whole hate your

1150
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:06,240
account may have been compromised login

1151
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:08,400
now there's a sense of urgency implied

1152
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:10,649
right there none of it's like ah you

1153
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,690
know don't really care so if there's

1154
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:14,340
urgency be careful

1155
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:15,930
doesn't mean it's an attack usually

1156
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:19,230
gonna be there be careful

1157
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:21,540
fear fear is an interesting thing fear

1158
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:24,210
gets people either to engage or back

1159
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:28,070
away very very quickly it's kind of a

1160
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:28,070
weird sort of thing

1161
00:46:28,349 --> 00:46:34,650
more than fear outrage and anger drives

1162
00:46:32,369 --> 00:46:36,210
human anger and that's why we'll see a

1163
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:38,670
lot of this stuff in there the stuff I'm

1164
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:41,309
talking about here with the social media

1165
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:44,279
especially outrage and anger are the

1166
00:46:41,309 --> 00:46:46,470
number one and two ways to get people to

1167
00:46:44,279 --> 00:46:48,930
take action it's a very very powerful

1168
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:52,499
way to do that but fear can do it too

1169
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:54,269
right we've even seen scams if if you

1170
00:46:52,499 --> 00:46:56,819
all saw this it was I think it was last

1171
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:59,549
year we saw some stuff going on like in

1172
00:46:56,819 --> 00:47:02,970
Southern California where a parent would

1173
00:46:59,549 --> 00:47:04,619
get a call from a scammer saying hey we

1174
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:06,058
know little Johnny went to this junior

1175
00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:08,609
high school we picked them up on the way

1176
00:47:06,059 --> 00:47:10,589
to school and have little Johnny if you

1177
00:47:08,609 --> 00:47:12,598
don't pay us money within the next hour

1178
00:47:10,589 --> 00:47:15,779
you know you'll never see little Johnny

1179
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:18,359
again if you contact the the news or you

1180
00:47:15,779 --> 00:47:20,880
contact the police or the school little

1181
00:47:18,359 --> 00:47:23,038
Johnny's a goner right and so they were

1182
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,839
trying to get people to send them ransom

1183
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:26,279
money based on that meanwhile little

1184
00:47:24,839 --> 00:47:28,229
Johnny's fat dumb and happy at school

1185
00:47:26,279 --> 00:47:29,640
nothing has happened but they use social

1186
00:47:28,229 --> 00:47:31,019
media to figure it out now that's a

1187
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:33,450
fear-based thing that would terrify you

1188
00:47:31,019 --> 00:47:34,950
for real as a parent right whether you

1189
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:37,828
believe it or not I mean when you're

1190
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:39,210
under that kind of stress and that kind

1191
00:47:37,829 --> 00:47:42,390
of concern especially if they can give

1192
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:43,979
you some details about little Johnny and

1193
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:45,629
you know maybe they they see the

1194
00:47:43,979 --> 00:47:47,368
schedule from your social media posts or

1195
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:48,509
whatever you know we grab an on the way

1196
00:47:47,369 --> 00:47:50,489
to swim practice

1197
00:47:48,509 --> 00:47:52,410
make it real that's some terrifying

1198
00:47:50,489 --> 00:47:54,119
stuff that really really messes with how

1199
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:57,058
people can apply critical thinking and

1200
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:59,339
of course helpfulness is another one you

1201
00:47:57,059 --> 00:48:01,979
know the old I'm stuck in the UK

1202
00:47:59,339 --> 00:48:03,960
somebody robbed me I have no money or

1203
00:48:01,979 --> 00:48:07,529
passport I need money to get home please

1204
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:09,660
help me or you know someone calling the

1205
00:48:07,529 --> 00:48:12,390
elderly folks saying hey this is little

1206
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:14,219
Johnny's lawyer he got put in jail for

1207
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:16,049
something that is absolutely not his

1208
00:48:14,219 --> 00:48:18,150
fault but we need to bail him out he

1209
00:48:16,049 --> 00:48:19,829
said that you could help well the

1210
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:21,210
elderly folks tend to be very helpful

1211
00:48:19,829 --> 00:48:23,759
they tend to have some money you know

1212
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:26,460
stowed away on occasion and that's why

1213
00:48:23,759 --> 00:48:29,700
that scam works so anytime you get these

1214
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:32,369
kind of emotional urges or emotional

1215
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:34,348
kick in the pants be super cautious

1216
00:48:32,369 --> 00:48:36,450
about what's going on and we need to

1217
00:48:34,349 --> 00:48:39,170
relay that information to our family to

1218
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:41,730
our friends to our employees to

1219
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:44,760
basically everyone we can talk to

1220
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:46,950
try to reapply the critical thinking

1221
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:49,080
part move out of that like you know

1222
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:51,868
system one reactive type stuff into

1223
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:56,970
critical thinking pieces and it will

1224
00:48:51,869 --> 00:48:58,080
benefit you greatly now this is

1225
00:48:56,970 --> 00:48:59,939
something I do put up because people

1226
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:01,590
absolutely love this when it comes to

1227
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:04,200
like employees or it doesn't matter

1228
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:07,380
parents whatever put it up print it out

1229
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:10,080

1231
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:14,880

1232
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:16,200
people say hey I got an email at you

Saturday for my HR department and that's

1235
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,090
kind of weird

1236
00:49:18,810 --> 00:49:23,430

how many different versions of Mei Jong

1247
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:47,430
she has on her computer because she

1248
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:50,100
downloads stuff and installs it all the

1249
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:52,190
time right and and and she believes a

1250
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:55,500
lot of this stuff I get questions about

1251
