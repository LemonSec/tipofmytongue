1
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:17,698
everyone welcome to the I guess 3 p.m.

2
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:23,340
Eastern session I'm here today to talk

3
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:24,330
to you about the laughs versus rasp if

4
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,849
you don't know what those terms are

5
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,009
that's fine I'll definitely dig in them

6
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:32,040
a little bit further but first off I

7
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,480
wanted to kind of introduce myself I'm

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,030
David Linder I'm the director of apps

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,218
tech at contrast security also known as

10
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,250
golf hacker Dave and numerous platforms

11
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:43,320
including Twitter I've been around the

12
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,320
application security space for the

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,600
better part of 20 years and you know

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,309
I've seen things come and go and seen

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,550
kind of the waves the way we do

16
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:55,680
development and all that good stuff so

17
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:57,599
you know jumping right in you know not

18
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,649
so breaking news you know everyone here

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,500
is totally in the in the news

20
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:06,659
understanding that you know our

21
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,479
applications are under attack they're

22
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:12,479
vulnerable and you know for years and

23
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:15,330
years and years we've tried to you know

24
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:18,150
either manually or programmatically or

25
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:23,360
adding software detection all this stuff

26
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:25,290
to to find and and prevent

27
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,869
vulnerabilities from being attacked and

28
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:31,320
exploited right but there's there's some

29
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:32,790
things that you know I want to talk

30
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,939
about you know from it from a data

31
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:40,070
perspective before I really dig into you

32
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:42,149
know just a small piece of the layers of

33
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:44,460
protections that we've put in place over

34
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,930
the years you know and and and some of

35
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,380
that comes down to you know the average

36
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:52,470
application if we look at development

37
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:55,320
these days the average application is

38
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:58,439
only 21 percent of what we would

39
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,658
consider like custom code you know first

40
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:04,020
party code whatever you might call it

41
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:05,759
today right and in that code you know

42
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,798
we're seeing quite a few vulnerabilities

43
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,348
and then the rest that the bottom part

44
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:13,860
of that that iceberg if you will you

45
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:16,019
know the 78 or 79 percent

46
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,270
is library code so we're bringing in all

47
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:21,120
these libraries from you know semi

48
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:22,320
trusted trusted untrusted sources you

49
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,060
know we may need one piece of

50
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,890
functionality from from this library

51
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,720
that library may be a million lines of

52
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,929
code and we're only using you know one

53
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:33,660
class or method and the reality is is

54
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:35,610
there's not necessarily nearly as many

55
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,430
vulnerabilities in what we're pulling in

56
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:41,820
to our custom code so you know you look

57
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:43,260
at you know year over year and like I

58
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,660
said I've been doing this for a while

59
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:48,630
you know I was in consulting for for for

60
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:50,010
some time and the reality is the number

61
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:51,750
of serious vulnerabilities or

62
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,910
vulnerabilities in general and our

63
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:57,209
software applications hasn't really

64
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:58,920
changed you know things have shifted a

65
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:01,920
little bit we've added all sorts of

66
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,929
standards you know it started way back

67
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,940
with some of the formal methods and then

68
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:08,370
you start talking about OS top ten

69
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:10,050
coming out you know for those of us a

70
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,580
knapsack have heard about the top ten

71
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:14,250
for four years and years and years I

72
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,690
kind of started out as a hey you might

73
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,670
want to think about these things too now

74
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:21,600
it's in like standards bodies right like

75
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:25,260
in a PCI and and mist 853 and things

76
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:27,239
like that where may not have been meant

77
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:30,570
to be there but you know we've tried to

78
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:34,500
do all these things over the years to

79
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:37,560
really help drive you know security

80
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:41,670
expertise and and building secure

81
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:43,890
software you know and now if you look at

82
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:46,350
the space you know we're doing things

83
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:49,048
much much more quickly we're talking

84
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:52,440
DevOps deficit shifting left all these

85
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:54,810
you know new terms but really what it

86
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:57,120
comes down to is we're adding more and

87
00:03:54,810 --> 00:04:00,840
more engineers we're writing more and

88
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,900
more code and we don't have nearly as

89
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,810
many you know security folks that are

90
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:11,310
needed to keep up with that growth on

91
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:12,630
numerous spectrums so you know one nice

92
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,130
thing about working for a software

93
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:16,579
security companies we have a lot of data

94
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:19,048
right you know we see a lot of things

95
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:21,090
with the different applications that

96
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:23,969
were either you know detecting bones or

97
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:25,739
protecting things against so I'm a big

98
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,330
data person I like to pull data out and

99
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,180
just really like dig in

100
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:32,878
to that data and you know based on a

101
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:35,400
year's worth of data from all the

102
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:37,620
applications that were protecting

103
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:41,008
there's you know over 13,000 attacks

104
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:43,740
detected per application per month you

105
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:45,449
know that's a ton but if you think about

106
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:49,789
it you know a lot of that is you know

107
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:51,659
just drive by scanning and you know

108
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:53,280
script kiddies and things like that that

109
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:55,560
are that are going on the internet and

110
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,500
some of it could be like legit I'm

111
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:01,800
assessing my application or bug hunters

112
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:05,969
or what-have-you right but you know as

113
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:08,789
far as what's actually landing only 98%

114
00:05:05,969 --> 00:05:11,580
of those attacks are actually landing

115
00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:13,979
and target of vulnerabilities right so

116
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,568
you can see over time the the increase

117
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:17,580
in the attacks that are that are

118
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:20,759
detected you know the interesting thing

119
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:22,889
to note is you know we've all been kind

120
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:25,199
of working from home and this whole code

121
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:28,680
thing and if you look around the March

122
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,479
April into May time frame the attacks

123
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,039
detected have gone up dramatically I

124
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:36,240
don't know if there's a correlation

125
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:38,490
there but it's one way for me to look at

126
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,379
this data and be like oh people are at

127
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:42,479
home maybe they're they're being a

128
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:44,819
little more malicious or or testing

129
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,289
things a little more rate but you can

130
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:48,870
definitely see that those those numbers

131
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:51,659
are increasing the vulnerability types

132
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:55,349
by language are also targeted

133
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:57,150
differently which at first glance sounds

134
00:05:55,349 --> 00:05:58,440
like why is that do they know what

135
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:00,029
language it is well sometimes they

136
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,219
probably do write you know you may be

137
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:04,560
targeting different things like you know

138
00:06:02,219 --> 00:06:06,900
a long section and og mail injection and

139
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,539
stuff is like a java type of thing right

140
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:12,258
so you're gonna naturally see more

141
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:15,000
attacks against those sorts of

142
00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:17,310
vulnerabilities you know but the other

143
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,629
ones like sequel injection path

144
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,949
traversal things like that I would

145
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:22,050
expect them to be a little bit more

146
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:25,919
close you know cross-site scripting is

147
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:29,789
fairly similar but for the most part you

148
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:32,370
know does seem to matter at least at a

149
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:34,919
high level what kind of programming

150
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:38,009
language you are using in your code base

151
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:39,209
and then we kind of overlay it right so

152
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:40,590
what's the likelihood that my

153
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:43,560
application or eight

154
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:45,450
is getting attacked of what kind of

155
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,880
attack type you know I don't really want

156
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:51,300
to dig too far into you know the details

157
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:53,159
of the data from my perspective I want

158
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,660
to dig into laughs and rasp that's what

159
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,139
we're here for

160
00:06:54,660 --> 00:07:01,800
but as you can see you know the attacks

161
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:04,470
coming in are in reality some of the

162
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,630
more egregious vulnerability is the ones

163
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:08,100
that can lead to a bigger payout right

164
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:11,219
you know your your injection type

165
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,660
vulnerabilities and and frankly a lot of

166
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:15,150
those types of vulnerabilities have

167
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:18,900
quick and easy tooling that you can spin

168
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:21,150
up and like a repeater or or you know

169
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,679
intruder or something like that that

170
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:25,229
will easily allow you to just push a

171
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:29,250
button and throw a bunch of payloads at

172
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:32,630
a system but as I kind of mentioned you

173
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:36,960
know early on where we're at this

174
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:41,460
precipice or this place in this software

175
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:45,299
security space where we're calling it

176
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:49,020
more of a crisis you know we have some

177
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:51,030
specialized security staff they're few

178
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:54,950
and far between there's lots of burnout

179
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:58,559
people move around quite frequently

180
00:07:54,950 --> 00:08:01,830
there's tons and tons of tools none of

181
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,930
them work exactly how you would want

182
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:06,210
them to work in your environment so then

183
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:08,400
you have to maybe pull in a few tools to

184
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:10,530
cover the few edge cases that may not

185
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,810
work in the the tool that you had

186
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:15,030
budgeted for or you have to supplement

187
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:17,820
with manual processes which requires

188
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:20,159
your specialized security staff and at

189
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:24,840
the same time we're developing code at a

190
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:27,450
rate that is way above where the budget

191
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:30,239
the tools and the specialized security

192
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:32,968
staff are right you know I think the

193
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,940
last number I saw was there's around 30

194
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:37,830
million professional developers and

195
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,870
that's like full-time that's all they're

196
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:42,060
doing development or in their

197
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:43,890
professional lives and on average

198
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:46,859
they're writing 10,000 lines of code a

199
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:50,569
year you start adding that up and that

200
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:52,980
starts to become a really massive number

201
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:54,360
and that's new lines of code they're

202
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:58,760
fixing old lines have

203
00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:00,779
- right so it's it's a it's a thing that

204
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,160
you know we've been talking about you

205
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:05,880
know software is eating the world right

206
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:08,760
it's it's it truly is and we've got to

207
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:11,130
think of better ways to to help secure

208
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,589
that software knowing that you know

209
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:16,500
we're way behind on the tools budget and

210
00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:17,790
security staff front when it comes to

211
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:21,060
the amount of code that we're turning

212
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:24,390
out and I mean there's there's studies

213
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:27,449
to back that up and so besom build

214
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:29,790
security and maturity model is basically

215
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:32,190
it goes into organization and sees how

216
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:34,589
your security program is doing right and

217
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:35,820
they interviewed 122 of the

218
00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:39,149
organizations that went through they're

219
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:42,839
decent progress process and out of that

220
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:45,660
those 122 on average they had one

221
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:49,500
software security person for every 73

222
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:51,260
developers if that's not astounding to

223
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:55,769
you it is to me

224
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:58,769
but think about that right so I've got a

225
00:09:55,769 --> 00:10:00,480
one person / 73 developers who are

226
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:02,490
writing close to a million lines of code

227
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,190
a year new code plus they're fixing all

228
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:07,500
their old code at the same time and I've

229
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:12,149
one person attributed to all of that

230
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:13,380
work right it's not sustainable and it

231
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:16,800
could be multiple languages multiple

232
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:19,560
tools processes threat models design

233
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,189
reviews you name it right not

234
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:24,239
sustainable

235
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:26,490
so now we'll dig into the the crux of

236
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,500
what I wanted to talk about today so

237
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:31,260
what problem are we facing you know we

238
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,730
started facing this problem way back you

239
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:35,899
know I've been on this for for a long

240
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:38,459
time you know back in the days of oh

241
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:40,380
we're getting pretty good at firewalls

242
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:42,479
right we're getting pretty good at just

243
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:45,329
saying no we can't allow any of that in

244
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,870
or out and then the web was kind of a

245
00:10:45,329 --> 00:10:47,519
thing

246
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:50,220
right and it's like oh well we have to

247
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:54,300
open this hole for port 80 and 443 and

248
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:55,890
our firewall and oh it's layer seven so

249
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:59,790
we can't really do much with that and oh

250
00:10:55,890 --> 00:11:03,390
it's encrypted so what are we what do we

251
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:05,250
do now right so for for the longest time

252
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:06,510
we were just perplexed I'm like oh but

253
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,160
we'll just open it it'll be fine

254
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:09,089
you know people are just

255
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,250
you know viewing their account

256
00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:12,870
statements and and their their bank

257
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:16,470
account information and things like that

258
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:19,379
and then things started to really go

259
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:22,620
downhill from there fast so we're like

260
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:27,540
oh we're really good at at firewalls

261
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:29,339
right so what should we do about that so

262
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,599
that's kind of where the laughs was born

263
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:33,180
right you know the Web Application

264
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:36,660
Firewall we're good at firewalls why not

265
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:39,388
do something along those lines but

266
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:44,519
dedicate it for applications or web type

267
00:11:39,389 --> 00:11:47,579
traffic so around 2002 modsecurity was

268
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:49,529
kind of the first real I guess laugh if

269
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:53,239
you will right so we did like I said we

270
00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:56,879
tried to create this firewall like thing

271
00:11:53,240 --> 00:12:00,920
to solve a networking problem that

272
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:05,160
really wasn't a networking problem and

273
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:06,990
so we created this laugh to to detect

274
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,509
things at layer seven which we didn't

275
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:11,610
really have with our you know our other

276
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:14,730
types of firewalls that were you know a

277
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:18,329
much lower level review of the traffic

278
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:21,000
coming in and out so again you know a

279
00:12:18,329 --> 00:12:23,569
laugh is the the layer 7 stuff it's used

280
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,189
to stop scanning potential attacks

281
00:12:23,569 --> 00:12:27,870
against your your application layer so

282
00:12:26,189 --> 00:12:32,759
the traffic coming to and from your web

283
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:34,319
and API type applications you know

284
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:37,560
there's there's some tuning that needs

285
00:12:34,319 --> 00:12:39,209
to be done with this you know and a lot

286
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:44,399
of alerting you know the one thing that

287
00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:46,469
that a wife has is is this alerting

288
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,300
mechanism and right away it's like oh my

289
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:50,610
gosh there's a lot of things going on

290
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:52,800
there's a lot of alerting so we started

291
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:55,319
turning tuning things away because alert

292
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:58,079
fatigue is also real right and if you

293
00:12:55,319 --> 00:12:59,130
start getting all these alerts you know

294
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,279
we're getting all these false positives

295
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:03,870
we're not even sure what to do with it

296
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:06,839
but we know we need it right because our

297
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:09,689
other firewalls can't can't do anything

298
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:11,730
with this traffic and we know that

299
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:14,009
there's a tax going on because every

300
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:16,829
report from you know the beginning of

301
00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:19,110
time has told us and showed us the data

302
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:21,630
to back that that up right we're seeing

303
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:24,360
all of these potential attacks

304
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:26,100
against all of our applications and then

305
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,640
it was discovered that there's a lot of

306
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:32,340
tuning that that would be required to

307
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:35,400
you know on board applications to to be

308
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:37,560
fronted by a laugh now that was 20 years

309
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:39,329
ago it's gotten a little bit better but

310
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:42,420
they're still tuning and all kind of dig

311
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:44,790
into to that as we go on so how does it

312
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:48,510
work at a very high level right you know

313
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:51,510
so you know early on you know in-app

314
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:54,330
second sequel injection there was always

315
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:56,790
this oh my gosh I can bypass the login

316
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:59,550
right I can just add or one equals one -

317
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:02,250
- and it will ignore the password and

318
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:04,859
I'll be able to to log in as the first

319
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:08,190
user in the table or the admin if I know

320
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:10,380
the username right so how it works is it

321
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:12,570
says oh I'm gonna look at the input

322
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:14,580
strings you know whether it's parameters

323
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:16,800
whether it's headers what will have you

324
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:18,870
and it's going to run a bunch of regular

325
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,540
expressions and rules against that

326
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:22,860
string and if it thinks it detects

327
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,839
something like in this case it would say

328
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:27,390
ho this looks fishy this looks like

329
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:30,210
sequel injection I'm gonna block that

330
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:32,310
right just blindly block it not blindly

331
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:34,050
but you know based on its rules and it's

332
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:37,319
regular expressions it's running I'm

333
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:42,120
just gonna block it so you know what if

334
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:44,880
I had the same input box but now I

335
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:47,940
changed the attack type so instead of

336
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,240
the sequel injection the or one equals

337
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,550
one

338
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,980
now I'm gonna try something that's more

339
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:55,199
like command injection let's see if

340
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:58,470
that's you know piping it to some

341
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:00,420
command exe or something like that so

342
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:03,090
again what is the laughs - it looks at

343
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:05,400
that input and says oh hmm this looks

344
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:09,030
like command injection I'm gonna go

345
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:10,260
ahead and block it which for the longest

346
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:13,290
time we're like oh this is great but

347
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:16,260
there were so many bypasses right and

348
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:18,020
I'll talk about some of that so here's

349
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:20,490
this analogy that that I kind of like

350
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:25,470
you know it makes me chuckle a little

351
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:27,090
bit but imagine that you want to zoo and

352
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:30,089
and you've got these beautiful monkeys

353
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:33,540
and you know I've been to a lot of zoos

354
00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:35,430
where you can you know purchase food for

355
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:39,060
the animals

356
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:40,260
and so you go to the zoo and you know

357
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:42,209
you own the zoo and all the sudden you

358
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:44,939
realize that people aren't just giving

359
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:47,040
the monkeys the bananas that you're

360
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:48,810
selling they're giving them stuff from

361
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,790
off the street and other fruits and

362
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:53,899
other things that that that you don't

363
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:56,490
want them to eat so you built this

364
00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:58,860
elaborate fencing system that can detect

365
00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:01,080
to what people are trying to put through

366
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:03,690
it or throw over it and so it's only

367
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:05,430
gonna allow bananas right and you're so

368
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:07,170
happy and excited about that because

369
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:09,420
it's gonna block everything else and and

370
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:11,760
let you know that hey these people are

371
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:13,410
trying to feed you know my beautiful

372
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:17,490
animals things that they shouldn't be

373
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:19,560
fed so it's similar to a left right like

374
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:21,810
it's it's just gonna like blindly attack

375
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,699
the other things based on the rule that

376
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:27,660
you've set that it's only going to allow

377
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:29,550
those bananas to go to the monkeys so

378
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:32,100
again how does it determine that attack

379
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:34,529
you know at a laughs perspective for the

380
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,060
most part it's looking at a bunch of

381
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:39,240
regular expressions and it does these

382
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:41,609
you know very very quickly you know it

383
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,260
uses some sort of scoring mechanism you

384
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:45,990
know if you if you do some research into

385
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:46,740
- how laughs work and and how they've

386
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:49,020
been built

387
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:51,150
you know they utilize a fairly

388
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:52,860
structured scoring system so it's not

389
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:55,110
just like oh I hit one regular

390
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:57,330
expression it's automatically detected

391
00:16:55,110 --> 00:17:00,120
as an attack right now it may need to

392
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:02,370
hit a few based on the scores and in all

393
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:04,410
of those things but you know you start

394
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:06,449
looking at these and you know I see the

395
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:09,929
one that says on click error mouse

396
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:13,020
clicks and what that's doing is looking

397
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:16,380
for you know on events with and within

398
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:17,849
the you know the HTML is that one strong

399
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:20,459
enough probably not right I mean the

400
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:22,260
last time we checked there were like 374

401
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:24,449
or on events and that one's only

402
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:26,160
detecting three of them so as an

403
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:28,650
attacker or as someone who wants to feed

404
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:32,580
the monkeys a banana I just need to find

405
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:35,190
the on event that the F is not detecting

406
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:36,570
right so but that's you know for the

407
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:40,290
most part how it's going to determine it

408
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:42,389
so now is the owner I'm realizing that

409
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:44,520
you know my monkeys they're getting

410
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:47,910
really bored of bananas and they're not

411
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,900
they're not really enjoying just having

412
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:50,220
them

413
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:53,550
all day every day they want some other

414
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:56,430
fruits and some other foods so I need to

415
00:17:53,550 --> 00:18:00,570
tune my fancy-schmancy fence that I've

416
00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:02,490
put up to allow some other things you

417
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:04,100
know maybe I want to allow bananas and

418
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:07,800
oranges and peaches and things like that

419
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:11,159
so I need to tune that fence and then

420
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:13,080
now the monkeys are happy again so how

421
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,610
do I tune in you know and this is this

422
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:18,389
is where the tuning comes into play of

423
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:20,159
the laughs right you know it's you look

424
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:22,320
at this like oh my god what what is that

425
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,510
you know it's it's a crazy thing I mean

426
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,370
this is this is a modsecurity

427
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:28,800
rule right I think it's for command

428
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:31,469
injection that you would have to go in

429
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:34,800
and either modify or add to your laughs

430
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:36,180
based on you know what you know you

431
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,220
maybe you've detected a false positive

432
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:39,960
or a false negative or you need to tweak

433
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:42,630
something based on the application that

434
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:45,000
it's protecting you know maybe it's a

435
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:46,380
you know a specialized application

436
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,380
that's doing some things differently

437
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:52,100
than maybe some other just plain Jane

438
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:55,740
you know Java app that's displaying a

439
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:57,719
lunch menu or something right so there's

440
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:59,280
a lot of this tuning that needs to go on

441
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:02,730
you know and there's there's companies

442
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:08,580
that have built services around to just

443
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:12,720
tuning right so but back to you know the

444
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:17,399
the bypass stuff so what happens when

445
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:19,650
our fancy-schmancy fence says oh well it

446
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,960
looks like a banana or an orange and

447
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:25,220
apple but what if that Apple is rotten

448
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:27,780
right what if it looks like an apple but

449
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:30,390
the fence doesn't detect it as an apple

450
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:32,460
or it actually detects it as an apple

451
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:34,950
even though it's rotten and and now our

452
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:37,920
monkeys are getting sick right so that's

453
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:40,470
kind of like all of the tuning that

454
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:42,990
needs to be done and and how hard it is

455
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:46,410
to to block all these things I mean

456
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:49,770
there are just so many bypasses that we

457
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:51,570
see and Twitter's just full of them you

458
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:53,550
know and a lot of it is context of the

459
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:55,399
back-end application a lot of it is

460
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:59,100
understanding what laugh is being

461
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:00,960
fronted and it starts to get really

462
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,330
really difficult to keep up with with

463
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:08,659
all of the different thing

464
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:10,189
that need to occur you know so as far as

465
00:20:08,659 --> 00:20:11,870
you know alert fatigue we talked about

466
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:13,519
that you know there's a lot of alerts a

467
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:15,678
lot of those alerts you're not sure what

468
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:17,210
to do with them should you do anything

469
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,159
with them

470
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:22,100
you know patching fatigue is something

471
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:24,200
that you know is a real thing you know

472
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:26,149
we had a customer come to us once and

473
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,700
they're like hey we have our wife here's

474
00:20:26,149 --> 00:20:31,879
a list of all of the patches that we've

475
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:34,070
had to apply to our laughs does your

476
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,450
rasp protect against these and I've got

477
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:37,250
that here in the screenshots like oh my

478
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:38,990
gosh they've had to apply a patch to

479
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:41,299
their her laughs for all of these

480
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:43,340
different CVS you know common

481
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:45,889
vulnerabilities and exposures and that

482
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:47,000
starts to get to be a lot it's like you

483
00:20:45,889 --> 00:20:48,500
know and some of them may do it

484
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,990
automatically some of them you may not

485
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:53,899
want to apply based on what the backend

486
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:55,880
application is and at the end of the day

487
00:20:53,899 --> 00:20:59,029
it's gonna possibly stop real traffic

488
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:00,919
right I think over time we've gotten

489
00:20:59,029 --> 00:21:02,750
better and been able to tweak these

490
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:05,269
rules and things to the point where

491
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:08,779
they're they're a little more supportive

492
00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:11,750
of more back-end type systems you know I

493
00:21:08,779 --> 00:21:15,529
think the the OWASP core rule set is

494
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:17,710
very good if you're using that I know

495
00:21:15,529 --> 00:21:20,690
there's been some studies and tests done

496
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:23,210
in the in the Azure space that utilize

497
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:26,269
that core rule set that have gotten you

498
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:27,710
know glowing reviews but it's not

499
00:21:26,269 --> 00:21:29,419
perfect it will never be perfect

500
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:31,330
anyone in this space understands there's

501
00:21:29,419 --> 00:21:34,970
always going to be some sort of bypass

502
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:37,010
or or modification needing to occur

503
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:39,440
because there's a false positive that's

504
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:40,639
you know blocking real traffic and you

505
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,620
know when it comes to bypasses there's

506
00:21:40,639 --> 00:21:43,939
always all these interesting ones and I

507
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:47,719
threw a couple out here I just did a

508
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:49,970
quick Twitter search like laughs

509
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:52,940
bypasses right I mean it's it's just all

510
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:55,010
over the place of different ways that

511
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:56,870
people have bought it past laughs

512
00:21:55,010 --> 00:22:00,019
because again it's all signature based

513
00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:02,299
it's looking for very specific things so

514
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:05,149
at some point someone who understands

515
00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:08,779
the the underlying language like the

516
00:22:05,149 --> 00:22:11,689
sequel interpreter that's being used is

517
00:22:08,779 --> 00:22:14,649
probably going to find a bypass for what

518
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:14,649
the laughs is detecting

519
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:21,779
so then you know as time went on you

520
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,639
know and and you know we talked about it

521
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:26,009
like this sulfur security crisis we

522
00:22:23,639 --> 00:22:30,658
started talking about different ways to

523
00:22:26,009 --> 00:22:32,399
help protect our back end applications

524
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:36,090
and and maybe provide a little more

525
00:22:32,399 --> 00:22:38,668
insight into what's going on

526
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:41,999
you know in our production environments

527
00:22:38,669 --> 00:22:43,889
in our applications so this this whole

528
00:22:41,999 --> 00:22:47,039
runtime application self protection or

529
00:22:43,889 --> 00:22:49,379
rasp notion kind of came out a few years

530
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:52,830
ago right it's still pretty new so

531
00:22:49,379 --> 00:22:55,019
fairly in its infancy lots of different

532
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:57,178
organizations have have tried to do it

533
00:22:55,019 --> 00:22:59,519
and fell a little bit back to more of

534
00:22:57,179 --> 00:23:01,710
the laughs type of approach but I wanted

535
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:04,080
to kind of go through the differences of

536
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:08,700
what a rasp is versus what you know the

537
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:11,369
laugh is so rasp is still layer seven

538
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:14,789
right it's still looking at the traffic

539
00:23:11,369 --> 00:23:16,439
that's coming in to an application you

540
00:23:14,789 --> 00:23:17,999
know it's looking at the HTTP requests

541
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,369
just looking at the headers it's looking

542
00:23:17,999 --> 00:23:21,509
at the parameters all of that sort of

543
00:23:20,369 --> 00:23:23,840
thing

544
00:23:21,509 --> 00:23:26,190
it still is going to do alerting right

545
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,619
it's not going to be as much I mean the

546
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:30,450
whole the whole notion of a rasp

547
00:23:28,619 --> 00:23:33,119
something that's living in the

548
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:36,499
application is it should be able to

549
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:39,449
detect attacks at a much more accurate

550
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:41,129
rate than something on the front end

551
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:44,730
that doesn't have the context that a

552
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:47,610
rasp would have Freight from a tuning

553
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:49,879
perspective it really shouldn't and

554
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:52,979
doesn't require a whole lot of tuning

555
00:23:49,879 --> 00:23:54,959
for most of the you know like the sequel

556
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,610
injections the you know command

557
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,070
injections pat reversal those sorts of

558
00:23:56,610 --> 00:24:00,748
rules because the way it does its

559
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:03,960
detection mechanism is a little bit

560
00:24:00,749 --> 00:24:05,820
different with regard to its you know

561
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,350
not necessarily just regular expressions

562
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:09,899
or maybe a plethora of other things are

563
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:12,899
going on and it'll kind of you know give

564
00:24:09,899 --> 00:24:14,580
you guys an example here in a minute so

565
00:24:12,899 --> 00:24:17,969
you know the some of the differences

566
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:19,830
with with this is the rasp has vision

567
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:22,110
into the application you know it's it's

568
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:25,199
living in the application in the running

569
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:27,508
app in prod and it's instrumenting the

570
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,040
the running application in that you know

571
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:30,720
virtual machine if you

572
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:33,809
which allows it to have more

573
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:36,750
intelligence in more context of what's

574
00:24:33,809 --> 00:24:38,760
exactly going on here and it can have it

575
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:40,950
can allow it to make better decisions

576
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,660
right like is this the sequel injection

577
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:44,910
attack okay if it looks like it cool

578
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:47,790
let's follow it through is it ending up

579
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:49,830
in a sequel injection sync is it is it

580
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:51,629
being used in a sequel query because

581
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:53,580
context is important when it comes to a

582
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:55,530
rasp whereas a laugh it doesn't

583
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:58,439
necessarily care about that context it

584
00:24:55,530 --> 00:25:00,000
just knows this looks like an attack you

585
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,760
know and and this you know the thing

586
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,370
about a rasp is a it's like an anywhere

587
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:07,860
took a thing and always on right you can

588
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:10,320
move from one JVM to another and a

589
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:13,080
wholly completely different system or

590
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:16,470
cloud and you don't necessarily have to

591
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:18,659
move the laugh with it right so because

592
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:23,190
it's kind of self-contained in that

593
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:26,130
application so how does it how does it

594
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:28,559
do it right so it's it utilizes software

595
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:31,860
instrumentation you know which is

596
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:34,110
basically debugging to follow the data

597
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:35,820
through the running application so it

598
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:37,770
can see the data coming in and it can

599
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:40,649
see where it's going on right so it can

600
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:42,780
make better decisions on if this is an

601
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:45,240
attack and if it's actually an attack

602
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:48,990
that's going to result in an exploit

603
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:51,179
right so remember we looked at how a

604
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:53,040
laugh works with this sort of input

605
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:56,460
right we see that the contrast or one

606
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:59,760
equals one - - so if I submit this to a

607
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:02,730
system protected by a rasp if the back

608
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,350
end takes that and it says alright this

609
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:07,520
looks like a sequel injection attack but

610
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:10,230
let's kind of look at it further oh it's

611
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:14,309
it's ending up in a sequel sync it's

612
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:16,490
actually going to run this as sequel I'm

613
00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:20,600
gonna block that and now you know that

614
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:22,770
one you're protected for an actual

615
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:25,080
vulnerability or you have a sequel

616
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:27,330
injection vulnerability here and - it

617
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:30,960
will allow you to prioritize how to get

618
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:32,100
that fixed or allow you to push the

619
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,070
priority down because you know you're

620
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:37,050
protected whereas with a rasp you just

621
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:38,700
know you're kind of protected but aren't

622
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:42,389
quite sure if you need to be protected

623
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:45,660
here you know you are but now if I

624
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:47,760
go and I submit the what looks to be a

625
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:51,270
command objection if attack against the

626
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,950
rasp against that same field the rest is

627
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:55,020
made like art cool this looks like

628
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:57,240
command injection looks like they're

629
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:59,280
trying to cat Etsy password it's gonna

630
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,680
follow it through and it's gonna say oh

631
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:04,050
wait now this is going in a sequel query

632
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:06,690
it's going to this isn't detected a

633
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:08,490
sequel injection so I can do a couple

634
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:09,690
things one I can just let it go or I

635
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:13,050
could detect it is what we would call

636
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:14,580
probe so someone could still see that

637
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:16,290
you know there's maybe an attack here

638
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:19,169
but it doesn't have to block that

639
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:21,659
traffic and what this does and you know

640
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:23,730
this is a very specific example but it

641
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:26,670
also helps with the false positive rate

642
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:30,930
and drives that way down because now I

643
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:32,610
can you know not detect some things when

644
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:35,130
they're not going to result in an

645
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:37,199
exploit because I know for sure with

646
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:38,730
with certainty that this command

647
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,140
injection attack it can't resolve a

648
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:43,860
command injection because it's going

649
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:46,860
into you know a sequel query right so

650
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:52,199
let's break it down so I wanted to look

651
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:53,820
at a sequel injection type query right

652
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:56,040
so the first thing we to talk about is a

653
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:59,520
source so a source would be like a

654
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:03,170
parameter or a header so you know as the

655
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:05,520
request comes in to the application the

656
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:08,070
instrumentation engine says oh I see

657
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:10,290
this get parameter it's a string I see

658
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:12,330
that come in it's a source that I need

659
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:14,850
to start doing something with right and

660
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:16,740
so then maybe it you know you can see

661
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:18,629
here the get primer is the user so now I

662
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:21,060
have this what we would call tainted

663
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:24,510
input but I need to do something with I

664
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:27,050
need to do some detection mechanism on

665
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:29,460
that to see if there's a potential

666
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:33,360
exploit occurring or attack and then

667
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:35,220
exploit occurring and then once I've

668
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,889
kind of made that initial determination

669
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:39,630
so say that I've got this input maybe

670
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:41,250
I've run some expressions and

671
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:46,590
some other detection mechanisms against

672
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:49,380
it to get a like increase the score or

673
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:51,209
or whatever with that input and and will

674
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:54,720
tell me like oh I need to follow this

675
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:56,100
now to the the actual output where is it

676
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,500
going to or some

677
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:01,830
we call a sink right so it's going here

678
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:04,770
as you can see into the actual query

679
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:07,470
itself the sequel query or the sink so

680
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:08,789
now I know that hey this is something

681
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:11,490
I've detected as potential sequel

682
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:14,850
injection it's actually ending up in a

683
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:17,850
sequel injection sink and I can choose

684
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:20,580
to now do something with that you know

685
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:22,559
so one example that we could look at you

686
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:25,379
know is you know the username and

687
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:27,110
password the typical approach is like

688
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:29,520
starved from users where user ID equals

689
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:31,439
whatever the user passes in and the

690
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:34,889
password equals you know their password

691
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,870
very simple approach this is you know

692
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:40,080
way back in the day when you could

693
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:44,129
bypass that whole password with the or

694
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:46,168
one equals one - - so what a rasp will

695
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:48,120
do is it will start taking those inputs

696
00:29:46,169 --> 00:29:50,880
and you can see here I've now added or 1

697
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:53,010
equals 1 and some potential commented

698
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,679
blocks and things like that and it will

699
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:57,629
start breaking down this query and it

700
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,789
will say okay cool I've got you know

701
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:02,880
I've got my select statement I've got

702
00:29:59,789 --> 00:30:05,850
the result table ID so on and so forth

703
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:09,330
and it can look at this and it can start

704
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:11,459
tokenizing it and it can can understand

705
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:12,120
and realize when some boundary is

706
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:14,429
crossed

707
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:18,510
you know that user ID it should just be

708
00:30:14,429 --> 00:30:21,809
a literal right so if more than what's

709
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:23,700
being passed in is is more than a

710
00:30:21,809 --> 00:30:26,360
literal in this case it is right there's

711
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:29,299
an operation there's a new expression

712
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:34,049
you know it changes up the where clause

713
00:30:29,299 --> 00:30:36,150
I can detect that potential exploit at

714
00:30:34,049 --> 00:30:38,070
this point right because I know that

715
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:40,470
there's a massive boundary crossed here

716
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:43,379
where I'm expecting expecting a literal

717
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:46,740
only and I'm now doing some other things

718
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:48,539
that wasn't expected which is what it's

719
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:52,620
trying to do here and comment out that

720
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:54,809
that password block you know so you know

721
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:56,760
just going along those same lines I can

722
00:30:54,809 --> 00:30:58,590
now look at this and be like oh there's

723
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:00,870
multiple things here it's expecting that

724
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:02,879
literal I have an operation you know I

725
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:04,770
have an expression and I have another

726
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,770
comment block that none of that should

727
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:09,779
or was there in the original intent of

728
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:13,139
that query right

729
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:16,200
so with a rasp now I've got this input I

730
00:31:13,139 --> 00:31:19,799
have a result set I analyze that query

731
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:22,109
and I've detected that oh damn it it's

732
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:24,149
crossed a boundary I'm going to do

733
00:31:22,109 --> 00:31:26,699
something based on the action that the

734
00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:30,918
user has set and send an alert somewhere

735
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:34,739
right so the accuracy of that alert is

736
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:37,169
much much greater and better than

737
00:31:34,739 --> 00:31:39,179
something coming from a web and it would

738
00:31:37,169 --> 00:31:41,190
allow me to take action on it whereas

739
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:43,739
some of the alerts from a laugh mate may

740
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:45,359
not really give you any actionable thing

741
00:31:43,739 --> 00:31:47,159
then maybe just blocking an IP address

742
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:49,619
because maybe there's just a bunch of

743
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:52,289
traffic coming in because you're not

744
00:31:49,619 --> 00:31:55,738
sure if it's resulting in anything this

745
00:31:52,289 --> 00:31:57,450
one you can very confidently say that if

746
00:31:55,739 --> 00:32:02,159
I were to let this go it would have been

747
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:04,289
an actual sequel injection exploit so

748
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:06,119
you know what comes down to is it's it's

749
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:08,429
kind of like the continue to security

750
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:10,019
and in your car right like think about

751
00:32:08,429 --> 00:32:12,029
all the instrumentation that are that

752
00:32:10,019 --> 00:32:13,919
are in your your vehicles and airplanes

753
00:32:12,029 --> 00:32:16,409
and things like that today right we're

754
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:18,239
instrumenting everything you know how

755
00:32:16,409 --> 00:32:20,099
many of you have tire pressure gauges in

756
00:32:18,239 --> 00:32:23,129
your vehicles right it gives you that

757
00:32:20,099 --> 00:32:25,918
instant feedback and you know for sure

758
00:32:23,129 --> 00:32:28,109
that crap my tire pressure has just

759
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,639
dropped significantly I probably need to

760
00:32:28,109 --> 00:32:33,119
go get that checked and do something

761
00:32:29,639 --> 00:32:35,369
about it right now right whereas the old

762
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:37,259
approach was you would just kind of you

763
00:32:35,369 --> 00:32:39,928
know get out of your car and notice that

764
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:41,279
that tire might look low or you know

765
00:32:39,929 --> 00:32:42,629
like the laughs approached someone in

766
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,979
the car next to you says roll your

767
00:32:42,629 --> 00:32:47,009
window down and tells you your tires

768
00:32:43,979 --> 00:32:48,629
look right it's it's not the instant

769
00:32:47,009 --> 00:32:51,450
feedback that you would know right now

770
00:32:48,629 --> 00:32:54,809
it's the next kind of person that may

771
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:57,359
look at it and tell you that you know

772
00:32:54,809 --> 00:32:58,649
from from a perspective of you know what

773
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:02,339
it looks like compared to what a laugh

774
00:32:58,649 --> 00:33:03,959
is you know I turned the rule on rain so

775
00:33:02,339 --> 00:33:05,700
I've commanded diction rule across its

776
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,330
request forgery cross-site scripting so

777
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,909
on and so forth

778
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:10,349
I turn it on or turn it off maybe I want

779
00:33:08,909 --> 00:33:11,609
to have it in monitor mode maybe they

780
00:33:10,349 --> 00:33:14,279
want to have it in black mode whatever

781
00:33:11,609 --> 00:33:16,439
it might be but there's not really any

782
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:20,779
extra tuning to go I'm not I'm not

783
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:22,679
making any tweaks you know to the system

784
00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:23,460
at all really

785
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:25,080
when it come

786
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:27,870
down to it it's it's kind of an on or

787
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:30,779
off type of thing however there are

788
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:33,590
still downfalls right and and we would

789
00:33:30,779 --> 00:33:37,020
move me if I didn't talk about them

790
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:40,260
since it is running and instrumenting an

791
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:44,070
application right it's very very

792
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:45,809
language and framework specific so you

793
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:49,049
can imagine the amount of development

794
00:33:45,809 --> 00:33:51,990
effort that's required to support even a

795
00:33:49,049 --> 00:33:54,809
point release version of not only say

796
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:56,760
Java but spring right like we're

797
00:33:54,809 --> 00:33:58,590
supporting Java is one thing may be

798
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:00,600
supporting Java eight to nine or ten or

799
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:03,689
eleven is one thing may be supporting

800
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:06,539
spring four to five is one thing and you

801
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:11,250
start adding complexities to to that

802
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:13,379
sort of support rate any sort of bypass

803
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:14,790
which again you're a specific gonna be

804
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:16,109
perfect there's going to be pipette

805
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:17,940
bypasses and there's gonna be false

806
00:34:16,109 --> 00:34:20,909
positives but hopefully they come in

807
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:25,080
much much much lower rates than your

808
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:26,790
left when they do a lot of times it

809
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:29,279
would result in code changes because

810
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:30,570
remember it's it's it's an agent of some

811
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,190
sort that is instrumenting your

812
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:35,280
application and that agent would need to

813
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:38,418
be possibly updated depending on you

814
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:40,349
know where the fix needed to occur

815
00:34:38,418 --> 00:34:42,750
sometimes it's a lot more difficult to

816
00:34:40,349 --> 00:34:44,790
install you know a lot of times the wife

817
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:47,030
can just be front ended and some nginx

818
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:50,489
or some sort of server on the front end

819
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:52,290
whereas this is running in the the VM of

820
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:54,118
wherever your code is running right so

821
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:57,119
you know if you're Chavez running in

822
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:59,220
what sphere WebLogic context your agent

823
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:01,560
has to be running there alongside it and

824
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:03,990
sometimes that's a little more difficult

825
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:05,609
however and more of the DevOps

826
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:09,839
automated type approaches it works

827
00:35:05,609 --> 00:35:12,089
fairly well and you know another thing

828
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:13,920
that commonly is run into is oftentimes

829
00:35:12,089 --> 00:35:17,520
you don't see anything and you're not

830
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:20,190
sure if it's actually doing any

831
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:23,550
protections because nof we're so used to

832
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:27,270
a plethora of stuff and seeing all these

833
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:29,250
things regardless of you know any

834
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:31,530
actionable items that come out of it

835
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:33,420
we're used to seeing all that stuff so

836
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:34,260
we're so used to it it's like oh I got

837
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:36,930
my rafts gone

838
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:42,300
got it installed it's running

839
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:43,470
and I'm not getting attacked okay and

840
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,750
that's okay all right

841
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:47,598
you shouldn't see nearly as much and

842
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:50,809
actually you should see quite a bit less

843
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:53,730
because remember it has that context of

844
00:35:50,809 --> 00:35:56,640
what it's actually detecting as an

845
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:58,380
attack and a potential exploit you know

846
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:01,348
and the great thing about rasp is you

847
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:05,250
know it's already a standard you know

848
00:36:01,349 --> 00:36:07,109
it's in 853 PCI you know they're talking

849
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:10,020
about adding into some of the you know

850
00:36:07,109 --> 00:36:11,308
Sam and and things like that as well so

851
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:15,960
it's certainly something you know to

852
00:36:11,309 --> 00:36:17,730
think about so let's compare the two

853
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:21,180
outside of just talking about them

854
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:24,119
separately right how are they similar

855
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:27,210
how are they different is there a way to

856
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:28,589
compare them you know I think you

857
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:30,650
probably understand that there's some

858
00:36:28,589 --> 00:36:34,170
differences that kind of went through

859
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:36,569
separately and you can see from this

860
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:39,180
that you know from an architectural

861
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:41,299
standpoint you know this may not look

862
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:44,578
too different but it's it's it's

863
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:46,230
dramatically different you know because

864
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:47,730
the the laugh is kind of front ending

865
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:49,200
things and could be fronting a front

866
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:51,930
ending a lot of different applications

867
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,700
you know could be the only entry point

868
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:56,609
into your network that's front ending

869
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:58,290
your whole entire application space you

870
00:36:56,609 --> 00:37:04,230
know where is the rasp you know it sits

871
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:07,859
on an application so what we're seeing a

872
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:09,540
lot of you know cuz you know where were

873
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:10,920
you know in this space I've been in this

874
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:13,099
space for a while you know I've looked

875
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:15,780
at where ASP and all that is

876
00:37:13,099 --> 00:37:18,150
organizations will try to pick one or

877
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:22,290
the other all right like it's do laugh

878
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:24,569
or a rasp but I'm not sure if that's the

879
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:26,970
right thing to do and let me tell you

880
00:37:24,569 --> 00:37:28,890
why so as you can see the architecture

881
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:30,540
is different right and what I went

882
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:34,109
through already has kind of explained

883
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:36,420
the differences so a lot of the analysis

884
00:37:34,109 --> 00:37:39,750
that organizations are doing for

885
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:41,609
whatever PSA's grasp is they're just

886
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:43,260
taking a bunch of payloads so they maybe

887
00:37:41,609 --> 00:37:46,410
they go download you know some payload

888
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:48,390
generator and they just throw it at

889
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:50,430
these dummy applications those dummy

890
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:51,990
applications may just be an endpoint

891
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:55,770
that's just listening and not doing

892
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:57,509
anything right so now understanding what

893
00:37:55,770 --> 00:38:00,000
a rasp does do you think the rasp is

894
00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:01,410
going to detect anything and I'm hoping

895
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,539
you're all saying well no of course it's

896
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:06,118
not because if doing nothing on the back

897
00:38:03,539 --> 00:38:07,470
end other than just listening it's not

898
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:11,819
going to detect and do anything with

899
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:13,529
that stuff right so you know more more

900
00:38:11,819 --> 00:38:16,410
orgs are starting to do a little bit

901
00:38:13,529 --> 00:38:18,150
better payload type testing but you know

902
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:22,558
one case study that that was kind of

903
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:24,599
done was you know look at sequel

904
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:26,760
injection command injection XSS file pat

905
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:28,890
reversal right some of these things that

906
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:30,869
are the most egregious things that

907
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:33,180
organizations probably care about and

908
00:38:30,869 --> 00:38:34,529
you can see here the scan count that's

909
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:38,308
the different payloads that are being

910
00:38:34,529 --> 00:38:40,770
sent and then Blackcomb so no take a

911
00:38:38,309 --> 00:38:44,059
step back and look at these numbers and

912
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:46,380
digest it look what are these mean I

913
00:38:44,059 --> 00:38:49,650
hope you're saying out mean anything and

914
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:51,960
I agree because one I don't know what

915
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:55,079
the payloads are I have no idea what the

916
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:58,319
payloads are to what what does block

917
00:38:55,079 --> 00:39:00,240
mean does it mean that it detected it

918
00:38:58,319 --> 00:39:02,808
and just blocked it doesn't mean it

919
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:05,160
detected and said it was a probe are you

920
00:39:02,809 --> 00:39:07,500
submitting their request to an actual

921
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:11,339
vulnerable endpoint for that specific

922
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:13,980
vulnerability right so you can you can

923
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:16,170
take a little bit from this but for the

924
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:18,359
most part these results don't really

925
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:21,630
tell me much at all because it's almost

926
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:24,410
like I'm testing two different systems

927
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:26,940
that do frankly two different things

928
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:29,940
and they're protecting at different

929
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:32,150
levels in an architecture right so the

930
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:34,589
results are kind of all over the place

931
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:37,020
and the testing methods really aren't

932
00:39:34,589 --> 00:39:38,400
consistent you know some people like I

933
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:40,109
said they're just throwing it out of

934
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:43,010
back-end that just has you know an open

935
00:39:40,109 --> 00:39:48,538
the web port that's just listening for

936
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:51,029
requests so our internal research team

937
00:39:48,539 --> 00:39:52,410
looked at a bunch of payload tools some

938
00:39:51,029 --> 00:39:54,690
of the more commonly used ones we

939
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:56,848
actually had a customer that said here

940
00:39:54,690 --> 00:40:00,569
here's all of their tools and all of the

941
00:39:56,849 --> 00:40:03,240
payloads that we use to evaluate laughs

942
00:40:00,569 --> 00:40:04,058
and rest not cool so we'll start looking

943
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:07,448
at some of those

944
00:40:04,059 --> 00:40:09,579
and we really really dug in because I

945
00:40:07,449 --> 00:40:11,140
really wanted to understand again I'm a

946
00:40:09,579 --> 00:40:12,430
big data person and I really want to

947
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:15,629
understand what these these payload

948
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:20,649
tools and lists were and what they did

949
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:24,160
and what came up to be is number one a

950
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:26,949
lot of these payloads aren't valid or

951
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:30,009
they're very much duplicated across

952
00:40:26,949 --> 00:40:31,150
payload lists or they're out of date you

953
00:40:30,009 --> 00:40:33,130
know there's some payloads that haven't

954
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:35,259
been touched in years I mean you know

955
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:39,099
there's some some payloads that are from

956
00:40:35,259 --> 00:40:40,319
like Netscape like do we really need to

957
00:40:39,099 --> 00:40:45,189
detect those anymore

958
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:47,680
probably not right so you know with

959
00:40:45,189 --> 00:40:51,160
regard to XSS it was probably the better

960
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:52,899
of all of them probably because XSS may

961
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:55,779
be a little bit easier to quickly

962
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:58,539
determine if an applications vulnerable

963
00:40:55,779 --> 00:41:01,150
to it right but still 20% of the payload

964
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:04,509
list itself was not valid or duplicate

965
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:06,880
so if we go back a slide what if those

966
00:41:04,509 --> 00:41:10,089
scans and those payloads weren't even

967
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:11,729
valid in the first place because I'm

968
00:41:10,089 --> 00:41:14,049
just pulling them out of a payload list

969
00:41:11,729 --> 00:41:15,999
so then you start breaking it down even

970
00:41:14,049 --> 00:41:18,279
more and you look at sequel injection 27

971
00:41:15,999 --> 00:41:20,259
percent of them weren't valid command

972
00:41:18,279 --> 00:41:22,569
injection 48 percent in Pat's reversal

973
00:41:20,259 --> 00:41:25,150
82 percent and most of that was

974
00:41:22,569 --> 00:41:27,219
duplicate duplicates right you know if

975
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:30,999
I'm gonna detect that that slash I'm

976
00:41:27,219 --> 00:41:36,489
probably not slash dot dot slash right

977
00:41:30,999 --> 00:41:39,339
so it's it's disingenuous for both a

978
00:41:36,489 --> 00:41:42,789
laugh and a rasp to just blindly start

979
00:41:39,339 --> 00:41:45,759
throwing payloads and and data at a

980
00:41:42,789 --> 00:41:48,400
back-end you know dummy application or

981
00:41:45,759 --> 00:41:50,109
insecure app and try to compare those

982
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,059
numbers because there's so many things

983
00:41:50,109 --> 00:41:54,038
at play here that aren't really

984
00:41:52,059 --> 00:41:56,739
providing that whole picture of the

985
00:41:54,039 --> 00:42:00,099
strengths and weaknesses of each of them

986
00:41:56,739 --> 00:42:02,559
right so you know I think having that

987
00:42:00,099 --> 00:42:04,749
visibility for your data is important

988
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:07,359
and the way we think about those data

989
00:42:04,749 --> 00:42:11,348
that's that's really coming in and in

990
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:14,709
how we we classify you know the

991
00:42:11,349 --> 00:42:16,420
important data that we're seeing and you

992
00:42:14,709 --> 00:42:17,710
know you look at the the way that we're

993
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:19,450
currently doing it with

994
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:20,950
with our laugh right we have our our

995
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:23,290
SAST and DAST

996
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:24,669
type scanning we have all of those

997
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:26,410
results so we have all of our

998
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:29,559
vulnerability data we have in some

999
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:31,328
tracker or trackers where we're doing in

1000
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:34,210
our sprints we're fixing things there

1001
00:42:31,329 --> 00:42:37,450
and then our applications get get pushed

1002
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:39,069
to prod and as we said before we know

1003
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:41,140
applications are vulnerable right we're

1004
00:42:39,069 --> 00:42:42,819
not fixing everything right now you know

1005
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:45,640
the average mean times and remediation

1006
00:42:42,819 --> 00:42:48,308
you know of applications is you know

1007
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:50,770
significant for the most part you know

1008
00:42:48,309 --> 00:42:53,800
it's over a hundred days industry

1009
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:56,259
average so we know that we're running

1010
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:57,819
vulnerable applications but we don't

1011
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:59,050
have any insight here because all we

1012
00:42:57,819 --> 00:43:00,700
have is our laughs running that's

1013
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:04,180
probably pumping things into our soccer

1014
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:07,359
or simmer or logging mechanism right so

1015
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:09,790
then with rasp we've now able to you

1016
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:11,920
know more closely correlate some of that

1017
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:14,380
data and in help with some actionable

1018
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:16,150
items now is this bad to have this data

1019
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:19,059
heck no like from a threat intelligence

1020
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:21,250
standpoint I still want laughs data I

1021
00:43:19,059 --> 00:43:24,190
still want to know if I've got some

1022
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:27,150
massive DDoS or scan attempt or you know

1023
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:31,030
I'm seeing all sorts of things come from

1024
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:33,460
some some of the container orgs out

1025
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:35,500
there you know for XSS and whatever else

1026
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:38,109
I still want to know that stuff but I

1027
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:40,480
also want to look into my app and I want

1028
00:43:38,109 --> 00:43:43,180
to see what things

1029
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:45,970
I'm actual vulnerable on or have

1030
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:48,540
vulnerable components in and block those

1031
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:50,770
things and it will allow me to not only

1032
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:54,640
know that I have vulnerable applications

1033
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:56,650
but knowingly prioritize fixing of

1034
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:59,859
vulnerabilities still moving them into

1035
00:43:56,650 --> 00:44:01,569
prod right and knowing that they're

1036
00:43:59,859 --> 00:44:03,640
going to be blocked right because I've

1037
00:44:01,569 --> 00:44:06,970
got my rasp running and I'm able to

1038
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:13,328
correlate that data back to you know my

1039
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:17,049
SAS I ask desk type data so one one

1040
00:44:13,329 --> 00:44:18,760
analogy that I kind of like to use here

1041
00:44:17,049 --> 00:44:24,099
and you probably kind of see where I'm

1042
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:26,950
going with this I truly believe that the

1043
00:44:24,099 --> 00:44:29,800
left and the rasp have a place in an

1044
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:34,299
article security tool belt

1045
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:37,330
I think that each one of them has you

1046
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:38,740
know pluses and minuses as far as you

1047
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:41,049
know what what they're good at what

1048
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:45,220
they're not so good at I think they work

1049
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:48,520
extremely well together as well as well

1050
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:51,100
right you know the the laughs is very

1051
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:52,900
noisy you know that that could be

1052
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:55,089
trimmed down to to something where I'm

1053
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:57,310
just correlating for some higher level

1054
00:44:55,090 --> 00:44:59,980
of threat intelligence it requires a lot

1055
00:44:57,310 --> 00:45:02,049
of tuning whereas you know if I have the

1056
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:04,570
laugh and the rasp running maybe I don't

1057
00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:06,580
need to tune it as much because I know

1058
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:09,160
if there's a there's a bypass of some

1059
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:11,410
sort I know that the rasp should detect

1060
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:13,109
it and and catch it so it's kind of like

1061
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:16,120
a you know that whole stacked

1062
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:18,190
methodology of you know having different

1063
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:23,109
layers of security controls at different

1064
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:25,150
places in the ecosystem so you know what

1065
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:27,370
it comes down to is I like to you know

1066
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:30,850
have it it's it's more than an analogy

1067
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:33,730
but you think about AV right and a virus

1068
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:35,560
has been around forever and ever I think

1069
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:37,300
in the security industry for the most

1070
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:40,900
part we complain about it oh it's not

1071
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:43,110
not good enough it doesn't very do a

1072
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:45,730
very good job it's all signature based

1073
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:48,670
you know once you're past it it's game

1074
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:49,780
over and it's been like that forever you

1075
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:54,700
know I think there were quite a few

1076
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:56,560
years there where the the AV space was

1077
00:45:54,700 --> 00:46:00,759
very bloated it got really really

1078
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:02,410
expensive very quickly and it started

1079
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,330
getting to the point where even security

1080
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:07,390
professionals were like we gotta weigh

1081
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:09,549
the cost and the benefit and then people

1082
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:11,859
like Microsoft were like oh here here's

1083
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:14,290
some free AV just go put it on all your

1084
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:16,180
Microsoft machines and and that was

1085
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:17,890
going quote good enough right because it

1086
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:20,169
did the same sorts of things it had

1087
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:22,720
signature based detection it updated

1088
00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:24,610
quite frequently and it still provided

1089
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:28,149
that that not only that check the box

1090
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:29,650
but it was still one control and this

1091
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:33,190
went on for quite four years right then

1092
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:35,290
we moved slowly to the right a little

1093
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:38,740
bit right so we went into more of a

1094
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:42,910
next-gen antivirus there's more advanced

1095
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:45,959
features things got better

1096
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:48,670
it was still mostly signature-based

1097
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:51,160
you know there's not necessarily always

1098
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:52,839
going to be as many updates because it's

1099
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:55,839
still it's doing things a little bit

1100
00:46:52,839 --> 00:46:58,509
differently it helped to close some of

1101
00:46:55,839 --> 00:47:01,299
those gaps that it previously had with

1102
00:46:58,510 --> 00:47:02,770
just your basic mi registry so you're

1103
00:47:01,299 --> 00:47:05,170
starting to see where we're trending

1104
00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:09,430
here right so then we get more into the

1105
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:13,660
right side with EPP and GP and now EDR

1106
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:17,529
right where we have basically

1107
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:21,038
instrumented these endpoints to detect

1108
00:47:17,529 --> 00:47:24,190
and contain security attacks and

1109
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:26,260
incidents we know that someone's

1110
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:29,200
machines now been compromised with some

1111
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:31,779
CNC right we know how to stop it and

1112
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:35,288
prevent it and sandbox it and notify the

1113
00:47:31,779 --> 00:47:40,029
right people with the EDR and this is

1114
00:47:35,289 --> 00:47:45,369
going to be similar from AV akf to EDR

1115
00:47:40,029 --> 00:47:47,740
aka rasp right so that's one way I like

1116
00:47:45,369 --> 00:47:51,089
to look at it you know it's not a

1117
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:54,879
perfect analogy but it does show that

1118
00:47:51,089 --> 00:47:57,670
they are really different technologies

1119
00:47:54,880 --> 00:48:02,079
and what they're doing right now do you

1120
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:03,760
have both AV & EDR some people do is

1121
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:06,490
that the right approach it might be it

1122
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,900
might be the right approach for you I

1123
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:11,430
think it's the right approach with a

1124
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:11,430
wife and her ass so

1125
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:23,859
the one thing that really gets to me

1126
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:26,860
about security in general is is MTTR and

1127
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:31,360
how quickly we can get things fixed and

1128
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:33,370
patched and all that so you know was it

1129
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:34,780
five years ago maybe maybe not that long

1130
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:38,380
ago we started talking about this whole

1131
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:40,630
shift left momentum you know move things

1132
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:42,880
as far left as possible let's talk about

1133
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:45,610
them as early as possible you know let's

1134
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:47,530
get integrated IDs and all that's great

1135
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:54,100
and and I think it's it's allowed us to

1136
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:56,590
make strides and not producing the same

1137
00:48:54,100 --> 00:49:00,160
amount of unsecure software as we used

1138
00:48:56,590 --> 00:49:03,580
to but it also only works well in the

1139
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:05,109
DevOps and agile type environments and

1140
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:08,380
there's still frankly there's still a

1141
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:11,880
lot of more of the antiquated waterfall

1142
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:15,160
approach it's tried and true it works

1143
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:18,100
and that's what some people are used to

1144
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:22,210
and sometimes change is hard and speed

1145
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:23,710
is sometimes the enemy right so the the

1146
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:27,160
whole shift left movement didn't

1147
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:34,150
necessarily work as well for everyone

1148
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:38,980
and so hackers exploit this leg right so

1149
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:43,780
you look at the CB 2017 56:38 it was an

1150
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:48,130
Apache struts issue this is what Equifax

1151
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:51,160
was breached on right so you know a CVE

1152
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:54,550
was issued on March 7th and for the

1153
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:58,660
longest time you know for that for that

1154
00:49:54,550 --> 00:50:01,240
first day we started detecting attacks

1155
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:02,799
and probes and stuff for this specific

1156
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:05,049
attack you know there were proof of

1157
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:08,320
concepts it was something that was

1158
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:12,220
clinically easily exploited and then

1159
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:14,680
there were like no updates you know and

1160
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:16,450
then mid-may so you're talking you know

1161
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:19,180
a month and a half two months and a half

1162
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:24,430
months right no updates no detection

1163
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:26,950
breach occurs that breach resulted in

1164
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:29,109
the compromise of lots and lots and lots

1165
00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:34,509
of accounts

1166
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:37,300
and then July 29th which was many many

1167
00:50:34,510 --> 00:50:42,040
months later is when an Equifax learned

1168
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:45,580
about it right and then September 7th is

1169
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:47,830
when they disclosed it so you look at

1170
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:50,200
that timeline right and you start to say

1171
00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:52,410
to yourself the shift left movement

1172
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:57,609
wouldn't have necessarily fixed this

1173
00:50:52,410 --> 00:51:00,120
right a CVE is released there's probably

1174
00:50:57,610 --> 00:51:05,280
a fix right apache fixed that version

1175
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:07,569
but now I've got to go and update that

1176
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:09,310
complications server that web server and

1177
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:10,900
I got to make sure update all the ones

1178
00:51:09,310 --> 00:51:12,490
that are vulnerable and there could be

1179
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:13,630
hundreds there could be thousands in my

1180
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:16,149
environment depending on what the

1181
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:17,070
environment looks like and if I don't do

1182
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:19,780
it right now

1183
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:20,550
attackers have that time to now exploit

1184
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:25,510
that way

1185
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:29,560
so we've traditionally used a wife to

1186
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:33,700
help bridge that gap right but some of

1187
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:36,670
these CDs lots of them are you know yell

1188
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:40,390
injection or deserialization with our

1189
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:45,280
CEO remote code execution aren't easily

1190
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:48,009
detected by of' because they need the

1191
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:50,830
signature to detect the maybe the

1192
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:53,530
serialized version of something right so

1193
00:51:50,830 --> 00:51:56,230
then we're reliant on the laughs to go

1194
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:59,430
and make some patch or someone to go to

1195
00:51:56,230 --> 00:52:02,530
their laughs and create their own patch

1196
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:08,049
to prevent this attack from occurring

1197
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:12,880
while they get their servers updated but

1198
00:52:08,050 --> 00:52:15,360
if I had a laugh and a rasp a rasp is

1199
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:19,330
really good at some of those more

1200
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:22,570
esoteric not necessarily signature-based

1201
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:25,480
type of attacks and exploits right your

1202
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:28,300
deserialization stuff your eel injection

1203
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:30,460
stuff maybe some of your XSS and pet

1204
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:32,410
reversal depending on bypasses and

1205
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:33,850
things like that it's really good at

1206
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:36,190
detecting those because it can do it in

1207
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:38,560
a way where tokenize is that input and

1208
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:42,130
it can detect the boundary crossing and

1209
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:45,220
and really prevent those things so

1210
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:46,990
I can utilize the control system here

1211
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:49,118
and know that I have my laughs and I

1212
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:50,649
have time to patch that know that I have

1213
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:52,869
my servers and that there's a patch out

1214
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:55,900
and I have time to patch those because I

1215
00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:58,660
have my rasp learning right so having

1216
00:52:55,900 --> 00:53:00,609
all of those is important because it

1217
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:05,799
provides us that layered approach to

1218
00:53:00,609 --> 00:53:08,859
security which we're all used to so you

1219
00:53:05,799 --> 00:53:10,538
know what it comes down to is you know

1220
00:53:08,859 --> 00:53:12,220
normally if I was sitting in front of

1221
00:53:10,539 --> 00:53:16,980
you I'd be like all right who here would

1222
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:20,200
rather have an airbag or a seatbelt and

1223
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:23,380
I'm sure both of you or you know however

1224
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:25,180
many of your listening are like oh why

1225
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:25,450
do I have to choose and that's exactly

1226
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:27,578
right

1227
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:31,058
why do I have to choose why can't I have

1228
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:34,359
both you know sure the seatbelt might be

1229
00:53:31,059 --> 00:53:36,130
annoying right because you might break a

1230
00:53:34,359 --> 00:53:39,369
little too hard once and then it gets

1231
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:41,769
kind of stuck or whatever right you know

1232
00:53:39,369 --> 00:53:44,529
or rubs wrong for long driving and

1233
00:53:41,769 --> 00:53:46,089
things like that you know but you always

1234
00:53:44,529 --> 00:53:49,269
feel it you're always getting those

1235
00:53:46,089 --> 00:53:51,849
quote unquote alerts but the airbag the

1236
00:53:49,269 --> 00:53:53,049
airbag really say to you when it needs

1237
00:53:51,849 --> 00:53:55,359
to right

1238
00:53:53,049 --> 00:53:58,390
when you run into something when you hit

1239
00:53:55,359 --> 00:54:00,430
a truck and or get hit by someone that's

1240
00:53:58,390 --> 00:54:02,319
one of the text it and it deploys it and

1241
00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:05,799
it protects you that way

1242
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:07,900
so it's prevention and protection which

1243
00:54:05,799 --> 00:54:10,000
is it's very similar to what what I

1244
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:12,579
think with laugh and rasp would work

1245
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:15,039
well and in our environments and I'll

1246
00:54:12,579 --> 00:54:16,240
leave you with this you know like I said

1247
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:20,380
before I think the strengths and

1248
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:24,308
weaknesses of both of them really work

1249
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:28,119
well together right and allows us to

1250
00:54:24,309 --> 00:54:31,269
help bridge the gap of vulnerabilities

1251
00:54:28,119 --> 00:54:34,809
and CVEs and things that come out that

1252
00:54:31,269 --> 00:54:37,209
we may not have the time or can't get to

1253
00:54:34,809 --> 00:54:40,509
it as quickly as maybe the malicious

1254
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:42,390
actors can right both of them have

1255
00:54:40,509 --> 00:54:44,470
strengths both of them have weaknesses

1256
00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:46,990
and we've talked about all those at

1257
00:54:44,470 --> 00:54:49,328
length and and I hope you can see that

1258
00:54:46,990 --> 00:54:51,069
you know in the security space we

1259
00:54:49,329 --> 00:54:55,000
continually talk about control layers

1260
00:54:51,069 --> 00:54:55,730
and I believe extending right not just

1261
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,470
shifting left

1262
00:54:55,730 --> 00:54:58,790
is definitely something that we have to

1263
00:54:57,470 --> 00:55:01,308
continue down this path we're

1264
00:54:58,790 --> 00:55:06,259
instrumenting everything else let's do

1265
00:55:01,309 --> 00:55:08,329
it and continue doing it in Prague and I

1266
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:14,140
thank you I don't know if there's any

1267
00:55:08,329 --> 00:55:14,140
questions let's see

1268
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,680
you
