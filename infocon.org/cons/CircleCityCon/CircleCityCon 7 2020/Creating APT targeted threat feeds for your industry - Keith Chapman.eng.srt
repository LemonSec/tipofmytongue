1
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:16,980
okay first of all thank you for the

2
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,930
opportunity my name's Keith Chapman and

3
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,090
I'm working a security operations center

4
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,430
as a senior secure cyber security

5
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,410
analyst I'll you the threat intelligence

6
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,359
efforts on our team and I've been in

7
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,630
cyber security for over five years

8
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,669
I have EC counsels certified threat

9
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,309
intelligence analyst certification and

10
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:38,218
I've been exploring ways to be more

11
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:45,870
proactive in defense and detection these

12
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:47,789
are some of the ideas my goal with this

13
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,500
talk is to share a method of getting

14
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:51,000
more context from threat feeds and they

15
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,739
use them in a way that enriches was

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,780
important to you previously we imported

17
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:00,288
unfiltered threat feeds into our sim

18
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:04,379
environment and it was a big time waster

19
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:06,479
so I proposed a targeted approach it

20
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:09,360
created a heat map that gave priority to

21
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,810
the top adventurous advanced persistent

22
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,250
threat groups that target our industry

23
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:16,110
this allowed us to create a weighted

24
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,759
intelligence feeds of high value such as

25
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,729
tactics techniques and procedures that

26
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,710
align with the mitre attack tags the

27
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:24,570
indicators are compromised that were

28
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:27,210
provided enriched alert data and

29
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:30,470
produced far fewer false positives at

30
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:33,809
times more than six hundred percent

31
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:36,509
disclaimer this is a reference design

32
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:44,610
and I've made changes so that belkin's

33
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:47,310
security stack is obfuscated imagine

34
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:50,430
this idea like a pizza what am i

35
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:53,060
defending like a pizza the ingredients

36
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:55,439
that you want can be custom selected a

37
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:58,530
layered intelligence is built for a

38
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,570
purpose defense working together the

39
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,829
whole is greater than the parts so some

40
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,199
of the parts that we use were

41
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:05,699
environmental intelligence that

42
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:10,199
connected all the other intelligences

43
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:11,940
together curated threat feeds will one

44
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,739
community that enrich detection and

45
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:23,100
proactive intelligence that gave

46
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:25,710
targeted and actionable defense so what

47
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:29,220
is an advanced advanced persistent

48
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:32,010
threat an apt or advanced persistent

49
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:34,859
threat it's a stealthy computer network

50
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:36,450
threat actor typically a nation state or

51
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,490
state-sponsored group which gains

52
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,890
unauthorized access to a computer

53
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:43,980
network and remains undetected for

54
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:46,410
extended period such threat actors

55
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:50,549
motivations are typically political or

56
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:52,500
economic it may also refer to a non

57
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,540
state-sponsored group conducting a

58
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,720
large-scale targeted intrusions for

59
00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:00,299
specific goals and every major business

60
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:03,260
sector has recorded instances of attacks

61
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:06,870
by advanced actors for specific goals

62
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:09,870
seeking to steal spire disrupt the

63
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:12,960
median dwell time the time that a PT tak

64
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:17,070
goes undetected difference widely

65
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:21,200
between regions by RI reports at the

66
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:27,420
mean dwell time for 2018 in Americas is

67
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:33,149
71 days these are some of the groups

68
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:41,489
that we looked at apt 18 apt 38 deep

69
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:42,990
panda apt 41 and fancy bear i elect this

70
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:46,380
naming convention man this is the one a

71
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:51,870
CrowdStrike uses they use spider for a

72
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:55,530
crime kolima for north korea jackal for

73
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:59,220

bear for Russian Federation crane South

77
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:07,459
Korea Buffalo Vietnam

78
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:24,849
so what is attack mitre attack in a

79
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:26,020
knowledge space of adversary tactics and

80
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:29,410
techniques based on real-world

81
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:31,659
observations tactics are what attackers

82
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:34,470
are trying to achieve and a technique is

83
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:37,480
a specific behavior to achieve a goal

84
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:41,950
it's often a single step and a string of

85
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:44,440
activities this can be utilized as a

86
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:46,510
foundation for development of specific

87
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,860
threat models and methodologies to

88
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:50,380
detect and defend against cyber

89
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,270
adversaries in the attack website

90
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:55,330
provides many details about each

91
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:57,940
technique including description examples

92
00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:05,919
references and suggestions for

93
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:08,080
mitigation or detection these are the

94
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:11,440
techniques that the apt 19 group is

95
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,630
known to employ techniques and tactics

96
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:25,210
tend to be slow to change and relatively

97
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:27,690
stable so apt 19 and the Chinese based

98
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:31,570
threat group and they've targeted

99
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:34,050
defense finance energy from suitable

100
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:38,950
telecommunications high tech education

101
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:40,450
manufacturing legal services maite

102
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:43,409
provides background on all the tread

103
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:45,640
actors it lists associated groups

104
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:48,310
typical target industries and other

105
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,659
descriptors they also go by cadeau so

106
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:53,490
that'll sue

107
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:53,490
the bus'll team and some shop group

108
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:05,860
a partial list of techniques that

109
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:07,600
there's apt group uses and this is a

110
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:09,130
detailed description to drive by a

111
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,030
compromise technique that they're known

112
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:15,730
to deploy this is when an adversary may

113
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:18,729
gain access to a system through a user

114
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:20,950
visiting a website it could be a

115
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:23,170
legitimate website that's compromised

116
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:25,360
it could be malicious ads that are

117
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:29,140
served through a legitimate ad provider

118
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:31,810
and it could be a built in web

119
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:33,940
application for something like forum

120
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:37,540
post or comments or other user

121
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:39,580
controllable web content often the

122
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:41,590
website use what adversary is one

123
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:44,650
visited by a specific community such as

124
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:47,289
government particular industry or region

125
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:49,630
and the goal is to compromise specific

126
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:52,570
user or set of users based on a shared

127
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:54,760
interest this kind of targeted attack is

128
00:06:52,570 --> 00:07:00,040
also referred to as a watering hole

129
00:06:54,760 --> 00:07:03,010
attack these are mitigations that can be

130
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:05,230
used to stop this technique techniques

131
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:07,360
are not inherently malicious but can be

132
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:13,030
used by bad actors many are normal

133
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:15,820
processes or actions you can restrict

134
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:18,969
web-based content you can keep your

135
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:22,980
software up-to-date you can use

136
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:22,980
application isolation in sandbox in

137
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:30,969
finally might also provides guidance and

138
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,310
how malicious application of technique

139
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:35,860
might be detected I'll be revisiting

140
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:41,110
slip revisiting this later what this

141
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:46,680
technique firewalls and proxies or mid

142
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:46,680
systems can be used to detect

143
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:54,400
so the first step was to select the apt

144
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:59,189
groups at target your industry

145
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:01,748
I chose financial defense

146
00:07:59,189 --> 00:08:05,499
nongovernmental organizations health

147
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:08,340
care education aviation energy retail

148
00:08:05,499 --> 00:08:12,490
and technology to do a proof-of-concept

149
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:20,739
this Excel spreadsheet shows what apt

150
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:22,629
groups are targeting each sector this

151
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:25,629
chart shows a number of apt groups

152
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:27,099
targeting each industry financial and

153
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:36,279
defense sort of two most heavily

154
00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:38,799
targeted in my research this was the

155
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:40,659
initial visualization that I made this

156
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:43,328
highlights the techniques of apt groups

157
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:46,630
at target defense mitre makes it very

158
00:08:43,328 --> 00:08:48,819
easy to visualize this data this process

159
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:50,589
is time consuming and I would recommend

160
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:56,890
working on a technique at a time and

161
00:08:50,589 --> 00:09:00,100
documenting as you go so this is a

162
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:03,060
process that I used I'll go into more

163
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,060
detail about this later

164
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:19,660
identifying apt actions at this portion

165
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:22,190
of the chart gives you the biggest win

166
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:23,839
group stop at this stage haven't been

167
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:30,980
able to maintain persistence or

168
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:33,460
exfiltrate data the darker the color is

169
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:37,130
on the chart the more apt groups

170
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:38,720
employed a technique the next few slides

171
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:42,500
show how different techniques are used

172
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,630
for different industries what drove this

173
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,100
idea is that I wanted to focus in on the

174
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:48,529
potential dress that can make the most

175
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,510
impact on the industry we are smaller

176
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:51,200
team and we have to maximize our

177
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:54,140
resources

178
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:58,670
what aviation faces is very different

179
00:09:54,140 --> 00:10:01,720
than apt groups targeting retail this

180
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:04,189
chart also highlights sub techniques

181
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:06,140
Mathers released sub techniques in beta

182
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:13,730
form to provide more ways to identify

183
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:16,520
bad actors these are the techniques of

184
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:18,470
apt groups targeting healthcare these

185
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,089
visualizations are useful communicating

186
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:22,370
the risk of controls to others in your

187
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:23,720
organization and now that you have all

188
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:25,640
of this you can use a threat

189
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,310
intelligence platform to create custom

190
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,960
prioritized threat feeds this weekend

191
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:32,260
other presenters have demonstrated how

192
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:35,839
these techniques can be detected and

193
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:41,060
tested please check out the other threat

194
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:45,280
intelligence talks retail and healthcare

195
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:47,869
have more overlaps for both industries

196
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:49,610
initially compromising ballot accounts

197
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:59,380
is the most likely attack vector that

198
00:10:49,610 --> 00:11:01,120
can be employed by apt groups so of

199
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:03,070
the count attack this is when

200
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,020
adversaries may obtain and abuse

201
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:07,410
credentials of existing accounts as a

202
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:09,970
means of gaining initial access

203
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:13,630
persistence privilege escalation or

204
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:16,330
defense evasion the adversaries may

205
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:19,870
choose not to use malware or tools of

206
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:23,100
conjunction with a legitimate access to

207
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:23,100
make it harder to detect their presence

208
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:29,830
dealer will Africa missions for local

209
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:33,220
domain and cloud accounts across a

210
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:34,960
network of systems is a concern because

211
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:39,190
the adversary may be able to pivot

212
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:49,270
across accounts to reach a high level of

213
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:52,240
access and these mitigations are for

214
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:56,579
this particular type of attack password

215
00:11:52,240 --> 00:12:00,460
policies privileged access management or

216
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:03,220
application developer guidance so what

217
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:05,080
happens if you find these i/o sees in

218
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:07,510
your environment you can share with

219
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:12,310
others this is where the threat

220
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:15,670
intelligence platform is key what is a

221
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:18,550
threat intelligence platform it can also

222
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:21,699
be abbreviated tip it facilitates the

223
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:23,650
collection of aggregation correlation of

224
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:26,920
threat data from multiple sources in

225
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:28,329
real time this helps an illicit in a

226
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,120
fight threats that are relevant to the

227
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:32,590
organization

228
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:35,010
traditionally sharing threat data is a

229
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:38,020
manual process either through email

230
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:41,110
spreadsheets or ticketing portal this

231
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:44,410
approach does not scale however the use

232
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:46,270
of API Serapis allow for automation of

233
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:51,160
actions without the direct user

234
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:52,810
involvement a tip makes it easier to

235
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,270
share in threat intelligence with other

236
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:56,949
stakeholders and the data that's

237
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:59,199
collected can be used to enrich and

238
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:05,050
contextualize other alerts in security

interest in this example we're using the

259
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:20,468
apt tag after finding the apt tag events

260
00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:26,108
can be further filtered or viewed in

271
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:58,118
download it for review each event can be

272
00:14:56,499 --> 00:15:02,109
exported in a variety of formats

273
00:14:58,119 --> 00:15:06,449
including CSV Stix JSON or as rules for

274
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:06,449
IDF solutions such as store or Sorocaba

275
00:15:06,869 --> 00:15:12,549
this event includes additional moderate

276
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:14,379
Act tax besides T 1193 it can give a

277
00:15:12,549 --> 00:15:17,949
security analyst additional indicators

278
00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:19,449
are compromised to be aware of it also

279
00:15:17,949 --> 00:15:21,459
included a white paper that can be

280
00:15:19,449 --> 00:15:23,139
downloaded to learn more about supply

281
00:15:21,459 --> 00:15:26,159
chain attacks including detection

282
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:26,159
methods and mitigations

283
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,760
miss can be used to handle threat

284
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:34,640
intelligence from a variety of sources

285
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:36,110
not just threat feats but intelligence

286
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:42,800
information can be shared from ice-axe

287
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:44,720
email or manual updates these target

288
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,490
misfeeds can be automated to enrich

289
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,760
other security tools in your enterprise

290
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:52,550
with a curl command the automation

291
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:54,110
component is built directly into Miss it

292
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:58,180
walks you through step-by-step of how

293
00:15:54,110 --> 00:16:01,070
you set it up using a rest client and

294
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:07,520
the query builder custom fees can be

295
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:09,200
generated and shared this Kroll script

296
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,480
will automate the publishing of a feed

297
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:20,060
that includes the apt tag this can be

298
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:23,589
running your seam or data Lake and this

299
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:26,779
is a sample output of the apt export

300
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:29,779
this is fed into elastic stack and we

301
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:34,000
pushed out two firewalls or a B or other

302
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:34,000
security tools it can update as needed

303
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:52,219
so how can this be scaled and how does

304
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:54,200
it fit into an existing environment this

305
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:56,779
is one way this is still a work in

306
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:59,720
progress it's been tested in the lab a

307
00:16:56,779 --> 00:17:01,970
non production environment and we are

308
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,920
feeding Alaska stock atomic or target

309
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:09,650
indicators for the purposes of

310
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:11,839
enrichment or seeking to make this

311
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:13,459
information collaborative and our goal

312
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,470
is to get more context from threat fees

313
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:19,939
and to use them in a way that enriches

314
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:23,270
what's important to you so it starts off

315
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:26,059
with collecting your log sources feeding

316
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:30,040
into lastest ash lastik search and log

317
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:34,580
stash they can be visualized in kibana a

318
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:36,950
hive cortex and miss work together to

319
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:38,490
enrich and to manage cases and analyze

320
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:40,920
observables

321
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:45,200
and Sigma can be used to allow you to

322
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:47,070
share signatures and a non-bender format

323
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:57,179
which you can collaborate with the

324
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:59,010
community this is one slice of the

325
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:01,679
cybersecurity piece so that I showed you

326
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:04,320
to beginning the presentation this is an

327
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,300
exploration of fusion analysis taking

328
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,919
intelligence from multiple sources and

329
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:17,909
bringing them together to create

330
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:19,980
something greater so with environmental

331
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:22,170
intelligence we're looking for high

332
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,970
value log sources that are chosen for

333
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:27,690
the visibility and relevance to use

334
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:29,970
cases machine learning can be leveraged

335
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:34,950
to produce alerts based on anomalous

336
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:36,179
behavior so the idea is that you

337
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:37,860
leverage your systems to give you

338
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:40,710
visibility or what's important to you in

339
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:43,649
this model we're most concerned with log

340
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:52,740
sources that River that best reveal apt

341
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:54,090
activity curated intelligence that's

342
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,860
community shared intelligence that's

343
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:57,780
collected and curated to enrich to

344
00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:02,040
security stack with leading indicators

345
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:11,160
of compromised to give an added context

346
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:13,159
to attacks with the hive it manages

347
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:16,260
cases we use for threat hunting

348
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:20,040
investigations and it has custom Python

349
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:21,840
models that can be utilized as well this

350
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,100
chart shows how this can be positioned

351
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,830
which in your environment from a

352
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:28,919
high-level the adjusted feeds are being

353
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:30,830
sorted by tags related to apt groups Mis

354
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:33,170
just integrated with the cortex and hive

355
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:35,340
for enrichment and case management

356
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:37,110
signatures are rewritten with Sigma so

357
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:40,250
they can be shared with ice ax letter

358
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:40,250
teams in AB in a neutral manner

359
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:49,940
Oh last component is proactive

360
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:53,060
intelligence its counterintelligence is

361
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:56,840
real-time active defense makes attacks

362
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:59,300
more difficult for attackers and this

363
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:05,780
one we're using thinks canary tokens and

364
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:08,389
they can emulate any of these items we

365
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:12,290
don't have to emulate entire systems we

366
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:16,340
can emulate just a email address or a

367
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:18,860
document that would give us the most

368
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:20,300
context of all because it shows where

369
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:23,179
attackers are actually doing any

370
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:25,010
environment by using active defense the

371
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,690
cyber reception we're trying to slow

372
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:34,550
them down while learning as much as we

373
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:37,670
can about them safely if you're not

374
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:39,530
using a tip miss the malware information

375
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:41,960
sharing platform and threat sharing is a

376
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:44,530
great place to start use it in

377
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:46,940
combination with mitre attack framework

378
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:58,010
there are great communities for both and

379
00:20:46,940 --> 00:21:05,870
they are widely adopted so in conclusion

380
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:10,720
I would say research your industry make

381
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:10,719
a heatmap and consider each technique

382
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:25,189
these are all the steps that I took to

383
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:26,480
create the target threat feeds and I

384
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:32,780
will make the slides available water

385
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:35,830
presentation and again this is what it

386
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:35,830
looks like all together

387
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:47,559
my slides will be available at this

388
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:49,270
github or you can contact me if you have

389
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:52,059
any questions or if you have ideas of

390
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:54,510
how to make the workflow better thank

391
00:21:52,059 --> 00:21:54,510
you for your time
