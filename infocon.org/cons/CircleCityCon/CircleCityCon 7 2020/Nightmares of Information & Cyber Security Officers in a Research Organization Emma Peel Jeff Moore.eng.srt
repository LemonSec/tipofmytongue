1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,399
on twitter so um two things about

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:08,799
ourselves so so uh i'm known

3
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:11,440
quite often in both the professional and

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,280
chat circuit as the depth level cso

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,040
and i'm a huge gamer and normally

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,400
without a definite t-shirt

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,038
this is true and then i've been 15 years

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,400
within

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:24,080
itunes security i'm also circus artist

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,038
and gamer which pretty much means i do

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,000
crazy stuff

12
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,640
um in the air for aerial circuits art

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,159
all right

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:35,040
so this talk was spawned

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,718
or conceptualized by you i guess yeah um

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,280
i got asked a lot of questions about

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,879
what exactly keeps me awake at night uh

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,079
where are all of the problems in the

19
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,960
whole universe

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,320
and how could a cso fix everybody's life

21
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,600
the universe and everything

22
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,680
to where i answered i have no clue

23
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,079
so we kind of had a conversation about

24
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,399
this and we brainstormed and put

25
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,600
a presentation on this specifically with

26
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,840
our experience within

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,079
life sciences and scientific

28
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,040
organizations particularly

29
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,519
um so i guess we kind of just formulated

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,200
it down

31
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,760
stilled it down to main topics right

32
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,320
yeah and what we try to do is just look

33
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,640
at

34
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,000
actually within these organizations uh

35
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,840
and also a lot of our peers

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,159
have helped us add some of the stuff

37
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,520
here is exactly what

38
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,840
does drive the people and

39
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,640
us to actually have big huge security

40
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,119
issues

41
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,280
uh and you know first thing like

42
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,640
everything in a research organization

43
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,200
and depending in especially in life

44
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,880
science everybody is trying to cure

45
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,640
cancer and do something great

46
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,920
and that leads to good intentions you

47
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,840
know and

48
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,600
the good intention of bringing a new

49
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,880
application and not to links about it

50
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,559
that is totally vulnerable

51
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,920
doesn't help us and again so good

52
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,680
intentions would be a

53
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,920
big one again you have to understand the

54
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,360
mindset of using scientific research and

55
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,880
we're going to get into that

56
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,799
um another one is typically ignorance oh

57
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,280
no it's fine i want it's good we're all

58
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,799
fine

59
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,640
um again you also need to look into

60
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,920
their population set with an

61
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,239
organization right and

62
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,399
we're going to kind of get into this and

63
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,760
these are individuals who are

64
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,440
as i called it highly intelligent cats

65
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,879
um and then you have other constraints

66
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,440
like regulations

67
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,560
management budgets and all of these

68
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,800
together

69
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,879
is what gives csos out there

70
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,239
particularly in life sciences

71
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,920
um a lot of nightmares yeah and it's

72
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,480
interesting because good intentions

73
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,958
also comes very closely with ignorance

74
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,440
right

75
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,400
so it's been it's been challenging for

76
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,160
all of us

77
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,160
in in the ways but you know especially

78
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,239
now with the current uh pandemic and all

79
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,840
that stuff budget and management

80
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,280
and then at later date regulations are

81
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,319
going to come back people have forgotten

82
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,879
about that

83
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,480
so what is this highly intelligent cat

84
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,280
right so the way

85
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,238
that i categorize it and again this kind

86
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,080
of comes back from more of the

87
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,480
regulation compliance side of me

88
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,760
i like to define terms and these are

89
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,119
individuals who are

90
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,840
highly trained within a stem or steam

91
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,879
field whatever you want to call it

92
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,239
first to solve very complicated

93
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,560
problems right curing diseases

94
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,000
determining satellite trajectories doing

95
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,400
stuff in space

96
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,519
like a lot of these individuals have

97
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,879
spent pretty much

98
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:26,799
their career training learning

99
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:30,079
to solve very complex situations

100
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,040
um and they have some characteristics

101
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,840
yeah you're not going to find these

102
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,920
characteristics in any books by uh by uh

103
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,959
you know uh joe navarro around this

104
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,200
because this is

105
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,200
our characters they saw our experience

106
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,399
in in these fields and

107
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,640
just to give you a quick thing on these

108
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,480
fields the field is both uh

109
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:51,040
life sciences and spacecraft operations

110
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,879
um so these are highly motivated

111
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,840
individuals within your organization

112
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,560
they will do whatever they deem

113
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,000
necessary

114
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,159
to solve a problem or to not be blocked

115
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,480
towards a problem they learn things very

116
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,359
quickly so don't be surprised that a lot

117
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,439
of your

118
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:12,640
users are also multi-phd owners who

119
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:15,439
code and insert a language here right

120
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,599
um and if you are if they are given a

121
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,599
constraint they will think outside the

122
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,440
box they will find a way around it

123
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,280
because that is what you have been

124
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,120
trained and you have gone to university

125
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,359
and got all multiple phds

126
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,960
to do because that's what you're doing

127
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,639
ultimately to solve these complicated

128
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,638
problems

129
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,720
and then if all of this kind of

130
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,160
resonates with everyone

131
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:41,600
hello how are you everyone nice

132
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,479
kitties out there we fall into this

133
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,199
you know pattern and profile and and

134
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,919
most

135
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,720
hackers crackers security researchers

136
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,400
actually do

137
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,000
actually fit very much into the highly

138
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,120
intelligent cats we have a lot of the

139
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,199
same traits

140
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,440
that the scientists or the flight

141
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,680
dynamics crew have

142
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,960
so we quite often have we don't want to

143
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,000
slow ourselves down because research

144
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,719
needs to go forward

145
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,080
security research life sciences research

146
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,320
you know

147
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,199
and so forth all right so we're going to

148
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,120
get a little bit into

149
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,800
again some definitions everyone here

150
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,400
should know what this is but again if

151
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,360
you don't or if you're new or you're

152
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,880
young

153
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,800
i don't know if this actually is taught

154
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,039
within university or not so

155
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,560
we're going to find the cia triad or the

156
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,000
cia principle so

157
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,320
go ahead and there's a reason for it

158
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,520
because you'll see as we go through

159
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,080
these slides

160
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,080
companies look at this completely

161
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,120
completely differently

162
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,120
right so you know as we go through

163
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,280
you'll see why we just quickly wanted to

164
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,080
give a view of this yep so everyone

165
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,400
should know this

166
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,039
one thing to note these are not boolean

167
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,440
values these are spectrums

168
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,440
so in real life again these are not

169
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,240
boolean these are spectrums there's not

170
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,240
a one size fits fall to an organization

171
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,199
when it comes to the cia triad or cia

172
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,000
principle

173
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,560
contrary to what vendors will ever ever

174
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,240
sell you

175
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,479
or whatever you might hear organizations

176
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,479
are the summarization of peoples and

177
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:09,599
processes and people are very

178
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:12,000
complicated um processes again could be

179
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,120
complicated but because of that

180
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,080
every organization is different yeah and

181
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,000
when you go into every organization the

182
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,880
culture is what drives

183
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,520
that organization for success right and

184
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,000
also

185
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,599
understanding that cultural mindset is

186
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,479
what helps you as a security

187
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,600
professional

188
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:33,280
actually be successful because if you

189
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,440
walk into a company and don't quite get

190
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,159
their mindset you don't become part of

191
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,199
that tribe

192
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,120
you'll become the if you are the classic

193
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,880
you know insert framework here and you

194
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,720
get dropped into a company and that is

195
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,719
completely against the nature because

196
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,680
you don't understand the culture

197
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,520
you will not a make friends work out of

198
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,360
the trust of your organization and two

199
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,758
may not be there very long quite frankly

200
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,400
if it's a mature enough organization

201
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,160
and and regulations do have a huge

202
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,520
impact to your view of security it's

203
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,840
it's one of those few things people

204
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,120
think

205
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,400
i know everything and all this stuff and

206
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,039
you walk in all of a sudden the

207
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,638
regulation

208
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,240
actually contradicts some of your

209
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,720
mindset and how you want to put stuff in

210
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,520
there

211
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,199
but you can't go around it right you

212
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,639
know and people and give a good example

213
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,199
is pci says you should encrypt

214
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,280
everything but

215
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,639
in fact if you went and encrypted a

216
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,880
whole sports goods

217
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,680
sporting goods network it's going to be

218
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,280
very expensive

219
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,560
but if you just limped it down to a

220
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,919
small part you know you're in a better

221
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,479
place so if you walk in and be

222
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,400
flexible you know how to go and what you

223
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,919
see to the right here is just you know

224
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,560
again the cia triad

225
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,359
based on a scale of one to six arbitrary

226
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,280
number

227
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,199
and just a general heuristic of the

228
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,080
differences between like a life sciences

229
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,240
organization

230
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,120
big pharma or even a sporting goods

231
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,240
organization

232
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:49,840
how they measure or place

233
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:53,599
value onto each of those facets

234
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:56,080
is different so let's kind of give some

235
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,719
context into understanding the industry

236
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,599
ironically when this talk was first made

237
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,840
in 2000

238
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,520
late 2019 we didn't actually have to

239
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,479
talk about this much or we had to talk

240
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,560
about it

241
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,840
now this is becoming more mainstream

242
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,160
under 2020

243
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,520
and something called i don't know it'll

244
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,919
be 19.

245
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,000
so again you have to understand this

246
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,719
particular industry with life sciences

247
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,919
in general

248
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,319
every single new drug that comes out has

249
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,560
on

250
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,400
average in the united states right

251
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,160
because countries differ

252
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:30,719
on average 15 years of scientific

253
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,240
research behind it and it's very much

254
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,360
like a funnel where you

255
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,560
start with gigantic data sets and drug

256
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,000
discovery

257
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:41,518
and you're honing it down um three

258
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,200
pre-clinical and clinical trials

259
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,440
ultimately to regulatory

260
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,120
approval and then into the market right

261
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,560
and when i say

262
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:54,080
massive amount of data i'm talking order

263
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:57,279
of petabytes year over year

264
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,120
over year um down to

265
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,120
here's the compound if it's you know

266
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,360
compound not a biologic

267
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,320
here is the actual trials that narrows

268
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,600
it but you

269
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,160
have to keep the evidence chain if i

270
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,040
want to talk

271
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,480
ir right through this scientific drug

272
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,399
discovery process

273
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,839
because of those regulatory factors

274
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,320
coming back into play you will have

275
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,880
audit

276
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,640
again talking kind of security show me

277
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,080
the evidence of scientific sound you

278
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,120
know or viability of this drug

279
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,080
right and then you have to keep all that

280
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,200
data for the

281
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,040
life of the drug so

282
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,279
massive amount of data you're coming

283
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,279
into this organization going oh gosh

284
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,080
early drug discovery you have research

285
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,680
scientists who are really big in

286
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:42,880
collaboration

287
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:45,359
and now go solve the world

288
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,920
so here's an example of a scientific

289
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,560
research company

290
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,439
we've worked we worked in them and we

291
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,359
worked in them

292
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,720
also we have a lot of friends in them

293
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,360
the great thing about the highly

294
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,600
intelligent

295
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,440
researcher cat is they love to

296
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,600
collaborate they really do

297
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,040
they are working with universities

298
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,120
institutes

299
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,480
research organizations friends who are

300
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,920
scientists yeah

301
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,560
um very passionate yeah and highly

302
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,319
motivated

303
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,680
yeah you know quite often there's a

304
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,959
personal connection to some of the

305
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,479
research they're doing

306
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,000
so when security comes in and says you

307
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,880
need to stop something you can

308
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,160
think about it's almost like going to to

309
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,360
somebody and saying that but baby is

310
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,240
ugly you know

311
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:29,200
plus they've spent their entire career

312
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,360
typically going for this particular area

313
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,320
right similar with security like you are

314
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,560
a really good ir

315
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,079
guy or you're a really good blue teamer

316
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,279
they have spent their

317
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:41,359
entire area saying i'm going to do

318
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,760
oncology low molecular weight study

319
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,920
on this particular disease area because

320
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,920
they're very passionate about it and and

321
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,560
completely motivated

322
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,000
and credibility credibility is huge and

323
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,839
just like in security and

324
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,519
the interesting thing when you look at

325
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,760
the credibility there is a ton of

326
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,600
scientific research papers out there

327
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,760
all of these life science companies

328
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,399
actually have a really good process to

329
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,279
actually

330
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,040
release paper and you'll see that quite

331
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,920
often in any other company work with

332
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,399
but when you get to to uh to a lot of it

333
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,599
is

334
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,320
these guys collaboration is how research

335
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,839
works and

336
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:20,959
credibility right um so

337
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,720
for you or anyone who's in security

338
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,599
going into a research organization

339
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,399
this credibility is actually key all

340
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,920
right

341
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,920
because you're going into a culture

342
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,319
you're going to bring security controls

343
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,519
in

344
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,040
for better for worse you have these

345
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,519
intelligent cats you need to ultimately

346
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,319
hurt

347
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,279
them um and this believe it or not is

348
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,880
where you need to

349
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:42,399
exploit because to have conversations

350
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,360
with scientists that you go

351
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,680
cia we need to do this for insert reason

352
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,920
and

353
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,479
it's not in the language of them if i

354
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,120
turn them and say you spent your career

355
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,040
doing research into fibromyalgia and i

356
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,639
want to make sure that the integrity of

357
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,240
your research

358
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,360
is sound not only for you know patients

359
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,360
down the line which they're very

360
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,000
motivated and passionate about

361
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,000
but for your own credibility as well

362
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,920
that is the language

363
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,839
that resonates more with your audience

364
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,880
yeah and it's very interesting because

365
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,120
one of the first

366
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,920
interviews i had in a disease area with

367
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,959
a scientist

368
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:23,599
he walked me into a room and and

369
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:25,599
totally drew out a a molecule for me and

370
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,360
literally asked me what is that and he

371
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,800
was literally

372
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,800
that moment trying to see what i knew

373
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,160
and i told him to his face

374
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:37,599
i have no clue what you're talking about

375
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,800
and after a few uh meetings he said well

376
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,079
the reason i asked you about that is

377
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,160
because a that is the

378
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,160
t molecule that you're drinking and b i

379
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,959
wanted to see if you're full of

380
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,000
right which is great being a cso and and

381
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,880
being told that but

382
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,560
honestly these guys know so much and

383
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,399
they want you to they want to see your

384
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,839
credibility are you honest are you open

385
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,680
what are you willing to share

386
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,639
you know and that's how it moves forward

387
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:04,880
and back to that picture we just had

388
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:07,680
uh the the um the integrity

389
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,079
is key for these guys right because if

390
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,239
they're

391
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,199
the integrity of the research they have

392
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,880
they've done

393
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,279
is following the scientific method right

394
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,600
following scientific is has changed

395
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,560
that can either put years of research

396
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,600
down down the tube

397
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:24,479
yeah yeah or

398
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,600
when a paper's reser is released they

399
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,720
lose their credibility and the

400
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,320
credibility of that company

401
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,519
that's why they're peer reviewed right

402
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,200
so that kind of gives you into some of

403
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,720
the mindset now

404
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,839
um unfortunately this video doesn't

405
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,959
actually work for whatever reason

406
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,079
because i was trying to get it to work

407
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:41,199
while you were talking it's not

408
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:43,359
so there's a meme online where is the

409
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:46,479
cat walking through the ever-shrinking

410
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,720
hole of you know a doorway

411
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,240
and if you just apply security controls

412
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,279
on the top of it that's pretty much your

413
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,880
entire life

414
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,639
right so you're going to apply security

415
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,279
controls they're going to find ways

416
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,920
around it

417
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,680
this is why you care you need to be able

418
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,760
to have these conversations

419
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,599
with scientists or users or anyone

420
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,959
within your organization

421
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:10,000
um all right story time so

422
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:11,839
a few years ago we came back into the

423
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,839
office after christmas it was wonderful

424
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,000
we all had wonderful holidays

425
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,920
and and depending on which organization

426
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,079
you're in uh we're lucky that over the

427
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,319
christmas period our company

428
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,439
would shut down most life sciences do

429
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,320
because they have to

430
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,760
overhaul the lab environment yes so you

431
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,760
know we came back in the office

432
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,920
we were looking forward to a slow start

433
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,079
as always and suddenly we saw this huge

434
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,599
uptick on new new traffic going through

435
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,760
the network and it wasn't just

436
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,120
localized to america it was global going

437
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,720
to different locations

438
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,959
different parts of the network and we

439
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,760
look i'm not gonna lie highly confused

440
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,719
so puzzled puzzled is a good word thank

441
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,160
you freshman

442
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:52,320
and after spending a few days

443
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,000
tracking things down and and we started

444
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,120
to see a very

445
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
very clear adversary in our network and

446
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,000
the more we

447
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,440
dug the more we were shaking our heads

448
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,600
because

449
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,880
first it was against our process and

450
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,880
secondly against our policy

451
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,880
and this traffic was not happening

452
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:12,160
happening during the holiday

453
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:15,199
it happened after yeah so and you saw it

454
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,880
increasing each day as more and more

455
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,479
people came back to work

456
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,279
and the funny thing is it was in

457
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,199
different labs different locations

458
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,680
different buildings globally globally

459
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:27,760
and had us a bit confused

460
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,519
so again this is typically where we

461
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,319
would ask the audience if we're there in

462
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,240
person

463
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,600
give us some ideas of what you think it

464
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,519
is right and

465
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,120
unfortunately you know we can't quite do

466
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,519
that so if you want some theories or you

467
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:43,839
want put some guesses down into discord

468
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:47,360
go for it but at the end of the day

469
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:49,279
yeah alexa yeah and people like why do

470
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,519
they actually care about alexa why would

471
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,839
they bring alexa into the organization

472
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,360
there were a lot smaller alexas as well

473
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,440
um

474
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,759
scientists want to also make their life

475
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,680
easier so you're in a controlled lab

476
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,279
you're pped up because say you're

477
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,319
dealing with an infectious disease

478
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:08,079
relevant right yeah um and you go

479
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,800
and you're following a protocol for a

480
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,880
science a research experiment hey alexa

481
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,120
remind me in 20 minutes to take the you

482
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,120
know check the microscope or to take the

483
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,000
lab samples out of you know the cooker

484
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,399
right

485
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,320
it makes sense because they don't have

486
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:25,360
to take off their ppes go

487
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,680
to mark a timer to touch anything or

488
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,680
they can have alexa do a quick research

489
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,680
on particular you know oh give me the

490
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,560
actual molecular weight of insert a

491
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,399
compound

492
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:39,599
name here it makes sense from a business

493
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:42,240
day-to-day lab uh scientist

494
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,360
perspective yeah and honestly you know

495
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,199
we want

496
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,800
we want research to go fast we just

497
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,079
don't want amazon to know everything

498
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,560
we're doing listening to every single

499
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,880
word

500
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,000
so you know it was it was interesting

501
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,480
because

502
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,519
like we said you know it partly it's

503
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,199
ignorance and

504
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,560
secondly you know they assumed good

505
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:01,120
intense yeah good intent

506
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,199
and it did help them we had to stop it

507
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,359
and and we felt bad about it

508
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,720
but you know these people tried really

509
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:09,760
hard to uh

510
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:12,000
make a case yeah make a case yeah um so

511
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,760
that was life sciences so let's kind of

512
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,039
take a look at the late pharmaceutical

513
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,079
organizations right and

514
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:19,839
in pharmaceutical manufacture

515
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,039
in particular it's kind of its own

516
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,240
education because you're dealing a

517
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,160
little bit more with

518
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,000
ot and ics environments so we'll kind of

519
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,000
touch on that as well but

520
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,880
when you're getting into more of a late

521
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,760
phase in human phase 3 trial before

522
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,120
getting out of the market you have to no

523
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,320
regulations you have to know

524
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,959
requirements you have to go

525
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,960
gxp good practice god bless us you have

526
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,760
to have quality documentation

527
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,400
and on top of that you as an infosec

528
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,240
guru

529
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,679
need to keep aware of murders and

530
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,200
acquisitions as well

531
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,720
intellectual property and intellectual

532
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,720
property theft as well as data

533
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,400
classifications and secret projects that

534
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,000
no one within their organization may

535
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,039
need to know about

536
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,640
and it sucks right there there's no

537
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,240
good way to talk to a late-stage

538
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,679
pharmaceutical person to

539
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,720
try to elicit a cultural change there's

540
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,880
no it has to

541
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:15,679
it's fear yeah it is horrible

542
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,440
it is because the availability of the

543
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,960
drug to be available has to be super

544
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,520
high you have to get it out

545
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,200
uh the integrity of the formulation has

546
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,039
to be a hundred percent

547
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,960
um and the confidentiality of the

548
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,559
formula at that point once you kind of

549
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,679
get into ot you're getting a little bit

550
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,080
we'll talk about that

551
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:34,400
um has to be confidential because as

552
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,399
soon as you patent that information

553
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,160
you're now on a ticking time bomb

554
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,400
towards generic land

555
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,840
right and also what's very interesting

556
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,240
here is depending how much money you've

557
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,918
had

558
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,520
actually had to invest into creating

559
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,320
this drug right you actually

560
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:50,320
yeah you actually have two windows right

561
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,039
the window is five or seven years

562
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,399
right and you have exclusivity for the

563
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,240
five or seven years depending how much

564
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,520
money it costs to make that drug so at

565
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,960
the same time

566
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,360
you're making this drug you're releasing

567
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,480
this drug you know that it can be

568
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,120
de-engineered

569
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,880
on one side of it but on the second part

570
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,320
of it we need to constantly make sure it

571
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,120
keeps coming out

572
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,320
now if you look carefully big farmer

573
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,879
care about everything

574
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:17,520
right they care about their recipes they

575
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,720
care about their brand

576
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,600
um a lot like in the in the research

577
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,520
organization

578
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,280
you know confidentiality isn't that

579
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,480
important because to especially to the

580
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,840
scientists because

581
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,160
they haven't patented yet they haven't

582
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,879
patented but secondly they want to talk

583
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,600
about things

584
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,039
and it's really hard for us security

585
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,600
guys to actually know what's secret

586
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,840
because

587
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,799
a scientist may continue working on

588
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,678
something that's

589
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:44,080
amazing that may cure cancer right but

590
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:46,400
nobody tells us about it until he's 100

591
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,840
sure and it's gone through certain

592
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,320
phases of the process

593
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,760
yeah yeah um and so you're asking

594
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,000
yourself why the hell should you care

595
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,320
right

596
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,919
why why do they care why yeah you need

597
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,399
to stay off this list

598
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,000
right so this is a list of uh

599
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,880
contamination incidents with

600
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,799
medical contamination incidences or back

601
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,240
in the 80s or 90s

602
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:10,799
um so there was a very oh

603
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,640
you told us i mean the the whole tylenol

604
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:15,360
case was a very high profile

605
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,240
case right and what happened there is is

606
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,879
every one of the

607
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,000
the pharmaceutical company at

608
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,240
interfarmer

609
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,520
yeah actually has to go back and

610
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,679
validate and prove

611
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,679
it could not have come from them in

612
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,240
their pipe in the complete pipeline

613
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,440
right and it's and literally checking

614
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,559
everything gets turned off

615
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:37,120
stopped and it's it's

616
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,918
it's instant response in a massive scale

617
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,600
at a massive

618
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,039
different kind of scale right and it's

619
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,799
also a different kind of you know you've

620
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,480
got forensics for both

621
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,918
technical forensics to understand was it

622
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,760
was the machine changed

623
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,440
was code change and all this something

624
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,919
also scientific forensics

625
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,840
as well right hence gxps you know good

626
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,679
and sweet pets you have to validate that

627
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,158
the quality guys they're going through a

628
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,640
complete

629
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,520
uh to kind of give you a sense of it if

630
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,280
something within

631
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,760
pharmaceutical or life sciences is a

632
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:07,280
good practice or a gxp qualified system

633
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:09,919
any change to that system

634
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,720
if it's even down to the change the

635
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,640
wallpaper

636
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,480
and if you're doing a clinical study on

637
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,679
that virtual machine

638
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,760
must then be wet inked or pki signed

639
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,919
revalidated that the state of the

640
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:25,120
machine the integrity of the machine

641
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:28,320
is the same because it runs trials right

642
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,520
it is massive so you're asking yourself

643
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,720
you got researchers who are

644
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,799
collaborating they're running around

645
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,840
like crazy you got pharma who's freaking

646
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,280
out all the time

647
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,199
who you know they really care about

648
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,840
their cia classification what are you

649
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,039
doing

650
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,399
right you're cat hurting for a lack of a

651
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,960
better term

652
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,159
your job is to herd cats and this was

653
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,280
back in the 90s

654
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:53,120
um it was a super bowl uh

655
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:55,280
super bowl like half show commercial

656
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,639
where it's the classic western and it's

657
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,559
cats coming over the hill and they're

658
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,600
essentially herding cats at any one

659
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,678
point so

660
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,959
let's give you kind of an example on how

661
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:06,640
to herd

662
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:09,919
cats right so so first off

663
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,120
you need to understand your

664
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,799
your audience coming back to

665
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,840
understanding your audience flower is a

666
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:17,280
group of cats

667
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:19,120
yeah you know understand who you are

668
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,639
who they are and how to interact with

669
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,280
them i mean it's kind of interesting in

670
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,679
the in

671
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,039
in the organization we worked on when

672
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,679
when big pharma would come up with an

673
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:29,600
awareness

674
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:31,120
campaign it wouldn't gel with our cats

675
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,399
our cats would look at it and feel like

676
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,799
they're being talked down to and

677
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,520
culturally speaking

678
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,320
scientists may not necessarily identify

679
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,120
that they're part of a major

680
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,840
pharmaceutical

681
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,039
or say in the space industry like

682
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,199
scientists

683
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:47,280
uh our astrophysicists may not

684
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,960
necessarily agree with working with

685
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:54,000
like a government regulated yeah

686
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,440
um and then instead of that's just

687
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,039
you take those you know once you've

688
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,000
understood them and you kind of

689
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,320
understand you you

690
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,919
exploit those innate characteristics or

691
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,240
utilize if you're business friendly

692
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,720
right so it's truly about

693
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:07,520
confidentiality

694
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,000
um use that for lack of a better term

695
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,039
yeah and

696
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,240
you know they want to to to you know

697
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,480
save the world

698
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,159
and you have to show them that the the

699
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,960
only way they can save the world

700
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,600
is by following some principles of the

701
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:24,640
cia

702
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:27,918
right um don't ever become the enemy

703
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:30,880
right they are stupid smart so

704
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,960
just you know uh explaining or

705
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,360
patronizing or not giving the reasoning

706
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,039
why

707
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,479
assuming that they are less intelligent

708
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,240
than they actually are they

709
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,080
they are super intelligent they may not

710
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,720
have the exact uh

711
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,240
language term set or context space that

712
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,279
you and your career may know

713
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,919
so don't become the enemy and listen a

714
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,840
lot

715
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,440
yeah i mean here's where social

716
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,520
engineering 101 comes to play

717
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,520
listen read and understand right listen

718
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,600
listen to what they're saying

719
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,879
read the body language sometimes you'll

720
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,559
get the understanding that

721
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,240
you're talking and you can see that

722
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,440
they're squirming doesn't mean that

723
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,039
they're doing something wrong and they

724
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,200
just don't understand it

725
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:09,200
and we've seen a lot of times from a lot

726
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,840
of a lot of a lot of these guys

727
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,840
and and and girls is once we've come to

728
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:17,918
a point of discussion the point

729
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:20,000
you've lost them or conversely

730
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:21,360
terms will be overloaded within

731
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,840
scientific realms

732
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,959
versus i.t security or ot security

733
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,039
realms so

734
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,200
again it's a what do you actually mean

735
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:31,120
by target because within information

736
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,559
security it means something completely

737
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,918
different than say a chemist

738
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,639
yeah um and don't be afraid to ask that

739
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,840
question

740
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,760
or ask the question de-acronym it right

741
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,918
because it means that you're listening

742
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,158
to them and you want to understand them

743
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,440
and you'll start building respect yeah

744
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,799
and it's kind of funny because i was

745
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,080
having a long discussion with a couple

746
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,639
of them and they started talking about

747
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,918
atp and i thought atp was a advanced

748
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,880
threat protection they were actually

749
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,440
talking about

750
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,480
a molecule a molecule and i'm totally

751
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,760
thinking they're getting what i'm on

752
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,039
about but actually we were in a

753
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,200
different universe

754
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,240
and if you do this so how do you deal

755
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,159
with management

756
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,360
right like you're doing all this you're

757
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,520
listening

758
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,918
the phrasing that you're actually using

759
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,200
for upper echelons of management

760
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,960
is that you're actually building a

761
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,640
company-wide security culture so this

762
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,400
kind of gives you the overall

763
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,000
cover to do this and like this is how

764
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,480
we're affecting change

765
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,760
um within an organization and this is

766
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,799
what we're actually doing you know

767
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:30,240
security by resign privacy by design

768
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:32,879
uh culture starts here yeah

769
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,640
and it's when you as you work through

770
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,279
and and you start building credibility

771
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,120
within

772
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,720
in the different labs and different

773
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,520
disease areas compartments and

774
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,200
everything else

775
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,639
you'll actually see that people start

776
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,360
coming to you and

777
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,400
it's it's very important with these guys

778
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,240
to understand i mean

779
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,679
we've had examples of these highly

780
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,480
intelligent cats

781
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,679
taking our hpc's to try and figure out

782
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,559
how performing

783
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:58,320
yeah cloud environments yes keep going

784
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,879
well the hpc environment performance

785
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,760
computing

786
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,200
yes was internal and we had a guy in one

787
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:07,120
of our labs

788
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:09,919
who had crank in the cpu yeah just

789
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,639
burned thousands of cpu quarters and

790
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:12,960
then going away

791
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,240
right so one of the so our hpc guys can

792
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,559
say look we have a problem

793
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,080
we think possibly it's bitcoin mining or

794
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,840
something we'll go look into it

795
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,439
so we wouldn't looked into it we came

796
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,720
back and the gentleman

797
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:27,760
in in this case was a really nice guy

798
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:30,240
who had a few years ago found a

799
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,200
new prime number new prime number and

800
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,919
you know got a little bit of

801
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,279
uh notoriety from it and wanted to find

802
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,760
the next one

803
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:39,919
so he decided to crank up these really

804
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,919
expensive you had access to it let's go

805
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,520
yeah really expensive piece of equipment

806
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,159
and started to go and write his own

807
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,600
script

808
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,880
and throw it out there these are the

809
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,080
types of situations

810
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:55,279
where you're like say what that

811
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:58,240
you come across day to day right and

812
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:58,960
it's it's it's it's trying to then

813
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,720
communicate

814
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,240
why a this is not what's supposed to be

815
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,760
done right but

816
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,080
it's not a security incident at that

817
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:08,000
time right after we figured out

818
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,120
but now it's a management institute

819
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,840
right um

820
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,360
so i know we're actually we blaze

821
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,199
through a lot so we're going to kind of

822
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,678
give you a little bit of a bonus example

823
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,520
and

824
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,039
we're about halfway through so we can

825
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,639
actually give you some other anecdotal

826
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,679
and then touch into ot as well if you

827
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,080
really wanted to

828
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,039
so do you want to do the space one yeah

829
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,559
so

830
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,399
as you can guess i worked in the space

831
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:30,320
industry um

832
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,520
wonderful place where you say the funny

833
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,200
thing is we're responsible for the

834
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,559
network and within

835
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,480
this organization i'm not going to say

836
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,360
the name of the european space craft

837
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,520
operation center

838
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,719
at all and within this we own the

839
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,559
complete ground operations the

840
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,279
communications between the satellites

841
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,639
between

842
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:47,279
the um ground stations and the satellite

843
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,840
controllers

844
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:51,279
we are literally in the middle and it

845
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,959
was a lot of fun

846
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:56,880
and one thing that i first learned at uh

847
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,320
going moving into the spacecraft injury

848
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,360
is how old

849
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:03,600
technology is and if you see in that

850
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,158
beautiful picture there there is a

851
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,039
beautiful beautiful computer love it to

852
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:10,159
death

853
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:12,399
if you look closely there is

854
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,440
a spot coming out of the side now this

855
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,000
computer is about

856
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,679
right now 40 40 years old right could be

857
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,559
a little bit older it's a bull honeywell

858
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,559
station computer

859
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,559
those things coming out of the court do

860
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:28,000
you have any clue

861
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:31,440
what that is outside of christy who

862
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:34,559
has been in my presentations before

863
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:37,840
now 40 years ago we also had

864
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,240
liquid called computers it's not a new

865
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,320
thing

866
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,000
everybody thought it was cool when they

867
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,639
first heard about gaming computers that

868
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:48,240
were literally liquid cured i was like

869
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:51,279
really no that actually

870
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,360
is uh is a is the cooling

871
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,320
water cooling for that that station

872
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:57,120
computer now

873
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,080
question will this state do you think

874
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,439
that the station is

875
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:03,039
still in play today so here

876
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,799
before i left a few years ago we

877
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:08,399
actually built a station computer

878
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:09,679
uh for uh in software right first off we

879
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:11,439
couldn't run it in software because we

880
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,039
couldn't find a

881
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,480
processor slow enough to run it because

882
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:17,279
it would over would go far

883
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,919
too fast yeah so if you've ever played a

884
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,760
ring

885
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:21,600
uh wing commander on it you'll remember

886
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:24,000
the literally you go through the mind

887
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,520
yes um the asteroid code like just not

888
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,960
get hit by one because collision

889
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:30,720
detection wouldn't know this would run

890
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:33,679
too fast um so we had to build it

891
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,159
and re and and de-clock it uh because of

892
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,600
how

893
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,960
how fast they run secondly

894
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,520
it was less than a meg the size of the

895
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,120
size of the emulator we built and you

896
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:47,039
have to understand with it

897
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:50,158
with aerospace right you get one shot

898
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:51,039
because you have aged technology and

899
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,720
satellites

900
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:55,360
orbiting the earth that are going to

901
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,360
drop a payload for lack of a better term

902
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,639
two receivers that are sitting and

903
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,039
waiting

904
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,760
assuming you know where that satellite

905
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,158
is yeah

906
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,879
so it's it's very interesting with with

907
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,520
uh with

908
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,480
whether it is like she said when it

909
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,200
drops the payload

910
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,720
it's cleaned its memory bank so it

911
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,279
within the space

912
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,159
industry during the night the biggest

913
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,840
importance was

914
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,320
availability and integrity they didn't

915
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,918
care about confidentiality not because

916
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,678
you know they the thing is is they had

917
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:25,200
to get that data once that data was out

918
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:26,720
of the satellite it was gone

919
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,320
it would start doing its pictures or

920
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,919
whatever and go around again right

921
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:34,720
what's the the um measurement for error

922
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,399
like well we would have to make sure

923
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,640
that everything was set up

924
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:40,320
back then anywhere up to an hour before

925
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,159
and then it's constantly sending

926
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,840
sending signals to make sure you let you

927
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,799
link on the great thing about it is you

928
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,720
have this window

929
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:48,720
and your satellite goes like this and

930
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,799
then once it's out it's out

931
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,840
right so you try to get all the data uh

932
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:54,559
the other thing that's kind of

933
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:57,600
interesting with with satellites is

934
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:59,039
steven today most satellites are built

935
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,799
so if i build a satellite today

936
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,559
for a satellite to pre-release in two or

937
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,760
three years a day it's normally being

938
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:05,279
designed with

939
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,960
with technology that's already one or

940
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:08,880
two years yeah right there

941
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,799
are there are satellites out there that

942
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,519
know windows vista

943
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:14,799
you know so adding some up there with uh

944
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,720
you know an old version of

945
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:19,120
and these are hard time system like if

946
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:22,320
you missed it by a couple of seconds

947
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:24,799
it is way over

948
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:27,439
you know work globally and you know the

949
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:30,720
the space industry both uh nasa and

950
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:33,279
and uh european space agency

951
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,320
maybe not so much elon musk's one but

952
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:37,279
they're new

953
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:39,120
you know they all use old old technology

954
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,080
because the problem is they have so much

955
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,239
legacy out there

956
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,678
right and this kind of goes into the

957
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,600
challenges with ot

958
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:48,159
yeah which slides slowly over the ot

959
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:51,360
yeah just think of ot and space

960
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:53,039
yeah so like a tv show you know but it's

961
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,840
it's a very interesting uh

962
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,559
dilemma for the spacecraft controllers

963
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,320
because

964
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:59,760
once if they don't have any data the

965
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,399
next thing they're coming to

966
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,760
is the network team to understand where

967
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:06,000
the data could get lost

968
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,519
and a lot of times now there's there now

969
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,320
of course a lot of the new spacecraft

970
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,720
controllers have

971
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,000
have uh have a good um memory banks to

972
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,480
keep a lot of the data for a while we're

973
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,039
done

974
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,159
yeah but we used to run x25 which is a

975
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:19,200
guaranteed delivery

976
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:21,200
right and then even when tcpip came out

977
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,039
and what we didn't move across because

978
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,399
we needed a guaranteed delivery of the

979
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:26,879
data constantly

980
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:28,000
so with some parallels into ot and

981
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,480
manufacturing

982
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,760
right so within drug discovery lab

983
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,000
environments these are

984
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,440
again real-time systems hard systems

985
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,720
that are very bespoke kind of like

986
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,600
satellites as well

987
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,960
that are built on at the time it could

988
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:44,559
have been decent to good

989
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:46,480
operating systems um and there are one

990
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:48,240
or two of these devices out there so

991
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,000
like a mass spectrometer there's

992
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,519
like four in the world they're sitting

993
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,960
on windows embedded

994
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:58,159
if that um and they're qualified

995
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,559
for doing drug research in humans and

996
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,080
you

997
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:04,879
can't change it very much right

998
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:06,559
so being able to make updates to it you

999
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,000
can't actually guarantee that the

1000
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:10,960
integrity of the information

1001
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,519
is the same also that company that made

1002
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,080
these

1003
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:16,080
five or so pieces of scientific

1004
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,039
equipment might not be around anymore

1005
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,039
they might have been

1006
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:21,600
bellied up for whatever reason but the

1007
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:23,279
actual device is in a long-term study

1008
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,719
gathering information

1009
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:29,360
um so you have the challenges of

1010
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,120
these are classic ot challenges right as

1011
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,519
soon as your product or your machine is

1012
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,279
out there in the wild it's starting to

1013
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,640
deprecate and become more risky as far

1014
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:40,480
as vulnerability

1015
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:42,240
um but in a controlled environment where

1016
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,559
you can't touch it and it's sitting on

1017
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:47,760
your network so thinking of how to be

1018
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:49,360
able to have compensating controls um

1019
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,799
kind of getting into a little more of

1020
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,199
the ot realm um

1021
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:55,279
is a constant challenge for us as well

1022
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:59,279
as you have cats bringing in

1023
00:33:55,279 --> 00:34:01,279
alexas and crazy stuff um because again

1024
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:02,799
super intelligent they like technology

1025
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,919
let's bring some google glasses in here

1026
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:06,080
back in the day

1027
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:07,279
um oh yeah we had google glasses for a

1028
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,119
while as well

1029
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:10,560
um but the the other thing that's that's

1030
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,079
uh that steps out here is

1031
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,679
you've got to realize that all the old

1032
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:16,800
technology within

1033
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,800
within the different realms have

1034
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,000
different purpose yeah have a purpose

1035
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,839
and different

1036
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,159
vulnerabilities that will never ever get

1037
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:25,918
patched right you'll have systems that

1038
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:27,440
have no clue what encryption is or

1039
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:28,158
you'll have system that needs to drop a

1040
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,359
payload

1041
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:34,560
every every 24 hours and

1042
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:37,199
you it's it's using smb version one

1043
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,759
right and this goes back into there's no

1044
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:40,879
one

1045
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:43,839
right fit size like okay we have these

1046
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:47,359
devices we now must be gxp compliant

1047
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:49,119
how do we do it we ourselves are our own

1048
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,639
cats in this case we have to think

1049
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,639
laterally outside the box

1050
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,240
yeah and in a lot of times it's working

1051
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,639
very closely with the people

1052
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:57,598
right so if you go back to like looking

1053
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,480
at um

1054
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:01,119
sporting goods companies right what are

1055
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,480
people

1056
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,160
what do they have that's really

1057
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,040
important to protect right

1058
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:08,640
sure a marketing deck because they want

1059
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,279
to come first to market with a new

1060
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,000
shoe and uh right oh so the new shoe

1061
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,599
needs to be

1062
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,440
needs to be protected but a lot of

1063
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,680
people don't understand that

1064
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,079
sporting goods companies like adidas

1065
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:23,440
nike reebok

1066
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:26,800
you know keen new balance

1067
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:29,839
have actually really good

1068
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,960
research teams right they are they are

1069
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:34,240
creating

1070
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,640
new rubbers that are part of the shoe

1071
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,640
you

1072
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,000
think that the the base of your shoe is

1073
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,160
one piece of rubber and

1074
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,359
in fact depending on what you need that

1075
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,960
shoe for that

1076
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,560
shoe may have three different parts of

1077
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,359
rubber in there for

1078
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,560
for impact and for your heel and for the

1079
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:51,598
arch of your shoe and

1080
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:53,680
it looks and feels exactly the same

1081
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,960
and they've been spending five years

1082
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,680
creating this rubber

1083
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,119
right so it's very interesting that how

1084
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:02,640
all of these companies

1085
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:05,200
look and take the cia principle i mean

1086
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,160
working working for a research company

1087
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,879
golf heads

1088
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,440
you know have a lot of research that

1089
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,680
goes in

1090
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,599
golf clubs club heads yes they have a

1091
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,200
lot of research to go into them and

1092
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:17,040
you sit down with some of these people

1093
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,839
who are looking at different metals

1094
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:21,920
they're getting boutique metals brought

1095
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:24,560
in to try and see if a little bit of

1096
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:27,839
this compound will actually change the

1097
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:30,320
the way that the metal uh will resonate

1098
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:31,680
and and and bounce you know so it's a

1099
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:36,000
very interesting

1100
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:38,640
way the things move you know

1101
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,359
so we have about wow we blazed through

1102
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,400
that

1103
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:46,240
so we have about 10 15

1104
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:50,560
20 minutes ish um any last anecdotes

1105
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:53,040
that you have for the audience

1106
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,480
i mean it's it's it's very it's very

1107
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,839
different in each one of these these

1108
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,920
fields of what

1109
00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:02,160
you have to do right um to me

1110
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,280
the thing that got me further through

1111
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,799
all of this

1112
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:10,480
is understanding social engineering

1113
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:12,560
you know learning to read people because

1114
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,680
honestly when you're sitting and talking

1115
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:17,119
to people who are

1116
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:19,839
seriously smart most i'm not gonna lie

1117
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:21,040
everybody in the in that i've met in

1118
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:24,160
this industry

1119
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:26,160
is smarter than me right and i

1120
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,759
have to understand what they're trying

1121
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:31,680
to communicate to me

1122
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:33,200
it's confusing it's technical

1123
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,118
but it's the same way when i start

1124
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:38,160
getting technical with them

1125
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:40,000
about security you know i will

1126
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,440
walk into a meeting with somebody and

1127
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,560
the scientists will go

1128
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:46,079
and start going la la la la la databases

1129
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,680
la la la la la internet

1130
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:50,240
right and i have to figure out they want

1131
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:53,359
to put their databases on the internet

1132
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:54,560
right or i don't get it but this is

1133
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:56,319
where

1134
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,320
working with them understanding and

1135
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,079
building a lot of the

1136
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,359
you know credibility that they actually

1137
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:04,560
are also looking for

1138
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:06,720
you're establishing trust yeah um trust

1139
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,720
via social engineering active listening

1140
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:12,399
and clear communications

1141
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:16,319
yeah which is tiring right but it's

1142
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:18,079
sorely needed uh across

1143
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,920
in within our industries when you're

1144
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:21,760
actually in a position where you need to

1145
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,720
protect an organization yeah

1146
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:26,400
and it it's it's it's always

1147
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,560
phenomenally interesting

1148
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,880
in any one of the the organizations that

1149
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,799
you work in that if you take the time to

1150
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,880
watch people and listen to people you'll

1151
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:38,560
understand the organization a lot better

1152
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,359
you know and you know i tend to do all

1153
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,000
my meetings

1154
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:43,839
in in a cafe so they don't feel like

1155
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,320
it's in a meeting room or it's

1156
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:47,759
you know it's it's also trying to get

1157
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,359
their trust and relaxation

1158
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,760
somebody's relaxed you're in a better

1159
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:52,720
place if people trust you and they're

1160
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,320
relaxed

1161
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:57,040
this is more of the risk manager in me

1162
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:59,839
right and they identify risks

1163
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,320
or concerns they will approach you and

1164
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:03,440
your

1165
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:05,760
team sooner than

1166
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,119
later right so this is a i got a

1167
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,000
question but i just

1168
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:11,280
downloaded this public data set around

1169
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,800
these clinical

1170
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,400
studies and i don't quite know what to

1171
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,839
do because it's now been mashed up and

1172
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:19,040
i'm dealing with pii

1173
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:22,720
and i rather have these conversations

1174
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:24,079
sooner versus later and historically

1175
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,919
with regards to just

1176
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,280
any sort of a research organization in

1177
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:31,040
general as soon as you

1178
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:33,280
hear security or information security

1179
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:36,400
right there there's a stigma that we

1180
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:38,400
as professionals need to break um so

1181
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,440
that one we're approachable and two

1182
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,400
we're here

1183
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,920
to help you employ within the business

1184
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,280
do what you need to do

1185
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,960
right where are your meat shields for

1186
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:49,359
lack of a better term yeah

1187
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,640
yeah and as you can see from from a lot

1188
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:53,920
of it is it's

1189
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:57,520
every every one of these companies uses

1190
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,320
the cia principle implicitly but without

1191
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,880
calling it out

1192
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,680
yeah and and different different values

1193
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,880
yeah right

1194
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,960
you know it's important for a

1195
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,480
pharmaceutical company to protect their

1196
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,480
everything everything yeah you know the

1197
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,000
m a's and what but that's not saying

1198
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,560
that research companies don't do

1199
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,760
emanates they do targeted m as for

1200
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,078
different things as well

1201
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,920
but it's not figuring out rick's posture

1202
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:20,880
yeah right you know for them it's it's

1203
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,520
it's also a level of we'll do one mma

1204
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,760
whereas a

1205
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,560
the pharmaceutical company will do 30 m

1206
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,680
as in a year

1207
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:29,520
right or a sporting goods company

1208
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:31,759
will decide to come up with a shoe i

1209
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,520
mean if you look at the adidas one

1210
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,800
every company out there was doing the

1211
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,839
adidas one research

1212
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,599
right to come up with the intelligent

1213
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:42,720
shoe nike was doing it

1214
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:45,440
internally in in keane and

1215
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,799
all of them yeah it was it the shoe was

1216
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,960
not amazing

1217
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,079
but everyone was doing it everybody was

1218
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,520
doing it but it was

1219
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:53,599
it was just to be the first company out

1220
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,520
there so it was like top secret projects

1221
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:56,880
like in in pharmaceutical companies they

1222
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:59,040
have these top secret projects

1223
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,160
and once you learn the cia principle for

1224
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,480
organization

1225
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:04,078
um you can then have conversations with

1226
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,920
upper management because again

1227
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:07,599
going back to the earlier slide which

1228
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,640
i'll probably pull up in a second

1229
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:13,920
um one of our nightmares is budget

1230
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:15,680
yeah so during a time where it is

1231
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,440
you know global pandemic and your

1232
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,680
budget's this big right

1233
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,520
how do you effectively convey to those

1234
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,598
who are going to grant budget

1235
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,119
um how the controls that you need to put

1236
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:25,440
into place or the technologies that you

1237
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,640
need to

1238
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,960
put in place for your information

1239
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:31,118
security program um

1240
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,160
that's in line with the risk posture of

1241
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,560
the cia

1242
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:36,160
posture of your organization yeah and

1243
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,799
you can only so many times

1244
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,078
lean on regulations yeah because it

1245
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,680
comes to the point where unless

1246
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:43,920
regulations haven't changed

1247
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:46,240
at that time you can't lean on it

1248
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,400
because in theory you should already be

1249
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,319
regulated and in the right place

1250
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:53,440
otherwise you could stop

1251
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:55,040
research you could stop a drug right so

1252
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,119
when you walk into those rooms and

1253
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:59,440
you're talking to senior management

1254
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:00,960
who have no experience or knowledge

1255
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,760
within information security

1256
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,720
yeah you're you're you're leaning on in

1257
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,040
like research

1258
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:08,480
integrity right you know guys we need to

1259
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,440
make sure we want to do a data

1260
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,960
classification

1261
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,560
project because we need to make sure we

1262
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,960
need to know what to protect yes

1263
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:16,560
you know all right so with that i'd like

1264

and then we'll give everyone a few

1279
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,040
minutes to take a quick break before the

1280
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,759
two o'clock show starts

1281
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,960
and i would definitely agree with uh

1282
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,839
cthulhu

1283
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,480
who says a lot of the scientists do have

1284
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:54,480
yeah

1285
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,839
and they have great i.t skills they code

1286
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,240
as well

1287
00:42:55,839 --> 00:43:00,160
yeah they will just throw information

1288
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,959
and data sets not necessarily following

1289
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,279
good practice

1290
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,599
at all or even design patterns because

1291
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,119
they are gigantic scripters at this

1292
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:10,079
point get the data to it let's go

1293
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:10,800
don't care how dirty it is yeah so or

1294
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:13,200
they get a

1295
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,480
tool they'll write a code to make the

1296
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,598
the front end of the tool look better

1297
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,119
because they didn't like the color of

1298
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:20,079
the other one or they'll buy a tool

1299
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,960
and just intersect it into their laptop

1300
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:23,359
right like it's just

1301
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:25,680
it is what it is awesome well thank you

1302
