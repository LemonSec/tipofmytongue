1
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:29,110
forgot sorry this is static analysis and

2
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,680
secure coding could it have saved the

3
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:37,620
Deathstar

4
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:37,620
oh my sides are not working

5
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:50,620
NAFTA change down I guess there we go

6
00:00:46,019 --> 00:00:51,040
okay we're all familiar where we should

7
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:56,379
be

8
00:00:51,040 --> 00:01:02,199
oh it's not showing my videos aren't

9
00:00:56,379 --> 00:01:08,560
showing sorry I thought everybody would

10
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:15,460
be able to see this got a video and it's

11
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:24,600
not showing how do I get it a full

12
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:24,600
screen no that's still not showing I'm

13
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:55,560
sorry

14
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:55,560
technical malfunction here full screen

15
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:03,699
well we've all seen the video where the

16
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,590
death star blows up I was going to show

17
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,860
you the video but it's not working right

18
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:12,519
now

19
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:22,750
sorry you can hear it this is blowing up

20
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:24,790
right now that's the normal video with

21
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:27,750
it that what the dust are blowing up if

22
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:27,750
we go back to my slide

23
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,000
[Music]

24
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:46,300
did I actually go forward I think I did

25
00:02:41,310 --> 00:03:09,610
sorry I am going ahead and I didn't mean

26
00:02:46,300 --> 00:03:11,440
to bring technical difficulties I'm

27
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:15,340
having technical difficulties with my

28
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:35,160
slides for going forward I'm not meaning

29
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:37,300
for - okay sorry way too far ahead

30
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:42,370
basically we all know the story

31
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:46,420
Galen or so put in flaws into the Death

32
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:49,960
Star he asked a friend to give those

33
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:53,739
flaw give those in information to the

34
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:55,780
rebels part of those rebels included in

35
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:59,700
those rebels I should say was his

36
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:02,980
daughter Jen she along with the rebels

37
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:07,299
usually they were all bad guys but Jen

38
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:11,140
was just a little bit good she sent the

39
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:16,270
information off to the rebels and died

40
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:20,260
in the process Horton but the rebels

41
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:23,349
used the insider information and Luke

42
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:26,250
Skywalker blew up the Death Star we all

43
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:26,250
know that history

44
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:37,360
but what if the rebels didn't find the

45
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:40,080
information what if they'd use some kind

46
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,550
of tool like static code analysis or

47
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:46,539
secure coding what if there was some

48
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:49,629
kind of something done that found those

49
00:04:46,539 --> 00:04:53,650
flaws what if they didn't find the

50
00:04:49,629 --> 00:04:54,280
weakness and they couldn't blow up the

51
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,888
Death Star

52
00:04:54,280 --> 00:05:01,719
what could the history of Star Wars have

53
00:04:56,889 --> 00:05:05,110
been instead so we're going to kind of

54
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,970
go a little bit farther and discuss what

55
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:13,240
secure coding is and static code

56
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:15,340
analysis my biography okay I'm a cyber

57
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:18,699
engineer at Raytheon and I've been there

58
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:20,198
for about 28 years not just in cyber

59
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:22,740
because of course cyber engineering

60
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:26,110
hasn't been around that long

61
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:28,860
at least not for most of us I've been a

62
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:31,659
software engineer for almost 25 years

63
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:34,690
just recently got a master's degree in

64
00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:36,580
cyber engineering though and started

65
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:39,990
working in the cyber department at

66
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:44,258
Raytheon and I work with a couple of my

67
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:46,569
cohorts down there in the middle and now

68
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:51,940
I'm but now I'm working on the software

69
00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:54,759
side of cyber helping our groups of all

70
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:56,729
of it'll let a lot of my legacy we've

71
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:58,960
got a couple new programs though and

72
00:05:56,729 --> 00:06:02,469
trying to help them figure out what

73
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,150
secure coding actually means so a lot of

74
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:06,880
the programs don't understand what

75
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:09,310
secure coding actually means so that's

76
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:13,930
that's kind of a new topic for a lot of

77
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:17,949
people I help them with setting up their

78
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:20,169
secure coding as well as setting up

79
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:22,750
their static code analysis tools I do I

80
00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:25,419
brought a lot of bad scripts I hope them

81
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:27,759
with setting up the tools and then after

82
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:28,900
the fact helping them analyze the issues

83
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:35,469
because a lot of the issues

84
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:38,258
unfortunately come out kind of in ways

85
00:06:35,469 --> 00:06:41,740
that are a little hard to well it's just

86
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:43,000
a cryptic I found some the other day

87
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:45,069
that said there

88
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,509
it's parser errors and they were just

89
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:53,530
basically coding errors that were very

90
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:55,750
bizarre let's just say but we're gonna

91
00:06:53,530 --> 00:07:01,318
figure those out and help the developers

92
00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:01,319
fix their code they were just bad coding

93
00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:09,550
basically we'll go on and discuss what

94
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:11,560
secure coding actually means basically

95
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:16,199
secure coding it's the practice of using

96
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:19,330
secure coding principles let it

97
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:21,610
basically it's the overall interface of

98
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:25,060
secure coding interface between the

99
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:26,650
system and software and there are cheat

100
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,240
sheets you don't have to understand

101
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:31,659
everything about secure coding

102
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:34,199
oo-aah does have high-level guidances on

103
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:36,580
how to actually write secure code

104
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:39,580
there's different languages and

105
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:42,520
different secure coding principles for

106
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:45,909
each language I've included the

107
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:49,539
interface or the the URL for each of

108
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:53,580
those cheat sheets and I when I went out

109
00:07:49,539 --> 00:07:56,050
to those those are pretty good and then

110
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:58,690
because if you do use the secure coding

111
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:00,400
principles it does limit the

112
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:02,919
vulnerabilities that you would find in

113
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,530
your code so that's why we actually

114
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:08,198
recommend system or software packages

115
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:10,570
and programs use those secure coding

116
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:12,250
principles because you eliminate coding

117
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:18,070
errors but you also eliminate the

118
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:20,800
vulnerabilities in your systems secure

119
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:23,740
coding risks that could be injected if

120
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:27,930
you don't do not use secure coding could

121
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:31,950
be injection broken authentication

122
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:35,380
broken access control insecure

123
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:39,270
deserialization I could go on but

124
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:42,520
basically you all can read all of these

125
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:45,910
sensitive data exposure all of these

126
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:48,310
buffer overflows a lot of us a lot of us

127
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:50,529
are familiar with these top these titles

128
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:54,939
but how many of us are actually familiar

129
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:56,000
with what these mean you will be in just

130
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:58,490
a minute because

131
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:04,759
I'll give you some ideas in some actual

132
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:11,290
examples sequel injection this is an

133
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:15,980
example of a sequel injection okay using

134
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:18,019
untrusted data in a sequel call okay

135
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:22,339
fright here they're just calling with

136
00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:27,829
customer ID and just calling with ID if

137
00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:31,730
you just modify the sequel ID to say or

138
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:36,410
one equals one you'll actually get all

139
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:39,610
of the data for every single ID for

140
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:44,480
every single column every single table

141
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:52,459
everything in the database very simple

142
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:54,709
change one command that's what a sequel

143
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:57,680
injection is most people don't

144
00:09:54,709 --> 00:10:02,239
understand but that's just one simple

145
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:07,189
easy change sequel injection attacks can

146
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:10,639
can make very big differences in 2008

147
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:13,790
sequel injection attacks caused 130

148
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:18,410
million dollar or million credit and

149
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:21,199
debit cards to be affected they caused

150
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:25,910
Dave and Bester OfficeMax and Barnes

151
00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:33,370
Noble to be affected 130 million credit

152
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:39,860
cards were hacked this is an X X X X e

153
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:43,309
attack this one is attempting to extract

154
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:49,480
data from a server oh you gotta do is

155
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:49,480
pass in this one it set your password

156
00:10:50,769 --> 00:10:55,699
this one is causing a denial of service

157
00:10:53,449 --> 00:11:01,149
because it's passing in a random value

158
00:10:55,699 --> 00:11:05,589
that is a file that is an endless file

159
00:11:01,149 --> 00:11:05,589
this one just never ends

160
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:14,550
all you have to do so that you never

161
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:18,709
have this excess xx E is make sure that

162
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:24,269
your soap frameworks and your sam'l

163
00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:33,059
files your are patched that way you

164
00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:37,040
don't get these xxe attacks improper

165
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:44,059
input validation oh this is a fun one

166
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:49,800
this one this one you pass in a price a

167
00:11:44,059 --> 00:11:54,749
quantity multiply the price times the

168
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:56,689
quantity you get a total but say you see

169
00:11:54,749 --> 00:12:00,449
you sending a price that's negative

170
00:11:56,689 --> 00:12:04,740
guess what happens the person actually

171
00:12:00,449 --> 00:12:10,618
instead of getting debited they will get

172
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:15,540
credited so that's why people should

173
00:12:10,619 --> 00:12:23,040
always check for things like this they

174
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:24,509
should always validate your inputs these

175
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,009
were just some examples I couldn't

176
00:12:24,509 --> 00:12:27,689
include a whole bunch of examples of

177
00:12:26,009 --> 00:12:31,139
everything but these are just some

178
00:12:27,689 --> 00:12:34,349
examples of the top 10 first he first

179
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:36,509
secure coding training for secure coding

180
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:39,329
he founded a whole bunch of different

181
00:12:36,509 --> 00:12:42,870
places but some of these are just some

182
00:12:39,329 --> 00:12:44,878
of the top whitehat secure coding I

183
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:47,220
actually have this certification by the

184
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:49,860
way I was one of the first ones to go

185
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:52,439
through this this training white hat

186
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,240
certified secure developer they offer

187
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:56,639
that training and that one when I took

188
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,470
it since I wasn't the first one maybe

189
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,899
that was the only time it was free but

190
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:02,699
it is free and it was free when I took

191
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:07,379
it I'm not sure if it still is it might

192
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:12,689
still be free secure code warrior has

193
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:14,670
training and I think it's free may only

194
00:13:12,689 --> 00:13:16,949
be free for the first 14 days you take

195
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:18,800
it or sign up for it but they do have

196
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:24,560
free training

197
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:26,660
and cyber re has secure coding but I'm

198
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:32,719
not sure if it's free you may actually

199
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:34,959
have to sign up for that at Raytheon we

200
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,970
do have SkillSoft

201
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,619
training that one's included in our

202
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:43,399
company I'm not sure if a lot of other

203
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:44,600
companies offer that or not but you

204
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:46,490
might be able to get that through your

205
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,240
company and there's a lawful lot of

206
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:49,240
those yes sir

207
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:55,940
that's true ACM does have a lot I forgot

208
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:58,869
about that one we used to be able to get

209
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:01,370
that through our company - I'm not sure

210
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:03,589
yeah I wasn't sure yeah I forgot about

211
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:05,540
that because I was able to get that from

212
00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:06,640
when I was taking my masters I forgot

213
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:08,959
about that one

214
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,699
that's awesome I had to remember to add

215
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:15,069
that to my slide because I'm given the

216
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:17,600
same presentation for another training

217
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:21,500
later on a couple more couple more

218
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,790
months this one is a certification you

219
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,310
can get from sei

220
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:30,040
it's a certified secure developer yes

221
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:30,040
sir sure go ahead

222
00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:38,209
this certified secure developer excuse

223
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,209
me certified secure professional is only

224
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:43,670
for C and C++ they do also have one for

225
00:14:41,209 --> 00:14:46,010
Java if you want one for Java but this

226
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:48,979
one's for C and C++

227
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:52,160
I'm only right now most of my programs

228
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:54,170
are C and C++ we do have some Java but

229
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,140
not as much Java most of our programs

230
00:14:54,170 --> 00:15:07,930
are legacy so we even have ADA

231
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:07,930
a lot of ADA so yeah don't laugh okay

232
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:19,729
but yet so this is basically the top top

233
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:24,170
at the cwe top 25 I'm not reading my

234
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:27,140
slide the top 25 most dangerous can be

235
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:30,199
found here and then the all o hasta top

236
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:32,030
10 of course the OAuth subterra the the

237
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:36,349
web application ones

238
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:40,449
and then the sands and cwe top-25 now

239
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:44,090
those you know can change as you go

240
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:47,000
every so many years though that list

241
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:51,920
does change and the the list that I'm

242
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:57,710
giving in my slide the OA is the 2017 so

243
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:59,390
that is fairly recent I think they are

244
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:02,630
coming out with the 2019

245
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:05,300
I saw a reference to it but I haven't

246
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:11,120
seen the actual list yet most most still

247
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:13,910
referenced in 2017 okay static code

248
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,310
analysis this is like this is what I do

249
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:20,120
a lot of my days is actually just going

250
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:22,219
through issues a lot I mean like I said

251
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:25,250
I've got 13 programs so I'm spending my

252
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:28,040
days going through issues for programs

253
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:30,890
but basically static analysis is running

254
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:34,010
a program or executing the program when

255
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:36,460
it's not really running so you're just

256
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:39,620
basically building the program and

257
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:41,990
trying to run code or finding flaws when

258
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:45,230
the code is not actually executing it's

259
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:47,420
not actually doing anything you're just

260
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:51,770
building it and so you're trying to find

261
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:56,300
flaws malicious malicious code any kind

262
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:59,329
of backdoors you're trying to find any

263
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:03,770
anything that does not follow industry

264
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:06,650
standards and it's more cost efficient

265
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:11,290
to run it this way because you're

266
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:13,579
finding flaws before it actually gets to

267
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:15,560
earlier in the development cycle let's

268
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:17,629
just say that because we're finding

269
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:22,429
flaws just as people are putting code

270
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:24,170
into the the CM process so every time

271
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:26,890
we've got it set up so a lot of our

272
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:30,140
programs any time they put new code in a

273
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:32,870
process gets kicked off and they run

274
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:36,200
static code analysis so that way we're

275
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:38,959
finding issues real time pretty much so

276
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:44,750
this is this is a more cost efficient

277
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:47,690
process tools can find security issues

278
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:53,530
again buffer overflows string overflows

279
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:55,550
sequel injections hashes password hashes

280
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:59,180
Kryptos we've actually I've actually

281
00:17:55,550 --> 00:18:01,430
found kryptos that are out of date which

282
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:08,240
shouldn't surprise anybody if we've got

283
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:11,710
legacy code syntax related dead code oh

284
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:14,360
heck yeah we got a lot of dead code

285
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:20,000
unreachable code I'm finding a lot of

286
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:22,879
that to check we used a lot of different

287
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,900
checkers and we're actually updating

288
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:30,250
with new checkers next week I can't wait

289
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,250
to see what we're gonna find next week

290
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:36,970
but checkers can find software issues

291
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:40,370
software issues being things like this

292
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:42,710
uninitialized values rule violations

293
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:46,129
member corruptions resource leaks all

294
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:49,430
kinds of things like that but they can

295
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:51,500
also find cyber issues that's kind of

296
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:54,490
those security issues we all like to

297
00:18:51,500 --> 00:19:03,770
talk about sequel injection overflows

298
00:18:54,490 --> 00:19:07,390
secure coding malicious data there's a

299
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:10,160
lot of we use the more of the commercial

300
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:12,640
side of the static code analysis but

301
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:16,220
there are open source tools as well

302
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:18,260
tools are available for almost any kind

303
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:23,840
of language you can think of like I said

304
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:26,840
we've got a to see we're gonna be having

305
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:29,169
some androids that hopefully we'll be

306
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:31,580
able to ski in soon and they're kind of

307
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:34,340
interested in us actually scanning some

308
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:39,020
of the Android tools soon we've got the

309
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:41,090
VB the XML I haven't found any of the

310
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:45,290
XML that actually raised anything yet

311
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:46,970
but I'm interested in saying that and

312
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:50,030
the visual basic I can't wait to see

313
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:53,120
some of the vbe code actually raises but

314
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:55,399
there's a lot of languages out there and

315
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,409
a lot of code that can be brought up I

316
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,029
would love to see some of the COBOL if

317
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:03,350
we actually

318
00:19:59,029 --> 00:20:06,080
I've load to see some I I'm I that was

319
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:08,869
my favorite language in college so to

320
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:13,999
see some COBOL output we don't have any

321
00:20:08,869 --> 00:20:15,769
at our site so this is an example of a

322
00:20:13,999 --> 00:20:19,690
static something you would get from

323
00:20:15,769 --> 00:20:25,570
static analysis like a like a dead code

324
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:29,619
this one it could never become no

325
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:33,350
because this is setting as equal to null

326
00:20:29,619 --> 00:20:35,509
so it goes into this if statement and

327
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:37,070
since it's already set Eston all this

328
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:41,210
statement should would never be raised

329
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:44,689
so this is a dead dead piece of code it

330
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:46,519
would never be raised not no never is

331
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:49,009
going to get there it's gonna return

332
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:51,830
here never gonna go in here

333
00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:54,740
this parts never going to be never be

334
00:20:51,830 --> 00:21:03,110
run because it's always gonna go in here

335
00:20:54,740 --> 00:21:09,440
and be returned this is an unchecked

336
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:14,649
error condition it's it's this do

337
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:20,179
exchange this one it goes into this try

338
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:21,709
do it says this this catch is never

339
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:24,409
going to do anything because it's going

340
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:26,690
to try do but it's never going to catch

341
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:29,450
this it's always going to go in here do

342
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:33,139
exchange this is it's never going to

343
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:44,259
catch this always going to do the try

344
00:21:33,139 --> 00:21:49,939
but never going to do the exchange and

345
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:54,409
then the crypto because does has been

346
00:21:49,940 --> 00:22:01,820
replaced by a EES these would get caught

347
00:21:54,409 --> 00:22:07,419
as risky Kryptos in any static code

348
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:07,418
analysis this is C this is the Java

349
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,879
so the

350
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:15,730
does we'd get caught and this des and C

351
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:27,150
would get caught because it's looking

352
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:31,390
for something replaced with an Aes and

353
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:35,590
then this is a buffer overflow so if you

354
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:38,620
go into this code and as setting last

355
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:41,530
name to 20 you enter it's saying

356
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:46,899
internal last name you go into this and

357
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:51,160
you say in our last name of very very

358
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:54,130
long last name with underscores between

359
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:57,340
each one that would be over 24

360
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:59,559
characters this would actually cause

361
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:03,159
buffer overflow because that's 24

362
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:05,950
characters it would actually cause the

363
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:10,690
buffer to overflow because it doesn't

364
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:14,309
check for a size so you have to actually

365
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:17,950
check to make sure that last name is

366
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:21,250
actually going to actually put only 24

367
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:24,790
in here it never checks for the size

368
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:27,820
going in there it's just gonna say okay

369
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:31,809
give me something don't care what just

370
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:33,669
stick it in there it never checks so

371
00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:43,928
it's going to cause a buffer overflow if

372
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:52,780
last name is over 20 so do we have any

373
00:23:43,929 --> 00:23:57,970
questions yes sir well we don't we use

374
00:23:52,780 --> 00:24:04,750
commercial we we use Coverity for most

375
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:07,330
of our products the C C sharp C++ we

376
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:09,309
have a lot of different compilers that

377
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:13,230
we use the with those but then we also

378
00:24:09,309 --> 00:24:13,230
use code pair for the ADA side

379
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:30,020
yes sir I'm not we have an action i

380
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:32,149
haven't actually worked with any of the

381
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:33,830
Android devices yet so I'm not exactly

382
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:36,140
sure what languages those are gonna be

383
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:41,090
it all they've told me is it's gonna be

384
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:44,540
Android Christi do you know it's Java

385
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:47,510
okay yeah she said she's my point of

386
00:24:44,540 --> 00:25:02,810
contact for that forget I don't really

387
00:24:47,510 --> 00:25:05,870
know yet yes sir well it kind of depends

388
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:11,030
on the tools themselves and what

389
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:13,790
compilers are using if it's a let me put

390
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:18,560
it this way if it's a regular compiler

391
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:20,870
like visual visual studio let me put it

392
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:24,379
that way and if they don't have a lot of

393
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:26,000
legacy code normally it doesn't take me

394
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:27,800
that long to actually get it to work if

395
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,170
they have a like regular build scripts

396
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:32,600
and things like that but if they've got

397
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:36,190
like an out-there compiler like ADA

398
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:40,070
multi where they've got an off-the-wall

399
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:42,550
compiler running and I have to actually

400
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:45,080
go out and try to figure out which

401
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:46,639
compiler is actually being used because

402
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,649
I've had to do that I've spent days

403
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,780
trying to figure out what actually is

404
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:52,310
being built from the command line

405
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:54,889
because that's what I usually have to do

406
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:57,139
I have to go and make sure that Coverity

407
00:25:54,890 --> 00:26:00,140
is running the right build script

408
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:02,270
because I have to run from a command

409
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:07,520
line in order to be able to run these

410
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:11,120
builds create a build script from

411
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:13,370
Coverity and it but running from

412
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,919
Microsoft is great I mean that's not--

413
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:18,909
that's no biggie at all it's just a mess

414
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:22,550
build and that's from like Program Files

415
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:26,030
but some of these other ones are way out

416
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:27,950
there and it's taken me a while on some

417
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:30,320
of them to do it

418
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:32,660
but I've been able to it it's getting

419
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,939
better let's just put it that way but

420
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:37,070
Microsoft is easy those are one those

421
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:43,190
are very easy to set up usually it's

422
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:47,510
just and build analyze commit and you

423
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:48,800
just need three scripts but and then

424
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:51,020
checkers are awesome

425
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:57,889
they're they're not that hard to figure

426
00:26:51,020 --> 00:27:00,770
out either so next slide so back to the

427
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:03,920
initial question if the Empire had used

428
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:05,840
a secure cutting a secure code or static

429
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,730
analysis tool what would the would the

430
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:10,760
Empire where the outcome of the movies

431
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:13,820
have been different could the insider

432
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:15,980
threat would have the insider threat

433
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:19,790
have been left in the Death Star and

434
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:23,390
with the rebels have found been found

435
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:27,530
out and would the Death Star been blown

436
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:30,110
up so does anybody think that that it

437
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:33,320
would have been any different or you

438
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:34,959
know what are your what are your your to

439
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:42,860
what's your idea

440
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:51,470
does anybody have any opinions it is a

441
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:53,929
different project manager come on guys

442
00:27:51,470 --> 00:28:11,950
would my but my lightsaber have been

443
00:27:53,930 --> 00:28:11,950
main grade or red come on okay

444
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:23,980
[Laughter]

445
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:37,260
[Laughter]

446
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:43,809
[Music]

447
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:52,740
[Music]

448
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,440
[Laughter]

449
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:06,139
okay so we still learn how to green okay

450
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:28,289
[Laughter]

451
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:37,590
okay I think I've lost I think I've lost

452
00:29:28,289 --> 00:29:41,239
them all okay thank you

453
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:41,238
there's my research
