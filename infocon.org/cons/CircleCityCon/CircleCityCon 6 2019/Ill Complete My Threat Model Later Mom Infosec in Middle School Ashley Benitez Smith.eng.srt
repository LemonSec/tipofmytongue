1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,580
all right good afternoon everyone

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:08,460
welcome to my talk thanks for coming

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,650
I'm Ashley Benitez Smith and this is my

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,160
talk I'll complete my threat model later

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,790
mom

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:18,480
InfoSec in middle school so a little bit

7
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:21,270
about me I am a career technology

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,000
education teacher or CTE commonly known

9
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:27,000
as Tech Ed in Frederick County Public

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,039
Schools that's in Maryland my

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,929
certifications I'm currently certified

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,180
in secondary English 7th through 12th

13
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:34,980
grade middle school English and language

14
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,540
arts fourth through ninth grade and then

15
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,569
technology education seventh through

16
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,100
twelfth grade education background I'm

17
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,340
currently pursuing my Masters of Science

18
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,840
in curriculum and instruction in blended

19
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,969
computer science which I will talk about

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,610
more later in this talk and what that

21
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:52,890
means at Hood College in Maryland and

22
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,710
then I got my Bachelors of Arts in

23
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,989
English Lit from the University of

24
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:02,640
Maryland Baltimore County or UMBC as

25
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:04,140
it's known and I kind of have this up

26
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,640
here not to just say hey yes I'm

27
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,340
qualified to teach children I promise

28
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,040
but also to show you that a lot of

29
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,840
teachers going into computer science are

30
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,790
coming from other subject areas I

31
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,270
started out as a secondary English

32
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:20,430
language arts teacher and I kind of joke

33
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:23,158
about this but I was given a tech ed

34
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:26,790
class mainly because I'm really good at

35
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:29,310
turning a computer off and on but I have

36
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,140
I started out in my class with very tech

37
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,299
enhanced and then they kind of handed

38
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,310
schedule-wise you just worked out and I

39
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:37,320
absolutely fell in love with the type of

40
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:40,070
classes and how they're taught and I've

41
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,990
kind of never looked back since also uh

42
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:44,939
I'm more like kind of the space fear

43
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,970
from portal 2 where I'm just like I like

44
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:50,250
space I like InfoSec um I went to my

45
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,810
first Def Con at Def Con 20 just because

46
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,430
I have friends in two industries that

47
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,960
come on to Vegas it's great and I'm like

48
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,369
yeah sure okay and then I just kind of

49
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,529
fell in love with community and picking

50
00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:00,270
locks and breaking things and sometimes

51
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,399
it's terrifying but also really cool

52
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,439
what everyone does so that's kind of

53
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,710
where I'm coming from I'm obviously not

54
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:10,500
necessarily from computer science or

55
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:13,019
from the industry but I do love what you

56
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,520
guys do and I you

57
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:18,730
kind of wants you impart that passion

58
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,620
and knowledge to students so getting

59
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,820
into this talk today I'm gonna talk kind

60
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,070
of first start off with a lot of

61
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,570
computer science education initiatives

62
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:28,480
that are happening and then work my way

63
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:30,900
into security education so there are a

64
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,480
bunch of national initiatives happening

65
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:36,370
there 37 states and their governors kind

66
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,769
of signed on to bring computer science

67
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:41,920
education to their public school systems

68
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:43,420
which is great and I know code org they

69
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,640
sometimes get a lot of flack for some of

70
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,350
the things they do but they've been very

71
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,809
traumatic and kind of making that happen

72
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:51,579
and they've given they have kind of like

73
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,590
nine policies or principles that kind of

74
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:56,560
help States craft their own K through 12

75
00:02:53,590 --> 00:03:01,350
curriculum and I have a couple of links

76
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,350
up here that let's see if this works

77
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:08,650
yeah it worked that this is like the

78
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,660
most comprehensive kind of database or

79
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:12,280
report that I could find at you know

80
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,859
there's probably others that I maybe

81
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,480
didn't look at but it kind of shows the

82
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,940
K through 12 computer science like

83
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:22,209
policies and what states have done to

84
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:24,730
implement standards and some states are

85
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:28,240
further along than others it is a

86
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:30,310
process this is very new I know certain

87
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,080
states are sometime are just getting

88
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,360
funding or just approving this

89
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,250
initiative while other states like no

90
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,250
I'm from Maryland we have a timeline set

91
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:41,830
we're hitting some goals already and

92
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:43,420
just give you example by 2036 I have to

93
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:46,270
be certified in computer science to

94
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:48,190
continue to teach it which I have some

95
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:49,959
time but I figured I'd get on that train

96
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:53,109
early by taking like discrete math and

97
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:55,330
hopefully JavaScript next and then the

98
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:58,300
second link that I have up here it kind

99
00:03:55,330 --> 00:04:00,250
of goes by state by state and it's a

100
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,690
spreadsheet of what states have done or

101
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,640
what they're currently working on or

102
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:05,170
what they haven't done yet so like I

103
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,500
said you see a lot of yeses up here but

104
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:09,850
you also see a lot of nose and every

105
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,470
state is different with their public

106
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:14,709
education every state is different with

107
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:17,048
how they legislate funding and stuff so

108
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:18,910
this is kind of a good resource if

109
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:20,440
you're looking to see well what has my

110
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:22,630
state done or what has my you know

111
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,100
hometown done done in regards to

112
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,370
computer science this may be a good

113
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:30,530
place to start

114
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:37,270
all right so let's get back to the

115
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:39,710
slideshow not clear sight current slide

116
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:43,010
all right all right and it did it again

117
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:45,500
yay let's go there we go I'm so getting

118
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:48,550
into some national security education to

119
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:51,530
do with the focus in computer science

120
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:54,050
like security education is a must

121
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:56,270
especially being from Maryland there is

122
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:58,340
a need with being so close to DC in the

123
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:00,979
DMV area with all the contractors and

124
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:02,539
all of the companies popping up I know

125
00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:04,580
our state is have our standards are

126
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:06,260
heavily focused with cyber security as

127
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,760
it's a-- dubbed because parents and

128
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:11,210
educators like the term cyber security

129
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:12,710
better than you know hacking Soho the

130
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,780
national initiative for a cybersecurity

131
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:17,500
education are nice they have been going

132
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:22,940
into conferences and working with

133
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:24,080
educators in trying to I guess figure

134
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,760
out standards and what the framework

135
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,830
looks like for security education and

136
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,740
kind of what it looks like a K through

137
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:33,050
12 cyber security workforce framework

138
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,430
that's another one they are more on the

139
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:37,550
professional side of things but they're

140
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:40,100
getting into more higher education and

141
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:42,560
high school education and kind of seeing

142
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:45,349
you know working with the the pipeline

143
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,580
so to speak national initiative for

144
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:48,620
cyber careers and studies they're also

145
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:50,000
more geared towards higher education but

146
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:52,910
they're starting to push into high

147
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,639
school the National Cryptologic Museum

148
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:57,260
they are creating a new center called

149
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:59,900
the cyber center for education

150
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:02,210
innovation and they are currently

151
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,770
building a new building for the cripple

152
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:07,460
logic museum and in that building is

153
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:08,870
going to house the the CCEE I where

154
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,120
they're creating cybersecurity education

155
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,590
for primarily high school right now but

156
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,860
they will they will focus on middle

157
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:17,599
school or so they've said and then comic

158
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,280
B which is something I found out about

159
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:22,729
at B sites charm when I gave a very

160
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:26,780
abbreviated version of this talk they

161
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:28,639
are a company that is creating online

162
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:30,229
curriculum where it's kind of a

163
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,150
choose-your-own-adventure like comic

164
00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:34,820
style story where middle school students

165
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:36,979
can kind of choose you know face another

166
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,750
decision like security stuff

167
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:41,420
and then it teaches them about like

168
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:45,850
safety online and and everything and I

169
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:48,230
haven't had a chance personally to like

170
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:51,290
to kind of experiment this comic feed it

171
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:52,030
seems like a really good resource all

172
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,930
right

173
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:55,760
so there's also a lot of

174
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:57,920
capture-the-flag competitions popping up

175
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,810
for high school middle school students

176
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:02,900
Piko CTF which is one of the bigger ones

177
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:04,520
I know there's a bunch of high school

178
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:07,340
teams in my district that are looking at

179
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:09,500
PQ CTF for next year and then

180
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:11,270
CyberPatriot is another one we do have a

181
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:14,300
couple CyberPatriot teams in my district

182
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:16,340
for high school us cyber challenge

183
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,990
that's another one gen cyber which is

184
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,020
geared a little bit more towards like

185
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:22,280
freshmen and middle school students

186
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:25,039
Neverland CTF which is something I

187
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:28,669
discovered via Twitter and my little CTF

188
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:30,170
team kind of competed it in and they

189
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:32,510
absolutely loved it

190
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:34,070
they also found out that there's movie

191
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:37,849
exists called hackers that was a fun

192
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:39,050
talk with them also know don't tell your

193
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:40,640
parents I Miss Smith said the watch

194
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:43,610
hackers for homework please don't I will

195
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:46,010
not I will not support that and then

196
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:48,290
another local one that is in central

197
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:50,960
Maryland is a magic that they are a stem

198
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:54,470
nonprofit that is working towards like

199
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,900
how that puts on hackathons and has CTF

200
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:58,280
and they have a lot of in-person CTS but

201
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,560
you can also compete in them digitally

202
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:03,500
which is really cool and I brought a

203
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,120
team one was happening at our local

204
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,740
library in the county and I brought a

205
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,120
team there and they had absolute blast

206
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,950
they were really excited to get over a

207
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:14,750
thousand points so you've got to start

208
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:16,849
somewhere so as I'm going through

209
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:18,950
computer science and like learning about

210
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:21,770
all the security initiatives there seems

211
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:24,260
to be a problem that I kind of saw when

212
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:26,240
I started this journey there's lots of

213
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:28,130
development for high school courses

214
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,290
there's lots developing post-secondary

215
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:32,120
education whether you know a student

216
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:34,310
goes into trade school in two-year

217
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,140
four-year university or goes where I try

218
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:38,059
to goes right into the industry because

219
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,319
some districts especially in my County

220
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:41,329
we have a Career and Technology Center

221
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,280
where students can go and get different

222
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:45,650
certifications before they even graduate

223
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:48,980
high school so that's a track that they

224
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:50,600
can choose and you know there's a lot of

225
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,930
focus on classes and credentials i

226
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,970
underst

227
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,900
you know trying to get those high school

228
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:55,550
students early because high school

229
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,439
students are starting to figure out what

230
00:08:55,550 --> 00:09:00,400
they want to do where they want to go

231
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,720
their path after you know they graduate

232
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,329
but there's there seemed to be the

233
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,340
little to no resources for middle school

234
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:09,110
which is what I primarily teach I

235
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:11,390
usually get the answers poets in

236
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:12,800
development or we're working on it and

237
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,970
you're like oh that's great but what if

238
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,849
I want to teach it now

239
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:18,350
a lot of it those focus on basic digital

240
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:19,880
literacy lessons which are now being

241
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:22,970
pushed more towards elementary school

242
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:24,830
education or very simple definitions of

243
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:26,000
like this is what a hacker is and

244
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,950
sometimes you see the you know

245
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,570
stereotypical hoodie picture and the bag

246
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:34,490
typing and you're like okay so how do i

247
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:36,590
I kind of just thought like how do i

248
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:38,600
impart security education to my students

249
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:39,500
I want to teach this where do I start

250
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,960
what do I do

251
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:45,410
just thinking about this and then I get

252
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:46,880
an idea why don't I just kind of Creek

253
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:49,189
cobble together and create my own

254
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,689
security education unit and see what

255
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:52,670
happens with that if it doesn't work out

256
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:56,450
I never have to do this again if it does

257
00:09:52,670 --> 00:10:00,110
well then I have something so to kind of

258
00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:04,130
go back to more of my teaching style and

259
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:05,780
my teaching philosophy I teach seventh I

260
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:08,120
teach sixth seventh and eighth grade

261
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:10,760
tech ed at my school and I teach the

262
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,380
elective courses so my sixth grade class

263
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,730
is more of an exploratory course my

264
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,290
seventh grade class is actually the

265
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:18,860
computer science course my eighth grade

266
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:22,219
class is a pre engineering course so I

267
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:24,620
kind of end of the philosophy of what's

268
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:26,600
called blended learning and to kind of

269
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:30,560
define that is combining educational

270
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:32,480
technologies with like more traditional

271
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,329
teaching strategies to kind of

272
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,950
personalize classroom learning and have

273
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:38,870
students kind of take back control of

274
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:40,900
their learning not necessarily me always

275
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:43,790
lecturing about this is what Python is

276
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:46,400
but then actually doing it them actually

277
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:49,790
you know getting in there and creating

278
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:51,050
projects it's student I have a form of

279
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:55,370
reliever a student choice you know

280
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:57,020
within reason and um in my class there's

281
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:58,790
room for failure so if a program doesn't

282
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:00,500
work or if they don't get the right

283
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:02,750
answer right away like that's okay as

284
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,450
long as they don't you know keep failing

285
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:07,420
every assignment then we may have a

286
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:10,480
problem there but you know having that

287
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:12,099
that idea it's okay to fail and to learn

288
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,910
from that failure goes a long way with

289
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:17,650
kids confidences in class and then like

290
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:19,150
I said it's just combining new models

291
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:20,410
with you know kind of the old

292
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:22,530
traditional lessons and how we would

293
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:24,610
teach so that's kind of how what I teach

294
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:26,319
you know blended learning through all my

295
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:28,180
classes and especially for my seventh

296
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:33,130
grade class blend in computer science

297
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:34,689
because I feel like my I guess lack of

298
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:36,490
education in computer science or in the

299
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:39,640
field shouldn't hold back a student who

300
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:41,080
can really excel and if I don't know the

301
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:43,000
answer I'll find someone who does and

302
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,350
that not I know not all teachers think

303
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,700
that way like they think that they have

304
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:48,430
to be the one that knows everything and

305
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:50,200
sometimes it's okay to admit you don't

306
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:52,569
know something in class and say I'll go

307
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,950
find a resource or call up my husband

308
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:55,960
mr. Smith who is a software engineer and

309
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:58,390
maybe he can figure out where my dad who

310
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:01,600
works with computers and security and

311
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:03,130
stuff so my class in seventh grade is

312
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,560
called computer science investigations

313
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:08,260
or CSI for short yes that was done on

314
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:10,510
purpose teachers you know we have a plan

315
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:13,750
here and this is the last year was the

316
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:19,090
first full implementation of this the

317
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:20,500
previous year I was I was in the kind of

318
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:23,830
like the guinea pig class where I tested

319
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:25,420
the lessons out and then like last year

320
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:28,000
was the first full year when we went

321
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:29,650
through this countywide so my first

322
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,600
semester I always do programming first

323
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:33,100
just because that's where they get a lot

324
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,560
of those computational thinking skills

325
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:38,680
and a lot of problem-solving skills and

326
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:41,380
I let the students pick their

327
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:43,689
programming language so the first year I

328
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:45,370
had AI was it was kind of everywhere

329
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:47,680
with JavaScript and blockly and scratch

330
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:49,230
and Python and I kind of went nuts but

331
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:53,290
they learned a lot which is good and

332
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:54,730
each each language had a lesson sequence

333
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:56,469
and then there would be a final unit

334
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:58,420
project for that particular language and

335
00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:00,550
in the second half of the year I kind of

336
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:03,729
dubbed applications where they kind of

337
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:05,439
applied those what they learned in the

338
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:06,880
first half of the year to the second

339
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,580
half so like robotics there was a

340
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,990
research project we did data and

341
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,940
encryption and then security education

342
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:15,640
or cyber security as its dubbed in the

343
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:17,410
curriculum towards the end of the

344
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,610
here just in case like something

345
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:21,100
happened I was like well it's the end of

346
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:26,350
the year but I kind of read it at a time

347
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:29,530
with that so this year I decided to kind

348
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:32,560
of pare down the languages I also had a

349
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:35,980
my classes grew in size so I went from

350
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,930
having you know like 28 kids last year

351
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,430
to this year having 30 for starting out

352
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:41,680
school year which is always fun in a

353
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:43,510
tiny computer lab so I kind of had to

354
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,949
pare down like the choice of languages

355
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:46,720
but we still had a great time with

356
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:48,640
Python scratch and you know blockly

357
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:54,490
which is like the egg dub the code word

358
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:56,380
language and then I decided to start the

359
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:58,120
security education unit earlier like

360
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:59,740
after winter break

361
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,730
just because my classes they're kind of

362
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,530
getting fatigued with all the

363
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:03,970
programming and they kind of needed

364
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:06,280
something different and then that

365
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:07,660
carried over into the second half of the

366
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:10,030
year which I was like yeah I'm gonna get

367
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,740
through everything and then the winter

368
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:15,100
happened with snow ice delays and

369
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:17,860
closings and I was like great but I

370
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:19,210
ended up with that moving photography

371
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:21,940
into the data encryption unit which

372
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:23,620
worked out really well and currently my

373
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:25,720
classes are at the end of the year

374
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,250
project where they they pick a final

375
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,310
project based on something that we've

376
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:32,590
learned in one of these units the most

377
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:34,930
common one this year was the Edison Lego

378
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:37,660
BattleBots which I kind of should have

379
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:39,550
probably known that would be really

380
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:44,380
popular kids they're like yes BattleBots

381
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:46,089
let me break things whoo but yes so

382
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:48,580
that's what my classes look like now the

383
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:50,410
actual unit sequence I'm gonna get into

384
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:53,020
more details about the actual unit

385
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:55,510
lessons but I always start off with a

386
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:56,620
white hat hacker code and we talk about

387
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:59,050
the difference between white hat black

388
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:00,730
hat gray hat and I make sure to send

389
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:03,219
this from a shed permission slip home

390
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:04,870
you know like at least a week or two

391
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:07,570
before I start the unit just to make

392
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:10,390
sure it's all in parents are okay with

393
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:13,570
this you know and you know I don't get

394
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:16,420
fired for any reason and also we go over

395
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:18,310
the rules and expectations and what to

396
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:20,469
do and what not to do kind of the

397
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:22,000
spider-man ethos of with great power

398
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:23,410
comes great responsibility I'm pretty

399
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,770
sure that's in my slideshow when I talk

400
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:28,959
about this and the kids really you know

401
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:29,740
they regardless of how they actually

402
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,410
behave they really

403
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:34,000
kind of adhere to that which is good and

404
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:35,319
then I have I start off with a

405
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,590
pre-assessment called the security

406
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:41,140
breakout edu that I created and breakout

407
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:43,450
edu is kind of like a CTF slash escape

408
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:45,850
room but really pare down for students

409
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:48,160
um and there's all kinds of breakout you

410
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:50,410
to use for all kinds of subject areas so

411
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:54,819
I create a one based on the stuff that

412
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:56,770
we do in the unit and that seemed to

413
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:58,900
work out really well too one kind of

414
00:15:56,770 --> 00:16:00,760
gage frustration levels to see what they

415
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:02,050
already know some some students have

416
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,380
parents in the industry and they already

417
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:07,030
know like lots of more stuff than I do

418
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:09,640
to see if they actually know what social

419
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:11,620
engineering is or they you know know

420
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:13,780
maybe are how to brute-force something

421
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:15,130
and we do a reflection with that there's

422
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:16,750
a reflection sheet that says all right

423
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:18,220
how many did you get on your own how

424
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:20,560
many did you get with some help from the

425
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:22,180
Smith myself or another classmate or how

426
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,949
many did you not understand it just were

427
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:26,229
like I'm I'm just gonna skip over this

428
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:28,350
and the students are really honest about

429
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:31,450
that ask some really good questions

430
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:34,390
obviously I get if you attend a J Smith

431
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:36,640
talk earlier today I get the occasional

432
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:39,130
is this what it's like in the movies and

433
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:43,000
you're like yeah no maybe so him

434
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:44,950
depending alright so let's get into it

435
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,960
so we start off with passwords and

436
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:49,870
personal personal identifiable

437
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:51,700
information or PII and for this lesson

438
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:53,620
module I do what's known as a station

439
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:56,860
rotation and I've done this two ways

440
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:58,810
here I did as I put my students in

441
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:01,060
groups I grouped them up and they had

442
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:04,750
time limit and they did each station in

443
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:06,909
with burn activities and I didn't create

444
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:09,250
this from scratch I adapted a lot of

445
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:11,320
this lesson module from the e FF

446
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:13,180
security education companion which I

447
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:16,149
love the e FF for for having somewhere

448
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:17,830
you know resource wise to start so I

449
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:21,400
took a bunch of those lessons economy at

450
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:22,869
a station rotation for my students and I

451
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,580
have for those four stations are

452
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:26,469
brute-forcing in PII which is something

453
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:29,050
that I talk about and like do a mini

454
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:30,970
lecture so to speak and we look at one

455
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:32,919
of the images from the pre-assessment

456
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:34,480
and we identify what potential passwords

457
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,970
could be could have been exposed on the

458
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:40,240
social media web page what potential PII

459
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:41,710
could have been actually once they get

460
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,720
going they start to realize like wow

461
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:45,330
this person

462
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:49,139
well fictitious person put a lot of fun

463
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:50,580
here from eyes there then we look at

464
00:17:49,139 --> 00:17:52,439
password managers and password strength

465
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:55,918
like what's a good password versus a bad

466
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,269
password why a whole jumble of crazy

467
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:01,139
letters may not be the best thing for

468
00:17:57,269 --> 00:18:02,970
them all the time also remember we will

469
00:18:01,139 --> 00:18:05,250
get to a company analysis which is one

470
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:09,269
of the lessons from the ef-s security

471
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:10,320
companion and they they really like are

472
00:18:09,269 --> 00:18:10,590
interested in that they're like wait a

473
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,070
minute

474
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:16,110
like twitch doesn't have this or like

475
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:18,928
you know Netflix doesn't have that so it

476
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:21,629
kind of makes them think about the the

477
00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:23,340
online services and the websites and the

478
00:18:21,629 --> 00:18:26,580
apps that the use and they go to with

479
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:28,980
which secure app is this actually and

480
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:30,710
then we do multi-step authentication you

481
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:33,269
know what's the best for what situation

482
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:39,240
and then the assessment for this lesson

483
00:18:33,269 --> 00:18:39,690
module oops go back sorry I did not mean

484
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,019
to do that

485
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:47,370
where was that and there we go start

486
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:51,480
slideshow Oh cards light sorry about

487
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:54,389
that and it's gonna do that thing there

488
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,830
we go so the analyze they have a client

489
00:18:54,389 --> 00:18:57,799
they're in I put them in groups and

490
00:18:55,830 --> 00:19:01,049
they're in their own little security

491
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:02,940
company and they have a client WT Pugh

492
00:19:01,049 --> 00:19:05,668
who was hacked don't know and all social

493
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:08,250
media accounts have been compromised and

494
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:10,259
I had a bit of fun with this with some

495
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:12,450
of the things and they have to analyze

496
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:15,659
the images or the social media pages

497
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:17,039
that for potential PII are passwords

498
00:19:15,659 --> 00:19:19,620
that could've been exposed like on this

499
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:22,379
one here where mr. Pugh says he usually

500
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:23,879
use short ones like honey five and then

501
00:19:22,379 --> 00:19:26,039
they create a presentation to present to

502
00:19:23,879 --> 00:19:28,439
the quote client which usually you know

503
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:30,000
I am looking at and they can either

504
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:34,110
choose to present you know in front of

505
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,690
the class or just to me and like what

506
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:39,049
happened where were the security flaws

507
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:41,220
and what's the client could do to

508
00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:42,259
safeguard themselves against this next

509
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:45,090
time

510
00:19:42,259 --> 00:19:47,639
where's mine else there it is and then

511
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:48,928
we get into malware and they do a little

512
00:19:47,639 --> 00:19:51,178
bit of malware research where they pick

513
00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:52,769
one type and they research it

514
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:54,690
they create a visual representation of

515
00:19:52,769 --> 00:19:56,820
that and I've done this two ways do you

516
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:59,489
know time whether the first time I did

517
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:02,369
this I created something called malware

518
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:04,619
Puppet Pals where my students yeah my

519
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:07,589
students had to create lunch bag puppets

520
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:09,449
and that was an experience and they had

521
00:20:07,589 --> 00:20:11,849
to create a public service announcement

522
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:14,399
to share with elementary school students

523
00:20:11,849 --> 00:20:16,428
to kind of warn them about the danger of

524
00:20:14,399 --> 00:20:19,289
a malware and how to protect themselves

525
00:20:16,429 --> 00:20:20,369
and I sent a few off to the local

526
00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:23,070
elementary schools and got some very

527
00:20:20,369 --> 00:20:24,928
interesting impact but like that year I

528
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:26,279
had a few theater kids and artistic kids

529
00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:28,019
in life who you know really loved

530
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:29,190
theater and art in my class and that was

531
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:30,809
a really great way to kind of showcase

532
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:34,080
their skills they were like yes this is

533
00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:36,389
my thing this is my jam and in this year

534
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,999
because of time and weather I had to

535
00:20:36,389 --> 00:20:40,559
kind of pare it down to an infographic

536
00:20:37,999 --> 00:20:42,179
still was the students really like to

537
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:46,469
make they they're like yes pictures

538
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:47,879
colors whoo and we kind of printed that

539
00:20:46,469 --> 00:20:49,739
we printed out like the really good ones

540
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:52,289
and post them around the school and like

541
00:20:49,739 --> 00:20:54,029
put them in the library so that works

542
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:56,489
out so I have two of those lessons up

543
00:20:54,029 --> 00:20:59,399
there which for whichever one fits the

544
00:20:56,489 --> 00:21:00,779
classroom the best social engineering

545
00:20:59,399 --> 00:21:03,389
one of my personal favorites because I

546
00:21:00,779 --> 00:21:08,429
feel like 75 75 percent of my hobby is

547
00:21:03,389 --> 00:21:10,498
social engineering so how I start this

548
00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:14,279
lesson module off is I actually started

549
00:21:10,499 --> 00:21:16,619
earlier I hand oh well first let me get

550
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:18,739
to the fact that I adapted this from the

551
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:21,928
security education companion again and

552
00:21:18,739 --> 00:21:26,219
from the social engineers that presented

553
00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:27,929
I know that was one of village when to

554
00:21:26,219 --> 00:21:30,119
which I was super excited about and

555
00:21:27,929 --> 00:21:32,249
really really it was really cool to see

556
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:34,769
the talks like live or not the talks the

557
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:36,210
calls I should say so I started there

558
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:38,070
because that's just a resource I knew

559
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:39,989
about and then once I actually looked

560
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:41,189
more at the security education gap and I

561
00:21:39,989 --> 00:21:44,279
was like oh there are lessons here thank

562
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:46,109
God so my priest man I actually create

563
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:48,869
actually do simulated phishing attack on

564
00:21:46,109 --> 00:21:50,639
my class and so far no student has ever

565
00:21:48,869 --> 00:21:53,820
figured out that it actually happens

566
00:21:50,639 --> 00:21:55,589
until I tell them afterwards which is

567
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:59,849
good and bad depending on you know how

568
00:21:55,589 --> 00:22:03,899
you take that but so usually hand out a

569
00:21:59,849 --> 00:22:04,710
paper survey about in my school we have

570
00:22:03,899 --> 00:22:07,500
like extra Reese

571
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:09,390
and time kind of built in so that they

572
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,370
can like choose an activity they want to

573
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:13,470
do based on like you know how they've

574
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:15,629
done during the term and stuff and so I

575
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:19,200
handed out a survey asking you know just

576
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:20,460
sometimes you know the security

577
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,630
questions that you would see maybe on a

578
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:23,299
website like what's your favorite color

579
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:25,950
where did you go to elementary school

580
00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:28,889
and then I get got into like their

581
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:30,419
favorite activities and then the

582
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:32,279
question that always gets them

583
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:33,870
regardless of the fact that they're

584
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:36,809
currently learning about cybersecurity

585
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:40,620
is do you want to play fortnight at

586
00:22:36,809 --> 00:22:42,629
recess and then all the red flags go out

587
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:46,529
the window the kids are like what for

588
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:48,149
night yes especially with my class this

589
00:22:46,529 --> 00:22:50,549
year which I'm pretty sure most of them

590
00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:52,408
play that game and it just so happened

591
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:54,299
this year that I also got new computers

592
00:22:52,409 --> 00:22:55,440
with updated graphics cards and my

593
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:57,840
computer lavenders like yeah these

594
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,370
puppies oh yeah they will definitely run

595
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,220
fortnight and so of course they were

596
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:06,120
like giving me everything they could to

597
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:08,700
make that happen and then a day after or

598
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:10,139
two days after depending then we

599
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,820
actually start the unit where I go sorry

600
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:14,279
guys there's no fortnight at recess and

601
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:16,289
after they go through you know they feel

602
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:17,580
betrayed they feel like this that why

603
00:23:16,289 --> 00:23:22,169
would you do that to us some Smith how

604
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:24,480
we trust you and then I go well someone

605
00:23:22,169 --> 00:23:26,789
who could be posing as me who you trust

606
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,890
could try to get your information and do

607
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:30,360
a phishing attack on you and then you

608
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:33,750
could hear a pin drop in the classroom

609
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:35,459
and they go oh okay gotcha and then

610
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:38,250
maybe then you know you kind of have

611
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:40,399
them so then the lessons there the mini

612
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:43,110
lessons there are three so I with the

613
00:23:40,399 --> 00:23:45,168
with the simulated phishing attack I do

614
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:47,580
the six principles of social engineering

615
00:23:45,169 --> 00:23:49,140
and usually I have these in what's

616
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:51,210
called a playlist format where students

617
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:53,039
have videos and then I kind of built-in

618
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:55,200
conferences where we I talk one-on-one

619
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:57,390
with the students and they learn about

620
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,590
the business six principles and then

621
00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:00,980
they come to me and we discuss what they

622
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:04,289
learned and then I hand them back there

623
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:06,840
they're sorry it just makes sure I'm

624
00:24:04,289 --> 00:24:08,730
good on time their survey and I grade

625
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,080
their survey based on how compromised

626
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:11,640
they would have been if it was a real

627
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,760
attack you know with different colored

628
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:17,210
stars some have three some have one or

629
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:19,330
two but every time I've done this

630
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:21,350
student has been compromised in some way

631
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:22,668
and we have there are really good

632
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:24,879
discussions that come with that and then

633
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:27,380
they kind of self reflect and analyze

634
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,330
their own survey and a lot of them

635
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:30,620
realized that as soon as I saw that for

636
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:32,330
tonight question I didn't think about

637
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:35,510
anything else and I really have to be

638
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:36,889
careful and what I read and then we go

639
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:38,120
over to attacks and techniques where

640
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:40,309
they make brochures to educate other

641
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,889
students and then we do threat modeling

642
00:24:40,309 --> 00:24:45,918
and risk assessment which I pull from

643
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:50,419
the education education companion we do

644
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:51,860
the sunglass one first and then they get

645
00:24:50,419 --> 00:24:53,419
to their assessment which is the

646
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:55,520
simulation prompts there again in

647
00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:57,559
different little cyber security company

648
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,260
groups and they have to do a threat

649
00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:03,740
model and risk assessment for a gaming

650
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:05,000
company called mist and they've been

651
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,980
getting it's kind of like they've been

652
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,990
getting some you know phishing emails

653
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:10,220
they've been getting some rear calls and

654
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:11,990
they just don't know what's going on so

655
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,860
they hire the group to kind of figure

656
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:15,799
out what's happening

657
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:17,120
and they make another presentation to

658
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:19,460
the client and they can choose the type

659
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:22,279
it could be a video it could be them you

660
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:25,250
know doing maybe a live skit of what how

661
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:27,860
that would go and they can present to

662
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:29,360
the class or me because teaching in all

663
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,918
my years of experience like there are

664
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,110
students who have legitimate anxiety

665
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:34,549
about coming up and speaking in front of

666
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:36,439
people and to always have that choice

667
00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:38,750
whether it's to me or they just make the

668
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:41,330
video and I view it later that goes a

669
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:42,980
long way with some kids you know this

670
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:46,639
isn't for the student that is like I

671
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:47,929
want to do that no worries but it's kind

672
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,000
of just a way for a student who does

673
00:25:47,929 --> 00:25:51,320
have a anxiety about it to kind of

674
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,909
present and display their learning

675
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:56,090
without having to stand up in front of

676
00:25:52,909 --> 00:25:56,240
the class doing pretty good in time all

677
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:57,289
right

678
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,110
photography another one my personal

679
00:25:57,289 --> 00:26:01,640
favorites and really a lot of students

680
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:03,168
really love and enjoy because it's a

681
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,640
puzzle they want to figure out and like

682
00:26:03,169 --> 00:26:07,130
what's the code and how does it work and

683
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,720
what's the key um so we do a lot of you

684
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:11,360
I just do a lot of basic introductory

685
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:14,929
research with this some basic history

686
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:16,729
because the high school classes that are

687
00:26:14,929 --> 00:26:19,549
in the curriculum in my district they're

688
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:22,279
hitting cryptography really like a lot

689
00:26:19,549 --> 00:26:24,200
and I don't want to overlap with what

690
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:26,510
information they're you know going to

691
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,190
teach students I try to really be

692
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:31,460
conscious of that like okay

693
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:32,840
the high school students doing verses

694
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:35,240
like what my middle school students will

695
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:37,370
do so we do a lot of basic stuff with

696
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,020
that and there are lesson modules I use

697
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:41,330
the code org lesson modules because they

698
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:43,730
actually break down like data encryption

699
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:45,080
and cryptography really well for

700
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:48,440
students and a lot of students this is

701
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:51,230
their first time getting into it so it's

702
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,970
a really good like starting point and

703
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:55,690
they kind of self select the puzzles

704
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:58,850
from those modules that they want to

705
00:26:55,690 --> 00:27:00,440
they want to try to solve and then I

706
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:03,439
have teacher created challenges I'm like

707
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,820
alright here's Miss mr. Nye you know use

708
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,110
a bunch of different ciphers I always

709
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,879
make sure to do different ones each year

710
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:09,169
so like they can't come back in eighth

711
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,990
grade to give their little brother or

712
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:14,960
sister like hey here's the answers keeps

713
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:16,940
it keeps it fresh and it's like they can

714
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,370
they can solve them at their own pace

715
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:20,840
and then I kind of challenge them to

716
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:21,949
create their own challenges so that they

717
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:24,500
can challenge other students or they can

718
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:28,700
challenge me so kind of like a two-way

719
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:31,490
road there and then current events now

720
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:33,590
the last part of this unit I tried to I

721
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:35,360
debated whether to do career research or

722
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:37,610
current events and other classes do

723
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,830
career research where security is

724
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:41,510
touched upon or it's one of the choices

725
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:44,149
they could do so I decided to go with

726
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:45,260
current events just because I know

727
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:47,720
students sometimes they don't

728
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:49,790
necessarily reading the news not maybe

729
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,850
their first thing that they do when they

730
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:54,110
wake up in the morning like some adults

731
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:56,510
so we discuss current events in class

732
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:58,939
I'll discuss some for warmup I know last

733
00:27:56,510 --> 00:28:01,280
year it was like Equifax I kind of hit

734
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:02,480
really hard this year it was Marriot and

735
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,050
I had a spoon go oh yeah I heard about

736
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,340
that

737
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:05,450
I'm kind of worried about my mom she

738
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:09,050
just stayed there recently for a

739
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:11,390
business trip and then I give a list of

740
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:13,010
events like different reaches and data

741
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:14,450
leaks and so on and so forth and they

742
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:16,280
choose one they researched a bit about

743
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:17,720
it and they create a presentation to

744
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:20,090
educate other middle-school students

745
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:22,310
because my classes are elected so not

746
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:24,020
every student either takes it or gets to

747
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:26,480
take it depending on how many sections

748
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:27,920
we run than the year and then again it's

749
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,280
another choice of presentation and

750
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:32,750
usually this one is pretty short because

751
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:34,460
last year I didn't even get to it this

752
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:37,760
year it was kind of cut short due to

753
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:40,840
time and weather and just the new start

754
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,700
of the term so

755
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:46,090
where does this leave us you know

756
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:48,190
because I work in education you all work

757
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:51,879
in cybersecurity or some form of it I I

758
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:53,410
assume we're security and um you know

759
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:55,410
collaboration is going to be a big

760
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:58,780
factor here for everybody involved

761
00:28:55,410 --> 00:29:02,260
sharing resources so my last slide has a

762
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:04,750
bitly link to a folder where I put put

763
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:06,370
everything there it's not as organized

764
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:08,740
as I want it to be just because of the

765
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:10,090
school year but I plan on organizing it

766
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:12,070
over the summer and putting more lesson

767
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:13,810
overviews into it so it's a little

768
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:17,050
easier to manage and read for other

769
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:19,330
people and sharing resources are really

770
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:21,610
important I'm a big believer in the

771
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:24,370
price of free which a lot of teachers do

772
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:26,889
you appreciate so I'm not asking for

773
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:28,090
money for any of this if and the link is

774
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:32,110
often one business card if you want to

775
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:33,490
grab one other teachers and you know

776
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:36,100
industry professional feedback is so

777
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:38,590
important especially with a button

778
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:41,139
curriculum like this because if we can

779
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:43,000
get it right from the get-go it'll be

780
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:44,530
awesome but sometimes you don't get

781
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,040
things right from the get-go and it's

782
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:50,320
sometimes it's very hard to change them

783
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:52,330
and I have shared these resources with

784
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,189
first just other teachers in my district

785
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:56,280
because they were like ok well what else

786
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:59,590
can you teach kids not just programming

787
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:01,180
and then I kind of shared these out and

788
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:02,560
some teachers have been doing just like

789
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,670
one or two lessons other teachers went

790
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,990
through the whole unit and they gave me

791
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:08,410
some great constructive feedback and

792
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:10,540
positive feedback and they in turn then

793
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:12,640
created their own lessons for their

794
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:15,370
classroom which is great so it's kind of

795
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,900
like if you have it teachers can use it

796
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:20,020
kind of if they build it they will come

797
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:21,670
mentality we also I also want to inspire

798
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:23,220
the next generation you know as teachers

799
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:25,810
that's what we want to do we want to

800
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:27,640
inspire kids to be the best they can be

801
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:30,040
and to make an impact on the world and

802
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,480
with security education no offense to

803
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:33,850
anyone in this room including myself no

804
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:35,650
one's getting any younger so we're going

805
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:36,909
to need a workforce that can

806
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:38,290
problem-solve that can have these

807
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:40,540
computational thinking skills that can

808
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:41,860
think outside the box and have maybe

809
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:45,250
some of the security knowledge already

810
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:47,110
in from their K through 12 education and

811
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:49,990
I'm also a big believer in security

812
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:52,990
knowledge for everyone

813
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:55,570
and that anyone and everyone can learn

814
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:57,790
this and use their education is going to

815
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:59,620
be a very big thing it makes everyone's

816
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:03,010
job easier when the user can kind of

817
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:04,989
identify a basic phishing attack and my

818
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:06,550
classes I don't know about every school

819
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:08,080
or district everyone's different but my

820
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:10,540
classes are homogeneous ly mixed so I

821
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,830
have students who are you know above

822
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:14,590
their reading level I have students who

823
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:16,030
are way below reading level and no

824
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:18,129
matter what all students can learn about

825
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:20,379
security education so I figure it's

826
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:21,790
gonna be one of those almost like - and

827
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:24,010
like really important skills that they

828
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:26,320
have to learn regardless of what they go

829
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:28,750
into it's just going to be become that

830
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,220
21st century skill that they need just

831
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:32,980
like problem-solving your computational

832
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:35,110
thinking professional development

833
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:36,190
because like I said teachers were coming

834
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:38,560
from different areas

835
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:39,790
there's I've yet to encounter a comp

836
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:42,790
sign major who goes yeah I want to go

837
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:45,879
into teaching first ooh yeah that

838
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:46,899
doesn't happen sadly or it maybe it

839
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:50,020
doesn't I just haven't met those people

840
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:52,540
yet but if there's a for educators

841
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:55,330
section in like a conference website or

842
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:58,270
maybe you know in a thing take website

843
00:31:55,330 --> 00:32:00,040
or nonprofit as if there's a section for

844
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:02,379
educators that we can just go to for

845
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:05,649
links of resources or actual resources

846
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:08,160
that really helps us because I'm kind of

847
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:10,750
peeing backing off of what J Smith said

848
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:12,580
teachers we have a lot on our plates

849
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:14,380
sometimes I'm pretty sure my plate is

850
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:15,639
broken on the floor somewhere I just

851
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:19,390
haven't found the pieces yet to put it

852
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:21,820
all back together and it's really tough

853
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:23,410
some I mean some teachers are sometimes

854
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:25,179
stand-in parents for students because

855
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:29,440
their home lives are that chaotic or

856
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:31,000
broken but if there's an for educator

857
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:35,140
section that just helps everyone out

858
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:37,720
greatly on education side maybe teacher

859
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:39,280
stipends for conferences or you know

860
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,660
tickets like I know there's a lot of

861
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,879
student tickets or scholarships that

862
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:44,560
some conferences do and I know not every

863
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,510
conference you know is a big conference

864
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:48,940
that can do that but if there's like

865
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:51,490
someone willing to like donate a ticket

866
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:53,710
for a teacher as well or you know

867
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:56,710
regardless of what they teach that goes

868
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:57,550
a long way to if they're any sort of

869
00:32:56,710 --> 00:33:00,270
help we can get

870
00:32:57,550 --> 00:33:00,270
that's great

871
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:07,330
also I also forgot about this on my last

872
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:09,158
slide but it's also I don't know if I

873
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:12,279
need to tell you guys but teaching not

874
00:33:09,159 --> 00:33:14,350
exactly the 60 year career option that

875
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:16,419
everyone wants to go into so some

876
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:18,309
teachers need to work though 2nd or 3rd

877
00:33:16,419 --> 00:33:19,809
jobs to make ends meet and that kind of

878
00:33:18,309 --> 00:33:21,428
scholarship stuff really goes a long way

879
00:33:19,809 --> 00:33:23,440
I'm very fortunate and privileged enough

880
00:33:21,429 --> 00:33:26,019
that I don't have to work during the

881
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,820
summer but a lot of teachers do so just

882
00:33:26,019 --> 00:33:30,489
kind of keep that in mind as you as we

883
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:33,879
kind of go forward with this and then

884
00:33:30,489 --> 00:33:35,980
mentoring and volunteering which I know

885
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:37,689
depending on the school and depending on

886
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:39,850
the district it can be different you may

887
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:41,379
have to go through volunteer training I

888
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:43,178
know in our district all parents and

889
00:33:41,379 --> 00:33:46,389
volunteers do regardless of what they do

890
00:33:43,179 --> 00:33:47,980
in the school but kind of a place to

891
00:33:46,389 --> 00:33:49,479
start you can contact the local Career

892
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:51,580
and Technology curriculum specialists or

893
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:53,590
coordinators and if they don't get back

894
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:55,149
to you because I know sometimes they

895
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:56,678
don't even get back to me on some things

896
00:33:55,149 --> 00:33:59,469
in a timely fashion just because of

897
00:33:56,679 --> 00:34:01,869
things that they do local teachers and

898
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:04,509
if you attended J Smith's talk I can't

899
00:34:01,869 --> 00:34:06,668
reference it enough or if you didn't get

900
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:08,949
a chance to watch maybe watch it talk to

901
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:10,409
him and his experiences because it's

902
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:12,460
also how you kind of market yourself

903
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:14,230
sometimes with some school districts I

904
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:16,000
know I'm the teacher in like sweet okay

905
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:17,649
I'll schedule you for like this week

906
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,909
whereas other teachers have a lot more

907
00:34:17,649 --> 00:34:20,290
on their plate or maybe don't

908
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:24,069
necessarily have the time or figure it

909
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:26,139
out and try to kind of quoting what he

910
00:34:24,069 --> 00:34:27,520
said always go for the teachers first

911
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:29,799
because administrators they'll just

912
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,940
forward it to us like hey this person

913
00:34:29,799 --> 00:34:31,839
contacted me and I think it'd be great

914
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,730
for your class

915
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:37,690
and sometimes they may or may not know

916
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:39,369
what exactly it is just depending if you

917
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:41,349
can volunteer to speak at a career day I

918
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:42,369
know our district has a few career days

919
00:34:41,349 --> 00:34:45,280
for high school and middle school

920
00:34:42,369 --> 00:34:47,230
students do that like kids will ask

921
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:50,159
questions they will be interested

922
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:52,210
there's genuine interest here regardless

923
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:54,970
also extracurricular activities you

924
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:56,859
could be a mentor for a CTF team if you

925
00:34:54,969 --> 00:34:58,899
can coach a CTF team if you could do a

926
00:34:56,859 --> 00:35:01,240
club after school or maybe even at the

927
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:03,609
local library a lot of libraries are

928
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:06,279
doing you know STEM clubs and stuff like

929
00:35:03,609 --> 00:35:07,509
that that goes a long way to that that

930
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,940
just really helps because they feel like

931
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:11,230
going forward with all of this education

932
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:12,410
initiatives and all these lessons being

933
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:15,200
created

934
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:17,149
are currently there or yet to be created

935
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,180
we really have to work together to make

936
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:22,010
sure it's the best it can be

937
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:24,020
so there's my information and I know I

938
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:26,089
have two schools on there on I currently

939
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:27,740
work at Brunswick middle school but I'm

940
00:35:26,089 --> 00:35:30,619
moving to the high school next year just

941
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:32,209
because um a position opened up where

942
00:35:30,619 --> 00:35:35,150
it's mostly computer science that I'm

943
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:37,400
teaching and there's also an advanced

944
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:39,520
computing course which is like I dub it

945
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,990
like the more red team hacking course

946
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,579
which I was like yes I want to teach

947
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:45,529
that and I'm kind of following my first

948
00:35:43,579 --> 00:35:46,609
set of computer science students much

949
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:48,349
too some of their design meant

950
00:35:46,609 --> 00:35:52,520
excitement and some of some of them are

951
00:35:48,349 --> 00:35:54,170
slightly dismayed but so I will be

952
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:56,420
leaving the middle school realm but I

953
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:57,950
feel like I have like laid a lot of good

954
00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:00,230
groundwork for other teachers to go and

955
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:01,759
run with things and there's my email

956
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:03,799
that's not going to change and there's

957
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,349
my twitter handle if you want to hit me

958
00:36:03,799 --> 00:36:07,849
up on the Twittersphere Espo's and then

959
00:36:06,349 --> 00:36:10,369
there's the resource link like I said

960
00:36:07,849 --> 00:36:11,450
it's also on my business cards but if

961
00:36:10,369 --> 00:36:14,359
you want to take a picture of the slide

962
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:16,129
and send it to whoever please do and

963
00:36:14,359 --> 00:36:29,779
looks like I have about eight and a half

964
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:32,240
minutes or so for questions yes okay so

965
00:36:29,779 --> 00:36:35,029
I've talked to some school programs

966
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,490
about potential STEM careers and kind of

967
00:36:35,029 --> 00:36:39,799
what it's like to work in the industry

968
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:41,569
is there any way to kind of just post

969
00:36:39,799 --> 00:36:43,849
your information as being open to

970
00:36:41,569 --> 00:36:45,200
talking do you know of any kind of lists

971
00:36:43,849 --> 00:36:47,270
where you could present that because it

972
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,770
can be quite a lot of work to contact

973
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:52,099
schools individually when they might not

974
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:55,038
have anyone right um there's nothing

975
00:36:52,099 --> 00:36:57,260
that I personally know of but if you

976
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:59,150
just have like a kind of like a default

977
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:00,559
email once you draft it you can just

978
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:02,000
kind of copy and paste it and change

979
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:04,910
around a few things and they just send

980
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,109
it off to whomever also if you have a

981
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:07,970
website where you can just post that

982
00:37:06,109 --> 00:37:09,348
information that might be a little

983
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:12,049
easier than personally individually

984
00:37:09,349 --> 00:37:14,180
going and contacting schools and stuff

985
00:37:12,049 --> 00:37:16,220
like that like I said teachers are

986
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:17,328
sometimes behind with technology a lot

987
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:20,808
of them are getting their first Twitter

988
00:37:17,329 --> 00:37:22,400
accounts for the first time you know so

989
00:37:20,809 --> 00:37:24,950
what will eventually catch up kind of

990
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,539
thing but yeah I don't know of any like

991
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:30,038
list

992
00:37:25,539 --> 00:37:31,599
nationally that would be would be the

993
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:36,309
thing I mean if somebody does that's

994
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:39,009
great and please tell me - yes oh there

995
00:37:36,309 --> 00:37:40,539
we go safe and secure online has one but

996
00:37:39,009 --> 00:37:42,819
most teachers have never heard of it

997
00:37:40,539 --> 00:37:44,079
yeah so I listed myself and I did the

998
00:37:42,819 --> 00:37:46,919
background check and all that and then

999
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:49,269
it never nothing ever came through so

1000
00:37:46,919 --> 00:37:51,759
thank you for that so there's something

1001
00:37:49,269 --> 00:38:00,669
but maybe it can be better right any

1002
00:37:51,759 --> 00:38:03,159
other questions yes if you run into that

1003
00:38:00,669 --> 00:38:05,919
have can I helped you get this so far

1004
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:08,889
just to share I mean I'm just I'm just

1005
00:38:05,919 --> 00:38:11,558
curious in your experience so I have a

1006
00:38:08,889 --> 00:38:14,589
lot like my administration has been very

1007
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:16,089
open to going hey I'm gonna do this is

1008
00:38:14,589 --> 00:38:18,339
that cool and they're like yeah sure

1009
00:38:16,089 --> 00:38:19,479
what exactly is that so half of it I I'm

1010
00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:20,859
blessed with the fact that my

1011
00:38:19,479 --> 00:38:23,229
administrators my assistant principal

1012
00:38:20,859 --> 00:38:26,109
and my principal are very open to a lot

1013
00:38:23,229 --> 00:38:27,879
of these like initiatives like when I

1014
00:38:26,109 --> 00:38:30,009
started my CTF team this year I just

1015
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:31,659
went hey so I'm starting an ethical

1016
00:38:30,009 --> 00:38:32,889
hacking Club like that's cool we're

1017
00:38:31,659 --> 00:38:34,119
gonna participate in CTS and they're

1018
00:38:32,889 --> 00:38:37,539
like yeah that sounds great what is it

1019
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:39,249
what hold on you said hacking and they

1020
00:38:37,539 --> 00:38:40,899
seem to be really open with that

1021
00:38:39,249 --> 00:38:43,839
so my administration has been a big

1022
00:38:40,899 --> 00:38:47,409
supporter of me my also my core

1023
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:48,880
curriculum coordinator and my curriculum

1024
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:50,679
specialists they have also been very

1025
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,769
supportive of like what I'm doing

1026
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:55,630
because I kind of piped up saying hey we

1027
00:38:53,769 --> 00:38:57,249
should teach computer science like this

1028
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:59,380
and not necessarily just focus heavily

1029
00:38:57,249 --> 00:39:02,348
on programming and so they kind of roped

1030
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:04,179
me in when I first got into CTE to kind

1031
00:39:02,349 --> 00:39:07,239
of help develop the computer science

1032
00:39:04,179 --> 00:39:09,549
stuff in for my district so they've been

1033
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:12,009
really big advocates for me as well if

1034
00:39:09,549 --> 00:39:14,019
I've ever needed anything and just other

1035
00:39:12,009 --> 00:39:16,089
teachers I guess just being receptive

1036
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:17,288
and giving constructive constructive

1037
00:39:16,089 --> 00:39:19,119
feedback throughout the county because

1038
00:39:17,289 --> 00:39:21,579
my County we kind of have professional

1039
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,719
days before during and after the school

1040
00:39:21,579 --> 00:39:26,199
year where we kind of get together

1041
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:27,339
discuss things and you know they like

1042
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:28,779
other teachers have been really

1043
00:39:27,339 --> 00:39:31,509
receptive and really supportive of that

1044
00:39:28,779 --> 00:39:33,279
so I've been very very blessed with that

1045
00:39:31,509 --> 00:39:34,989
kind of support system where I know some

1046
00:39:33,279 --> 00:39:37,749
schools and educators and administrators

1047
00:39:34,989 --> 00:39:38,890
are not like that and they're not as

1048
00:39:37,749 --> 00:39:40,808
supportive like I said

1049
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:42,609
every school district is different and

1050
00:39:40,809 --> 00:39:44,859
even public versus private is very

1051
00:39:42,609 --> 00:39:47,710
different and even public first charter

1052
00:39:44,859 --> 00:39:50,348
versus private is super different so if

1053
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:51,760
you can also be an advocate for maybe a

1054
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:53,470
teacher that doesn't necessarily have

1055
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,420
that support system and try to find

1056
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:58,480
those people who will listen that also

1057
00:39:55,420 --> 00:40:00,579
helps I hope that answered the question

1058
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:09,430
okay good any other thing comments

1059
00:40:00,579 --> 00:40:11,260
concerns questions musings yes so all

1060
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:14,319
the puzzles on Google are in Google

1061
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:16,240
Forms and my so my resources are there

1062
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:17,799
like I said it's not as organized as I

1063
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,049
would have liked it to be just because

1064
00:40:17,799 --> 00:40:23,019
of the chaos of the end of the school

1065
00:40:20,049 --> 00:40:25,750
year so I'll be kind of organizing those

1066
00:40:23,019 --> 00:40:27,490
more over the summer but yeah all my

1067
