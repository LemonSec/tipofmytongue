1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:06,390
we got we got one minute lists oh you

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:08,459
already recording let's go hey welcome

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:12,149
to Circle City Khan everybody thank you

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,620
for coming to my talk I'm Jay Smith this

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,570
is my first talk at a con

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:20,279
I have run workshops I've done other

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:22,350
stuff I'm pretty loud you'll see me

8
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:24,180
working security out there say hi please

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,090
you'll see my shirt it says tell me if

10
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,279
my talk sucked or rocked tell me it's a

11
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,109
good way to meet so this is reaching

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,840
teaching youth about cyber security if

13
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:35,399
anybody will let you as I was

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,160
researching how to give a talk I saw a

15
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:42,510
lot of advice on not using sun zoo

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:45,629
quotes so I so I did a little research

17
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:49,050
and I found sons brother Todd who had

18
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:49,860
some more obscure quotes and I think

19
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:55,589
he's pretty dead-on

20
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:57,539
I hate keys all right so this is me I'm

21
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,899
an army vet I studied psychology at U of

22
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:03,120
L that was before the U of L you know

23
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:06,420
I'm a self-taught web developer InfoSec

24
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,380
in 2015 and at least one or two you in

25
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,450
here because you just want to see what

26
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,429
this jerk looks like in real life that

27
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,380
was me at two years old but like I told

28
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:17,759
Danny I was far better looking then so I

29
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:20,640
just stick with it okay so a disclaimer

30
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,470
on this talk it's not a technical talk

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,909
where you're going to learn what you

32
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,970
need in order to get into schools and

33
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:27,750
talk to kids about cybersecurity because

34
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:30,000
everybody that I've reached out to

35
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,470
online and talk to has an entirely

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,509
different experience

37
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,658
school districts are completely

38
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:38,400
different in their requirements

39
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:40,920
hopefully some of the things that I've

40
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,630
struggled with may speak to you or give

41
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,990
you kind of an idea that's kind of the

42
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:47,310
idea this is I was really shocked by the

43
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:49,679
time I got through this little journey

44
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,680
of mine how difficult this could be and

45
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,659
I'll get into that a little bit oh

46
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,250
here's another one

47
00:01:53,659 --> 00:02:01,020
no it worked more of talk no I'm not a

48
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:03,630
big fan of his brother okay so here's

49
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:06,060
the landscape these are the the kind of

50
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:08,160
the the easy to understand reasons why

51
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,140
teaching kids about cybersecurity are so

52
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,959
important of course our industry has a

53
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:15,000
tremendous amount of need we know that

54
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,409
during my research I determined there

55
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,829
was between three and four hundred

56
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:22,439
million open jobs between now and the

57
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:26,670
rest of time so there's no telling but

58
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:28,439
everybody needs jobs job skills some of

59
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:31,260
the schools I've talked in they're

60
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:32,849
certifying kids in security plus network

61
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:36,989
plus a plus before they even graduate

62
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:38,819
high school just fantastic so for those

63
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:41,760
people whose learning style isn't

64
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:42,958
utterly suited to the usual University

65
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,328
type thing they can come out of high

66
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,329
school make $60,000 a year if they're in

67
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:51,780
the right market safety this is the one

68
00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:53,250
that spoke to me the most and I'll show

69
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,120
you in a second what gave me the idea

70
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:58,170
about this but so when I was a teenager

71
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,359
I saw wargames

72
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:04,018
I did everything he did in wargames

73
00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:05,489
because I saw it I apart my Commodore 64

74
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:07,920
and did everything I should not be doing

75
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:11,730
with that I destroyed my Atari several

76
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:15,599
times ColecoVision in television etc etc

77
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:18,119
etc had YouTube been around when I was a

78
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,940
teenager there is almost no doubt in my

79
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,349
mind I'd be in jail because if I saw it

80
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:27,569
and I thought I could do it I would do

81
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:29,668
it so it's really important to me to get

82
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:31,738
these kids early because of

83
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:34,709
neuroplasticity and that's where it gets

84
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:37,680
kind of heady and nerdy but there are

85
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:40,169
there's a lot of research that's it's

86
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,590
pretty solid about there being certain

87
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:45,569
milestones in life where whether it's

88
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:48,810
language acquisition music learning

89
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:50,488
language learning and computers it's

90
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:52,799
it's far more important to get that

91
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:54,900
stuff early it's far more difficult as

92
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,579
adults to just pick it up and I think

93
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,409
that's the main reason I've been so

94
00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:00,510
successful in self teaching and web

95
00:03:58,409 --> 00:04:02,548
development and information security is

96
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:04,858
because I was exposed to computers out

97
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:06,780
in California when I grew up at a very

98
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:09,389
young age we were coding in basic and

99
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,849
third grade and that's great I live in

100
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:13,379
Kentucky now we don't have that it was

101
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:16,560
all I could do to get my kids school to

102
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:17,668
start scratch which is something it is

103
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,329
something but they don't want to move

104
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:24,779
beyond that and start real programming

105
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:25,800
so that's a constant fight so I kind of

106
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:26,730
got ahead of myself a little bit

107
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,360
developmental plastic

108
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:31,980
and I do have some citations about it

109
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,950
again it's it's certain milestones in

110
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:38,190
life before which or during which it's

111
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:39,900
far easier for your synapses to actually

112
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:42,750
create those connections to learn

113
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:45,840
languages learn music and computers

114
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:47,790
because at the cortical level computers

115
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,830
are language you're putting together

116
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:51,950
you're taking ones and zeros and you're

117
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:55,050
making it make sense

118
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:57,860
so here's some nerd stuff

119
00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:00,780
heuristics these are beliefs that I have

120
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:04,070
based on my knowledge my experience and

121
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:07,830
and just what I've seen adult learners

122
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:10,590
it comes to learning music and this is

123
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:12,450
me trying to learn guitar as an adult

124
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:14,940
never having taken any music as a child

125
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:16,860
I couldn't do it could not do it could

126
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:19,740
not make the connection between my

127
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:22,170
fingers and the guitar fret D what it's

128
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,210
supposed to do I could I knew the chords

129
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:25,740
I could strum them and you could

130
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:28,560
probably figure out that it was crazy

131
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,960
train soon but it wasn't something you'd

132
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,530
ever want to listen to languages are the

133
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,870
same way there are certain sounds with

134
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:39,270
particularly with African tribes that

135
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:41,610
people make in their languages that we

136
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:44,219
are incapable of forming with our mouths

137
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:46,230
we cannot do it as an adult it's only by

138
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:49,050
being exposed to that stuff as a child

139
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:50,790
that you can actually do that and that's

140
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:53,700
why adult learners who have never been

141
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:56,220
exposed or most people have been exposed

142
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:58,740
to foreign languages in school but it's

143
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,660
been very minimal unless you really

144
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:04,800
don't and wanted to do it as an elective

145
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:06,780
every year like I did my son's school is

146
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,060
a perfect example they have one hour of

147
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:12,419
Spanish a week all through elementary

148
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:14,040
school it's pretty useless he doesn't

149
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:16,890
really know any Spanish whatsoever and

150
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,900
one to ten is pretty much his limits but

151
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:21,659
as an adult if he decides he wants to

152
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:23,580
pick up French Russian German Spanish

153
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,230
he's gonna have a much harder time than

154
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:28,979
kids who actually got a lot of exposure

155
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:30,390
to that early on anybody I would think

156
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,650
who has tried to learn a musical

157
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,570
instrument or learn a foreign language

158
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:35,549
as an adult using babble or using

159
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:37,409
something like that you'll struggle a

160
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:38,420
little bit but if you were a child that

161
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:43,370
got a lot of that I think

162
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:46,090
help you out so I got a respect to these

163
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:49,850
three guys right here after Derby con

164
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:52,609
2017 they created this website hackers

165
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:57,170
in education and this is what prompted

166
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:59,230
me to do this I'm not a practitioner I'm

167
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:02,770
not a professional and information since

168
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:05,030
security I'm I work in transportation

169
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:07,789
hacking and braking is just what I did

170
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:09,080
as a kid my day job is my day job that's

171
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:10,280
what I did when I got out of the army

172
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,590
and was I stuck with because it pays the

173
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:15,289
bills but I loved learning everything I

174
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:17,119
can about InfoSec so after Derby con I

175
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:19,700
actually met two of these guys there

176
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:23,090
they started hackers in education the

177
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:25,490
idea of the program being we need to get

178
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:28,070
in with local law enforcement and get in

179
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:30,440
with the schools and get in front of

180
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:32,570
kids now so that they understand this is

181
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,940
a viable career path and also for the

182
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:36,260
safety reasons I mentioned if they want

183
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:38,690
to learn it they're gonna learn it I

184
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:43,159
would we would all just rather they do

185
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:43,750
it in the right way no more more Todd

186
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:48,500
Zoo

187
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:49,820
he was feel a little salty that day okay

188
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,160
so assumption is the mother of all

189
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:55,370
mistakes this is a quote that most of us

190
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:58,670
know a little little bluer from under

191
00:07:55,370 --> 00:08:00,890
siege to Eric Bogosian but this is the

192
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:05,060
original quote that his colorful quote

193
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:07,310
came from so we belong to a Catholic

194
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:09,080
parish in Louisville because of our

195
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:10,790
neighborhood is there are a lot of

196
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,250
police officers in that parish from all

197
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:16,340
different jurisdictions in the area and

198
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:17,960
around it so I assumed because hackers

199
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:20,390
and education was a big part of it was

200
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:23,659
local law enforcement I mean no problem

201
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:24,890
just to call my friends so yeah they

202
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,480
were a little helpful in getting me

203
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:28,130
email addresses of people that handle

204
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,290
cybersecurity and community engagement

205
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:32,030
at the law enforcement level at the

206
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:33,409
district level those email addresses

207
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:35,929
went nowhere

208
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:37,250
they were never answered and my friends

209
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:38,599
are you know they have their own

210
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,820
responsibilities within the law

211
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,990
enforcement so and I you know I don't

212
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,840
want to wake up take up too much of

213
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:47,390
their time but I found you know this is

214
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:49,870
this is my first stop LMPD which is the

215
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:51,880
largest police force in Kentucky and

216
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:55,269
that's what happened

217
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:56,769
I got nowhere at all I and that was my

218
00:08:55,269 --> 00:09:00,790
first attempt so that was a year and a

219
00:08:56,769 --> 00:09:03,009
half ago security by obscurity they have

220
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:05,469
they have email addresses that are never

221
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:07,329
even monitored checked or answered they

222
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:09,069
just they're there I guess they're for

223
00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:10,989
vendors I'm not sure why they're there

224
00:09:09,069 --> 00:09:13,060
but I had to I had to get through to a

225
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:14,410
couple people to talk to him and say and

226
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,790
no this is your name and I know this is

227
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:18,240
an email address with your name on it

228
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:22,089
what's up I said no nobody checks those

229
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:24,459
awesome so next I'll go directly to

230
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:27,870
schools I coach a lot of kids at our

231
00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:29,739
school I feel like it's a product that

232
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:31,690
it sells itself

233
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm not looking for money I'm looking to

234
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:35,470
come into the school and talk about

235
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,839
careers in cyber education and safety

236
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:39,839
online safety seems like a no-brainer

237
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:50,050
defense-in-depth yeah so I had a lot of

238
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:52,138
challenges here I got with somebody who

239
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:55,420
handles business and IT track in

240
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:56,740
Jefferson County Public Schools and he

241
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:59,589
put me in touch with a couple of other

242
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:01,689
people and at the end of seven or eight

243
00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:03,339
interactions I was on the phone with the

244
00:10:01,689 --> 00:10:07,240
Regional Director of nice work out of

245
00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:09,490
Louisiana great I was spending a lot of

246
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:13,750
time and energy talking about what a

247
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:19,870
great idea this is without getting

248
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:22,779
closer to doing this it it was

249
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:25,350
frustrating because everybody I talked

250
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:27,610
to is yeah oh yeah that's a great idea

251
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:30,040
call so-and-so and we'll set something

252
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:31,240
up called sone so awesome that's awesome

253
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,519
you should give these five people

254
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,620
together it just kept on going and going

255
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,110
and that's why it said defense and death

256
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:40,389
it's a honeypot I was spinning my wheels

257
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:42,269
talking to people who ultimately were

258
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:48,160
not going to put me in a classroom

259
00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:52,180
talking about cybersecurity so I got

260
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:53,170
pivot go to the schools directly so then

261
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:55,060
I started doing a little social

262
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:57,819
engineering and finding it's and

263
00:10:55,060 --> 00:11:00,790
hundreds of teacher emails business

264
00:10:57,819 --> 00:11:02,319
teacher's computer teachers the few that

265
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:04,599
have cyber engineering tracks

266
00:11:02,319 --> 00:11:05,139
I sent them emails in addition to every

267
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,609
principal

268
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:08,829
assistant principals school counselor

269
00:11:06,609 --> 00:11:10,929
and anybody else who is ancillary to

270
00:11:08,829 --> 00:11:12,279
that even school resource officers who

271
00:11:10,929 --> 00:11:14,499
were in law enforcement to who might

272
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:15,850
think this is a good idea tons and tons

273
00:11:14,499 --> 00:11:24,369
up and go out and I started getting a

274
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:27,730
little bit of a response so I finally

275
00:11:24,369 --> 00:11:29,649
had a little bit of success and this was

276
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:31,989
after an entire year so another derbycon

277
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:35,410
had come in passed and I was still

278
00:11:31,989 --> 00:11:38,980
trying because it's just what I do

279
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:40,629
so a a young female Academy a high

280
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:43,779
school Academy in Louisville it's

281
00:11:40,629 --> 00:11:46,660
Catholic it's a private school responded

282
00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:47,230
and it was a teacher and she said yeah

283
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:50,769
absolutely

284
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:52,779
I have freshman classes of you know

285
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:54,279
ninth graders that you can talk about

286
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:56,040
whatever you want so I said so how about

287
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:58,209
online safety not sharing pictures

288
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,129
little stories about you know what's

289
00:11:58,209 --> 00:12:02,410
happened to people who have who have

290
00:12:00,129 --> 00:12:04,239
been groomed online things like that and

291
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:06,100
then I'll throw in a little career talk

292
00:12:04,239 --> 00:12:08,769
at the end of it because this particular

293
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:11,230
school doesn't have much of a computer

294
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:12,879
or cyber program so she said you're

295
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:15,610
probably talking to the wrong group if

296
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:22,149
you get heavy careers that's perfectly

297
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:25,499
fine I gave two talks of the course of a

298
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:29,980
week I hit 3/4 of freshmen in the school

299
00:12:25,499 --> 00:12:31,959
and then nothing and I was I was very

300
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:35,439
effusive with my follow-up my thank you

301
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:37,238
emails called the principal thanked her

302
00:12:35,439 --> 00:12:39,488
tremendously for the opportunity to talk

303
00:12:37,239 --> 00:12:40,749
to students very good friend of mine has

304
00:12:39,489 --> 00:12:42,610
a daughter who's a junior at the school

305
00:12:40,749 --> 00:12:44,860
so I had her do a little research and

306
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:48,029
just ask around like did he was it too

307
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:50,410
dark because some of that subject matter

308
00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:52,419
got a little dark

309
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:53,529
she said no the kids loved and I thought

310
00:12:52,419 --> 00:12:55,779
the kids loved it they were very

311
00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:58,389
interactive than a lot of questions and

312
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:59,589
that's as a little side note if and when

313
00:12:58,389 --> 00:13:02,139
you do get in front of students

314
00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:03,850
typically what I've towards the end

315
00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:05,829
where I've discovered the success is is

316
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:07,899
about 10 to 12 minutes of your career

317
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:10,479
slides and how to get into the field and

318
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:12,489
whatnot and then just QA and just let

319
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,749
them ask because they're gonna a lot of

320
00:13:12,489 --> 00:13:16,029
the class is going to ask the same thing

321
00:13:13,749 --> 00:13:17,739
you know which depictions and the movies

322
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:19,900
or TV is is the closest to the real

323
00:13:17,739 --> 00:13:22,760
thing of hacking

324
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:25,340
you know what if my friends Instagram

325
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:29,569
got in there and it's always you know

326
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:31,520
fix your password so I was I was really

327
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:33,290
perplexed by this because the teacher

328
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,930
when I was walking out on both occasions

329
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:38,030
and they really loved that was great

330
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:40,849
the principal thanked me while I was

331
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:42,740
there the students seemed to love it

332
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:44,090
I gave him a bunch of camera covers and

333
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,800
stickers and you know the usual hacker

334
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:47,300
swag that we have a little bit laying

335
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,240
around usually after these conferences I

336
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:54,439
just couldn't get it and it was five or

337
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:56,170
six weeks going on that I had no idea so

338
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,300
my friend whose daughter is a junior

339
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:02,240
posted on Facebook local businesswoman

340
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:03,859
who was an alumni of that Academy came

341
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:08,000
and gave the entire school pretty much

342
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:10,130
the same talk which you know she's a

343
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,770
businesswoman she's a she's an alumni of

344
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:14,090
this Academy and if there's not many

345
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:17,030
people here from Louisville but if you

346
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:21,200
are the Catholic school community it's

347
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:23,810
very tight with their connections so she

348
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:26,570
runs a marketing company but she's a

349
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:28,130
self-made businesswoman and she came in

350
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:30,230
and she talked to an entire high school

351
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:33,020
full of young ladies I can't be moan

352
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:36,140
that I just you know I at least I

353
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:37,819
learned a little bit so when I talked to

354
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:39,860
my friend's daughter again she said yeah

355
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,360
so-and-so went home and told her mom

356
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,710
about it her mom knew this woman who ran

357
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:47,290
this company she said well I'd like to

358
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:47,290
do that it is what it is

359
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:53,180
so this is where after a year in about

360
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:55,970
two months I had had gotten into two

361
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:58,400
high schools of constantly trying and I

362
00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:02,530
was starting to think yeah this is this

363
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:12,380
is starting to get like a waste of time

364
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:14,569
but I am persistent awesome so one thing

365
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:16,040
I did was I took my education and my

366
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:18,050
learning of what has been happening and

367
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:21,650
I wrote a CFP for Circle City College

368
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:22,849
this one right here I had never spoken

369
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,860
the conference before I did run

370
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:26,480
workshops here last year but that's kind

371
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:29,270
of what I do is I like I teach people I

372
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,240
do it my job to but doing my first talk

373
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:33,910
so I

374
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,589
pretty pumped about this because it's my

375
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:39,699
first talk I love this conference and I

376
00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:42,520
love the people who want it deeply so

377
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:46,930
the funny thing is not even two days

378
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:49,720
later teacher out of the blue don't even

379
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:50,949
remember sending him an email he's at

380
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,649
one of the other cat he's at a boys

381
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:57,339
Catholic school st. X in in Louisville

382
00:15:53,649 --> 00:15:59,410
two days later because now in my mind

383
00:15:57,339 --> 00:16:00,820
I've marketed myself as yes I have been

384
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:02,469
trying my butt off to get in these

385
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:04,180
schools and taught these kids and I

386
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:06,130
finally made it through two but I got

387
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:10,089
ghosted my challenges would be a great

388
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:14,470
talk talk accepted why don't you come

389
00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:19,240
talk to my class okay so you know I'm

390
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:20,500
not going to not do it this is me 45

391
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,089
minutes after my appointment to come

392
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,500
talk to his class sitting in the

393
00:16:22,089 --> 00:16:31,600
principal's office waiting for him to

394
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:35,140
come get me so yeah it's uh it's just

395
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:37,089
one of those things you know I was

396
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:40,180
getting frustrated but he's a teacher

397
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:41,230
he is a teacher and who knows what he's

398
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:44,430
got going on back there

399
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:48,520
at an all-boys Catholic High School and

400
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:51,279
sure enough when he came in he was very

401
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:53,260
upset that he was so late and-and-and he

402
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:55,899
had had to deal with an upset student

403
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:57,880
something's going on I am definitely not

404
00:16:55,899 --> 00:16:59,589
a higher priority than that and sure

405
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:02,290
enough he said you know if you've still

406
00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:04,030
got time my next class is coming in once

407
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:06,909
you just hit them up the junior a piece

408
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:10,329
sure but it doesn't matter to me and

409
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:14,290
that turned into an awesome talk and

410
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:17,379
this is just oh wow that got really

411
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:19,149
messed up well that sucks

412
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:21,189
that's alright Aaron Schwartz that's

413
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:23,199
what that's that's what's being uh so

414
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:25,630
these are everything we talked about and

415
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,400
it you don't have to you know and this

416
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:28,929
is where I got the idea so I gave him

417
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,480
the slide presentation because we were a

418
00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:33,309
little rushed we only had about 40

419
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,410
minutes in their class section gave them

420
00:17:33,309 --> 00:17:36,910
a slide presentation I said what do you

421
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:38,890
guys interested what are you interested

422
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:41,650
in and this is they were asking

423
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:43,660
everything the deep web tour all that

424
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:47,020
stuff do I really have to go to college

425
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:48,190
if I want to do this no your parents are

426
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:50,910
spending sixty thousand on high school

427
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:54,100
send me when you go to college anyway

428
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:59,770
the same you don't but don't tell them I

429
00:17:54,100 --> 00:18:03,100
told you you don't so now what do I do

430
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:05,770
I've given one talk at say next the

431
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,540
teacher was very very happy with it of

432
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:09,370
course they had finals coming so they

433
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:12,250
get very busy and that's one thing I

434
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:13,928
learned is teachers have a lot of

435
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:16,660
demands on them they don't have a lot of

436
00:18:13,929 --> 00:18:21,070
free time to figure out how to work you

437
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:23,200
in and I found them and I'm finding I'm

438
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:26,320
not getting the reach so the response is

439
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,929
fantastic the students at both Mercy

440
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,909
Academy in st. X Academy they loved it

441
00:18:28,929 --> 00:18:34,870
and you can tell you can tell if they're

442
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:36,610
checked out so the product is solid why

443
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:41,949
can't I sell it because I'm selling it

444
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:43,300
for nothing so I got a pivot again good

445
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,900
friend of mine very good friend of mine

446
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,760
I was

447
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,919
we're selling I'm talking away too fast

448
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:51,520
I apologize very good friend of mine

449
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:54,010
named Bob Bob is kind of the anti me in

450
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,320
that he he's he runs some kind of

451
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:57,400
mortgage business so he only eats what

452
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,610
he kills as they call it

453
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:02,440
he is a Salesman through and through

454
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:04,659
he's the kind of person that if you're a

455
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:09,400
practitioner you probably had sales is

456
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:11,260
here marketing but having talked to the

457
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:15,040
to my friends and a lot of people in the

458
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:17,679
community trying to get to get this done

459
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:19,600
in some way I had been getting the same

460
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,490
message everybody had the same confusion

461
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,168
yeah what kid doesn't want to hear about

462
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:26,080
this hacking is cool

463
00:19:23,169 --> 00:19:29,410
hacking careers are awesome you can make

464
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:31,720
great money you cannot go to jail no

465
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:33,700
downside so I so I said you know what

466
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,410
I'm gonna talk to Bob about it and he

467
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:38,620
and I had a few beers and a few more and

468
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:40,360
then after he just let me listen or he

469
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:42,489
just listened to me let me spew on his

470
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,899
field at the end of it he goes man he

471
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:45,730
said there was a lot of that stuff over

472
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:48,370
my head so I can tell you're passionate

473
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:51,130
about it and I can tell you know it but

474
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:52,770
you're not marketing it and you know of

475
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:56,400
course my face

476
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:59,010
what I'm gonna market it we don't like

477
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,350
marketing we're hackers we want real we

478
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:03,540
don't want to be sold as a community if

479
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:04,919
we are being sold something or is too

480
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,300
shiny on the outside we're gonna dig

481
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,760
under and find out what's real on the

482
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:12,870
inside so it's kind of the antithesis of

483
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:14,700
what we do but he told me he gave me he

484
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:15,928
said look you're just reaching out to

485
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,950
all these teachers you're shotgunning

486
00:20:15,929 --> 00:20:19,860
all over the world and you're just

487
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:22,520
saying hey what can I do for you he said

488
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:26,040
do this instead tomorrow

489
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:28,620
send an email out again just say hey May

490
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:30,649
25th 26th and 27th I'm free from 1:00 to

491
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:33,479
3:00 p.m. or whatever days you want

492
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:35,460
which which classes you know what

493
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,140
teachers have time for me and I send it

494
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,970
to the guy at 2 JCPS at the public

495
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,980
schools I'll be damned

496
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:42,540
if one hour later I didn't have

497
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,340
appointments at three high schools to

498
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:49,470
talk to them after a year and a half

499
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:51,689
so not only success which is awesome but

500
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:54,929
then I also have to go back to Bob say

501
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:57,840
you're right man I had actually had to

502
00:20:54,929 --> 00:21:00,480
consider my audience as opposed to

503
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,639
assuming that my product was so great

504
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,650
that you couldn't not let me in your

505
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,870
classroom and that's what that's really

506
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:09,929
where the place where my challenges came

507
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:11,850
from was thinking that the content was

508
00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:14,190
so good and the fact that I wasn't

509
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:17,809
charging you for it well you're just

510
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,809
dumb for not asking me in your class

511
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:25,770
yeah I tried I mean I I was like yeah

512
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:27,660
I'll put in a quote about marketing here

513
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:30,540
that's really relevant makes god there's

514
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:36,390
a it's it's easy to hate marketing how

515
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:38,940
about so so here's where the story it

516
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:40,770
we've hit the high point and I've got

517
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:42,660
this this really awesome I've got all

518
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:46,320
these appointments in the public schools

519
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:49,440
and over the course of two weeks I spoke

520
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,669
in five public schools to every grade

521
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,940
level and I got to learn some things

522
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:54,960
from there to don't bother with freshmen

523
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:58,020
probably don't bother with sophomores

524
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:02,220
juniors are engaged seniors are all in

525
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:03,840
and that makes sense but yeah I got five

526
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,850
different schools I got to see all their

527
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,020
different cyber engineering programs or

528
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:09,540
computer programs

529
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:11,910
lack of computer programs I got this I

530
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:13,470
got and these didn't even count to pup

531
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:15,690
the private schools so these were the

532
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:16,860
public schools so then the private

533
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:19,650
school teacher is saying acts high

534
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:22,409
school while I was doing this because of

535
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:24,270
course when it rains it pours he

536
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:26,190
contacted me again and he said hey my

537
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:27,990
juniors are done with their AP testing

538
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:29,790
next week and I've got two weeks of

539
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:33,620
nothing until the end of the year

540
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:36,330
watching movies and whatever of course

541
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:41,070
this is this is $16,000 a year tuition

542
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:42,570
right there he said if you've got the

543
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:44,970
time however many days you want to come

544
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:47,490
in whatever you want to do right that's

545
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:48,480
what I was looking for so I can go in

546
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:50,310
there and basically show off the

547
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:54,990
teenagers and and get them excited about

548
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:56,610
cybersecurity so I did I spent five two

549
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:58,800
hour blocks with them over two weeks

550
00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:02,280
before school got out and we did

551
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:05,159
everything we did onion scanning we did

552
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,870
some social engineering on ourselves we

553
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:09,990
did you know some Facebook security

554
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:12,270
stuff like that we we even D off you

555
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:14,220
skated some images and it they loved it

556
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:17,670
they chewed it up they just ate it they

557
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:21,720
loved it so I was right in the beginning

558
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:23,640
as I as I keep mentioning that the

559
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:27,000
content there was nothing wrong with it

560
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:28,740
the product itself sells itself so the

561
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,320
title of the talk how to reach and teach

562
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:33,810
kids about cybersecurity teaching them

563
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:35,370
isn't easy they want to know it and

564
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:39,720
we're not wrong in thinking that this

565
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:42,540
product is super awesome and they want

566
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:44,100
careers in it it's how to get in and

567
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:47,280
that's what we have to assume is we have

568
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:48,990
to come in and from a place where eating

569
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,180
our pride a little bit and understanding

570
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:54,590
that teachers educators at every level

571
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:56,700
have so many demands and so many little

572
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:59,429
it's like that little grid on your

573
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,840
github there's this all green and they

574
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:05,880
just have to wait for one to turn white

575
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:08,100
for you to stick in there yeah that was

576
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,360
just me playing around on canva and I

577
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:11,689
don't like that guy so I'll put a helmet

578
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,689
on his head

579
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:19,679
so be cut and and that has led to more

580
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:21,300
now I'm on one board

581
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:23,340
at one of the public schools to help

582
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,840
them pivot off of their cyber

583
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:28,590
engineering and create a cybersecurity

584
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:30,600
track at one school which is great I'm

585
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:33,000
gonna work more with the one private

586
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:35,250
school next year he's looking to move

587
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,240
away from I think they're coding and

588
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:39,300
xamarin or something they're doing

589
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,700
primarily Apple development and he wants

590
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:43,950
to do some cybersecurity but I also

591
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:45,810
decided it was time for me to get off

592
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:47,910
the pot because as I was telling Danny

593
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:49,500
I've been in transportation for 25 years

594
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:51,360
I've been in trucking it's what I do in

595
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:53,250
the day job it pays the bills it's paid

596
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,320
very well but it's not what I love

597
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:58,350
cybersecurity is what I love breaking

598
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,879
stuff hacking it's what I love so I am

599
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:01,169
now running my own workshops during the

600
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:04,230
summer for teenagers in Louisville

601
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:07,350
I've gotten good response and I need to

602
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:09,090
work on the marketing because the kids

603
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:11,820
the kids who are signed up and and I got

604
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:16,560
them it's an interesting story I've got

605
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:17,850
plenty of time gotta talk too fast so

606
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:20,760
when it comes to marketing something

607
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:22,500
like this if you're an independent you

608
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,460
know you never know what works so of

609
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,020
course a friend of mine who does

610
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:26,460
marketing she said you know when you do

611
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,389
the follow up pre-registration he knows

612
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,670
he's asked them where they heard about

613
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:33,780
it because I did the Facebook campaign

614
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:36,330
ad stuff one of them signed up based on

615
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:39,420
what they saw on Facebook the other nine

616
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:41,280
so far which is next weekend it's all

617
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:44,910
from school it's all from talking in

618
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:46,740
school so I think there's that huge

619
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:48,600
barrier when they hear hacker they see

620
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:52,110
hacker it's whatever they've seen on CSI

621
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:54,090
cyber or mr. robot or whatever mr. robot

622
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:55,649
is the one that I will tell them if you

623
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:57,929
want to have a good indication of what

624
00:25:55,650 --> 00:26:00,600
what doing it is like now it's not in a

625
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:02,610
garage rave every time or you know

626
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,530
getting getting your ear shopped off

627
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:05,939
kind of stuff that's not I mean I guess

628
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:09,710
you could probably get yourself in that

629
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:12,000
situation I wouldn't encourage it but I

630
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:15,360
think being in front of them is showing

631
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,220
them that is accessible and the fact

632
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:20,070
that some of them already code Python he

633
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:22,680
already codes Python some of them

634
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:24,149
already do at programming so they know

635
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:26,340
the backend they know the nuts and bolts

636
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:28,230
there they're usually pretty surprised

637
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:30,570
at how accessible cybersecurity is to

638
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:32,400
them already because they're not getting

639
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:33,250
taught it at all they don't know

640
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,990
anything about it

641
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:36,850
so I think the more we talk about it the

642
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:38,140
more they understand this isn't

643
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:40,270
something that I have you know it's like

644
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:41,890
it's like a doctor or dentist if you

645
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,340
tell somebody at 15 hey you want to be a

646
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:44,980
doctor

647
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:49,510
yeah don't I have to go to school for

648
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:51,010
like 83 years yeah well if you say you

649
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:53,169
want to get into cybersecurity I don't

650
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:55,299
think the assumption is that that's

651
00:26:53,169 --> 00:26:57,250
excessively now I can I can start

652
00:26:55,299 --> 00:27:00,158
learning that stuff right now because

653
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:01,720
there is no degree barrier to it it's

654
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,610
not a professional certification that

655
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:06,789
you have to have anything to start doing

656
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:08,168
it and that's the other point is I don't

657
00:27:06,789 --> 00:27:13,240
want you going on YouTube and starting

658
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:15,789
to do it right now so that that being

659
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:17,500
said I'm hoping this is a success and

660
00:27:15,789 --> 00:27:19,270
I'm hoping I spend a whole lot of time

661
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:21,220
next year in the schools

662
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:24,639
while my current employer continues to

663
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:29,440
pay for it and they do they're very very

664
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:32,350
forgiving of that one thing before I ask

665
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:35,049
if anybody has any questions I want to

666
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:37,889
thank everybody who puts together circle

667
00:27:35,049 --> 00:27:41,830
city con this is a an awesome conference

668
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:43,510
last year when I was about one year into

669
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:45,580
learning cybersecurity they let me run

670
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:47,408
workshops in malware analysis and

671
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:51,760
volatility forensics it was an

672
00:27:47,409 --> 00:27:53,470
incredible experience so in our world

673
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,760
security operations last year I work at

674
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:59,169
this year it's one of the best ways to

675
00:27:54,760 --> 00:28:01,179
learn people or to meet people but this

676
00:27:59,169 --> 00:28:03,280
conference is really special in the

677
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:05,350
Midwest it's just it's just small enough

678
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,580
but it's just big enough to that you're

679
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:08,799
gonna meet a whole lot of people from

680
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:10,330
all over and I think Arizona's about the

681
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,280
farthest out I've met somebody so far

682
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:12,970
but I'm sure somebody from California

683
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:17,620
here somewhere

684
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:19,330
it's where I was born I do have

685
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:21,850
references in my slides and I'll post

686
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:25,830
the slide deck and this is some really

687
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:27,939
heady nerd all that stuff about

688
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:31,299
neuroplasticity is pretty much in here

689
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:33,070
so unless you have absolutely nothing

690
00:28:31,299 --> 00:28:36,070
better to do with the rest of your

691
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:41,080
evening I would not look up any one of

692
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:44,500
these papers my sucka my psychology

693
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:45,840
degree gave me a really good method for

694
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:48,870
finding real

695
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,908
search and sighting it but no one ever

696
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:54,449
no one else reads it because it's really

697
00:28:50,909 --> 00:28:58,020
really dry oh yeah

698
00:28:54,450 --> 00:29:08,669
so I forgot about Todd I had one more

699
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:10,620
for him it's a little blue so that's

700
00:29:08,669 --> 00:29:12,779
that's pretty much my presentation and

701
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:13,709
I'm sorry that I didn't take up 50

702
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:17,510
minutes I know that's one of the major

703
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:20,909
no no's along with using SunZia quotes

704
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:23,669
but but but I really appreciate you guys

705
00:29:20,909 --> 00:29:27,090
sitting in here and in in talking about

706
00:29:23,669 --> 00:29:29,640
this with me again your results are

707
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:31,320
gonna vary massively if you get in go

708
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,480
down this path I have talked to people

709
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:37,139
online who had no challenges whatsoever

710
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:40,080
I believe she was in Minnesota and I

711
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:42,179
think their their school district is

712
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,830
very very ahead of the time when it

713
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:47,220
comes to cyber engineering and stuff

714
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:49,918
like that and they have the the the

715
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:52,140
highs that was the the airforce cyber

716
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:54,270
warriors I think it is where they

717
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:56,870
actually have the the contest and they

718
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:59,668
go to Washington DC it's pretty cool

719
00:29:56,870 --> 00:30:01,379
cyberpatriots yes it's a cool program

720
00:29:59,669 --> 00:30:06,179
and that's who I was talking to from

721
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:08,190
Louisiana from nice earth thank you so

722
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:12,179
much I'm sorry I'm letting them at her

723
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:14,070
early but I really appreciate your time

724
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:18,570
this was my first talk I hope I didn't

725
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:41,668
blow it yes sir oh yes you do okay let

726
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:44,639
me have it I forgot about QA I didn't

727
00:30:41,669 --> 00:30:47,520
because I didn't want to sum my nose of

728
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:51,510
the person who it's so difficult to get

729
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:54,360
them and again that their teachers and I

730
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:57,270
know they don't make a ton of money and

731
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:59,639
they have a ton of responsibility so I

732
00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:01,590
haven't I probably will

733
00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:03,090
just just like when my one friend told

734
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:04,769
me to start asking where you heard about

735
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:08,009
this I probably will begin that

736
00:31:04,769 --> 00:31:10,259
discovery I haven't yet because all of

737
00:31:08,009 --> 00:31:12,629
this matter getting in those five public

738
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:14,549
schools was all in May prior to that

739
00:31:12,629 --> 00:31:17,399
yeah this is all just so forth that's

740
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:20,190
why the the are you kidding me a little

741
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:21,570
slide as of February when I think it was

742
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:23,190
February and I got my acceptance for

743
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:25,110
this talk at Circle City Con I was

744
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:27,659
getting nowhere and my whole talk was

745
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:28,979
I'm getting nowhere and then as soon as

746
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:31,169
my talk is accepted

747
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:45,720
hey you're somewhere Oh awesome it's

748
00:31:31,169 --> 00:31:48,240
great let me just rewrite that it

749
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:50,519
actually varies greatly and the question

750
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,769
was at what level are is it most

751
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:54,899
effective do you go to the teachers of

752
00:31:52,769 --> 00:31:56,549
the principals honestly the teach the

753
00:31:54,899 --> 00:31:58,649
principals are just going to shove

754
00:31:56,549 --> 00:31:59,850
they're gonna forward that email they're

755
00:31:58,649 --> 00:32:00,840
not going to engage in it they're not

756
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:03,299
going to try they're running a business

757
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:05,879
the teachers are the ones that I've had

758
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:06,990
the most success with and it's just got

759
00:32:05,879 --> 00:32:10,408
to be the right teacher at the right

760
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:12,740
time now the problem with teachers

761
00:32:10,409 --> 00:32:16,889
emails is they are massively firewalled

762
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:18,629
nothing gets through to them so the

763
00:32:16,889 --> 00:32:20,699
public school teachers now the private

764
00:32:18,629 --> 00:32:22,469
school teachers a little different the

765
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:25,679
public school teachers I was actually

766
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:29,700
put to them by the guy at the business

767
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:31,710
and IT lead at the district and that was

768
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,419
after I talked to Bob and had sent that

769
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:34,440
email saying hey I'm free these three

770
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:35,639
days next week which one of your

771
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:39,480
teachers have time I'll talk to him

772
00:32:35,639 --> 00:32:41,158
about careers so instead of me putting

773
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,450
the pressure on him and saying I'll do

774
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:44,549
whatever you want whenever you want you

775
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:46,289
figure it out that's what I was doing I

776
00:32:44,549 --> 00:32:48,749
was saying hey I'd love to talk about

777
00:32:46,289 --> 00:32:51,269
anything cybersecurity anytime you can

778
00:32:48,749 --> 00:32:53,070
get me into any school so he said oh so

779
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:54,539
you're giving me a task to figure out

780
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:56,428
when I can fit you in and what I want

781
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:59,549
you to talk about that's what I was

782
00:32:56,429 --> 00:33:01,230
doing and I didn't realize that until my

783
00:32:59,549 --> 00:33:03,418
friend kind of pointed that out to me

784
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:05,610
again because he lives in that world

785
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:07,950
where he's constantly selling and if he

786
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:09,269
doesn't sell he doesn't survive so he

787
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:11,190
was saying just just take that you've

788
00:33:09,269 --> 00:33:12,269
got he said your content is clearly good

789
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,700
and you clearly know what you're talking

790
00:33:12,269 --> 00:33:14,170
about

791
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:17,260
you just need to pivot a little bit and

792
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:18,970
just tell him hey I'm for you here's

793
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:20,650
what I talked about here's my slides if

794
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:22,060
you want to see him and I can do it this

795
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:24,780
hour this hour in this hour next week

796
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:27,190
but you got and sure enough within a day

797
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:31,050
he's got him and it was it was amazing

798
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:33,880
and I was thoroughly impressed by pop

799
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:35,740
because me and my nerd friends sit

800
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:38,860
around to make fun of Bob because Bob's

801
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:41,080
a sales guy and he's slick and he's fast

802
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:42,639
moving and he's shaking everybody's hand

803
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:45,639
and glad-handing and kissing babies and

804
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:47,620
all that but sure enough that animal

805
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:49,960
exists in this world too for a reason

806
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:52,780
because they're successful and and

807
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:55,230
without him I probably never would have

808
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:57,790
gone beyond those two schools so

809
00:33:55,230 --> 00:34:00,010
marketing is everywhere that's that's

810
00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:01,870
kind of the point we have to get over

811
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:03,640
ourselves and in our ideas that

812
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:05,610
everything has to be real otherwise it's

813
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:07,720
not cool enough for us in cybersecurity

814
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:12,310
and that's that's what I had to get over

815
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:15,550
to make this work that no fire I'll be

816
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:34,110
got nothing but I'm we've got nothing

817
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:37,140
but time they are for the most part I

818
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:39,610
kind of I kind of open that door myself

819
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:41,589
especially with the first talks with the

820
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:43,390
freshmen young ladies and I just said

821
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:45,429
hey you know they're young women and

822
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:47,259
it's kind of a natural thing to talk

823
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:49,750
about online safety and sharing pictures

824
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:52,330
and people being groomed online and

825
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:54,159
human trafficking and I said on you know

826
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:55,659
I don't want to get it too dark and she

827
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:59,230
said no I don't want you to get it too

828
00:34:55,659 --> 00:35:00,940
dark and she and I actually in her case

829
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:03,460
I shared with her the entire slide deck

830
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:06,340
beforehand I said here just just click

831
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:08,950
through it and it's something something

832
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:10,960
raises your spidey sense let's talk

833
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:12,580
about it I said I will gladly kick

834
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,350
anything out of there because this is

835
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:18,840
your you have to live with the aftermath

836
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:23,009
of what I say actually I did but

837
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:24,870
so no nothing was I think the teachers

838
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:26,700
haven't had this experience yet and they

839
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:28,950
probably learned as much for me because

840
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:31,350
the the people that I've repeat with

841
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:32,730
they've had some kindness on the neck

842
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:34,440
pain you know last time they kind of

843
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:35,910
lost interest in this or hey you

844
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,290
mentioned this one time could you talk

845
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:39,240
about that I get that a lot which that's

846
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:41,300
awesome because it helps me focus too

847
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:43,410
because I could talk about anything and

848
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:44,970
unfortunately if I don't get any

849
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:46,529
guidance from them I'm sitting here with

850
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:49,109
a kid and halfway through I'm like this

851
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:50,760
is sucking let's do something else and

852
00:35:49,110 --> 00:36:03,860
then I'll just get on and do some Python

853
00:35:50,760 --> 00:36:06,150
script is just straight Twitter that

854
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:07,920
that was bought that's what Bob keeps

855
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:11,130
hitting me up with that I have been a

856
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:13,320
little too weenie to broach first he

857
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:15,600
said after he and and and Danny had

858
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:17,160
asked do I have any way to follow up

859
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:19,860
with him to kind of keep that audience

860
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:21,569
going and I hadn't yet and that's the

861
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:24,000
one thing Bob and also another friend of

862
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:25,710
mine who's in marketing said you got it

863
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,880
and I said man they're they're kids

864
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:28,560
though I don't want to be asking for

865
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,170
email addresses and all that I just

866
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,700
don't want to get into that world and he

867
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:34,920
said no he said you don't do that

868
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:36,480
he said create yourself a Twitter

869
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,830
account for your defense Bureau or

870
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,720
whatever quit yourself a Twitter account

871
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:44,430
for them not you're not simple skank

872
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:46,620
they don't need that and you know let

873
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:48,180
them find you and I have had ones

874
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:49,680
follow-up because one of them I gave him

875
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:51,930
the active countermeasures book by John

876
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,430
strand because he was really into it but

877
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:54,600
he was also the type asking the

878
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:56,609
questions where that kid could be in

879
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:59,160
jail in two years because he was really

880
00:36:56,610 --> 00:37:01,050
into it and and I told his teacher was

881
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:03,060
concerned too he said hey could you make

882
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:04,890
sure you tell Troy anethe you know you

883
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:08,190
will go to jail I said yeah I did that a

884
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:09,839
lot but my idea was if I give him that

885
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:12,090
book which is very easy read it's very

886
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:14,100
small but it also really puts you in

887
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:18,480
that defender mindset while also letting

888
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:19,860
you feel like a cool attacker and he had

889
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,300
already read the book and he asked his

890
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:25,320
teacher for my email shot me an email

891
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:26,280
said it's great book I'm in so I have to

892
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:29,430
figure out how to do that without

893
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:31,619
feeling kind of greasy about asking kids

894
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:38,819
for email addresses I really

895
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:40,650
I haven't figured it out yet no matter

896
00:37:38,819 --> 00:37:41,849
of fact I'm heading up the OWASP chapter

897
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:44,880
that's starting in this summer

898
00:37:41,849 --> 00:37:46,200
I just got roped into that and was gonna

899
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,460
just join the chapter and then the guy

900
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,439
who was running it dropped out and said

901
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:53,430
hey you would like doing this yeah I

902
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:56,279
would so and we have Civic data Alliance

903
00:37:53,430 --> 00:38:00,269
we have a 2600 group they're not geared

904
00:37:56,279 --> 00:38:02,549
towards kids so much but I think I've

905
00:38:00,269 --> 00:38:04,379
got a lot of traction in what I did this

906
00:38:02,549 --> 00:38:05,400
year going into next year I think I'm

907
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:07,859
not going to be running out of

908
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:10,140
opportunities I did reach back out to

909
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:12,479
the public school all four of the

910
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:14,190
teachers whose classes I talked in and

911
00:38:12,479 --> 00:38:15,569
the guy from the district I reached

912
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:17,099
backed out to him last week and they all

913
00:38:15,569 --> 00:38:19,288
responded said yeah it was awesome can't

914
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:20,969
wait to see you next year so I told him

915
00:38:19,289 --> 00:38:21,719
I said anytime your class brings up

916
00:38:20,969 --> 00:38:24,089
something you want to talk about

917
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:25,410
something give me a weeks notice

918
00:38:24,089 --> 00:38:29,029
I'll be in there and I'll have all the

919
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:29,029
research and I'll we'll go for it

920
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:38,009
honestly it's mostly about what can I

921
00:38:36,269 --> 00:38:40,558
get away with what can I get caught

922
00:38:38,009 --> 00:38:44,249
doing how can I not get caught doing it

923
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:48,479
and what if someone hacks my facebook

924
00:38:44,249 --> 00:38:49,558
Instagram Pinterest aim lines but some

925
00:38:48,479 --> 00:38:51,509
of them have some really cool ones

926
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:54,599
because one of the teachers had actually

927
00:38:51,509 --> 00:38:56,309
shown them the Internet's own boy one of

928
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:58,799
the schools had had a debate in the

929
00:38:56,309 --> 00:39:01,950
class about privacy so they asked me

930
00:38:58,799 --> 00:39:04,440
about cellphone backdoors versus Public

931
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:08,460
Safety which was incredible conversation

932
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:10,019
it was awesome it was that was cool and

933
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:13,380
it allowed us to just go down that path

934
00:39:10,019 --> 00:39:15,029
and talk about that stuff and that's why

935
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:17,309
that's why I found it to be very

936
00:39:15,029 --> 00:39:19,650
effective to show him the career stuff

937
00:39:17,309 --> 00:39:21,049
that satisfies the teachers requirement

938
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:23,279
why the teacher let me in the room

939
00:39:21,049 --> 00:39:25,650
there's the career slides I'll share

940
00:39:23,279 --> 00:39:27,900
with anybody and then what do you want

941
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:29,400
to know let's talk about it and if I

942
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,989
don't know I'll go find out and I'll

943
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,219
share it with you which is the only one

944
00:39:30,989 --> 00:39:34,619
I didn't know and I didn't really want

945
00:39:32,219 --> 00:39:36,450
to wrack my brain for was somebody asked

946
00:39:34,619 --> 00:39:38,110
something very esoteric about public key

947
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:43,390
infrastructure

948
00:39:38,110 --> 00:40:31,540
now let's bring it back to fun stuff yes

949
00:39:43,390 --> 00:40:34,750
sir yes yes yes I assume that time his

950
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:36,940
school a Catholic elementary school

951
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:38,290
didn't have a coding Club they had

952
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:40,150
computer class I think was one day a

953
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:42,640
week and they still have it one day a

954
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:43,930
week and we started because he was very

955
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,810
interested in we started a coding Club

956
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:48,750
with scratch which in third grade okay

957
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:52,330
great

958
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:54,370
they never really graduated past that so

959
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:56,560
people kids like him who were really

960
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:59,560
into programming and coding just

961
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:01,150
continued on on their own he got the no

962
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:04,840
starch book on internet of Python and

963
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:06,190
took off on his own and I honestly it

964
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:08,680
feels like that's kind of how those

965
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:10,300
elementary school situations go is that

966
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,950
you have to give them the front line

967
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:15,310
exposure and it has to be something like

968
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:16,870
scratch where it's accessible let the

969
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:19,660
ones who actually are interested in it

970
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:21,970
and hook on to it fly with it and the

971
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:25,140
ones who aren't can play football or

972
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:28,629
whatever whatever speaks to them

973
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:30,220
personally I in a situation where we had

974
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:32,380
to have programming every day it was

975
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:34,569
part of our curriculum and that's why I

976
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:36,670
