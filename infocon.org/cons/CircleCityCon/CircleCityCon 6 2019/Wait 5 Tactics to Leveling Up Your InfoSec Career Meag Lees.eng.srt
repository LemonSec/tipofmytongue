1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,649
hi thank you so very very much for

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:10,860
coming to my first InfoSec talk the

3
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:15,860
title is don't wait level up five

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,860
tactics to building your InfoSec career

5
00:00:18,529 --> 00:00:24,630
so I wanted this to have sort of a

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,970
walkthrough tutorial game feel as we

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:30,840
have five specific tactics that we'll go

8
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:32,640
into the first one is hunker down find a

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,950
place to really build your core skill

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,250
sets this has actually been one of the

11
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:40,170
hardest ones for me personally second

12
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,700
one is strength training learning how to

13
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,070
cycle through your strengths and

14
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:47,670
weaknesses when you're learning in order

15
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:50,100
to avoid getting discouraged third one

16
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,140
is motivation this section deals with

17
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,030
both the inspiration and the discipline

18
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,930
that's needed to really build your

19
00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:00,300
skills over time 4 is mentors and

20
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,370
coaches with this one will go into

21
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:07,530
resources for networking and seeking

22
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:12,990
guidance and failure it's gonna happen

23
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:13,940
we're going to talk about it with little

24
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,660
help

25
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:22,370
old friends from Katamari Damacy our

26
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:24,080
walkthrough is ready to roll before we

27
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:26,330
move on entirely I want to talk about

28
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,170
what makes InfoSec a career worth

29
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:29,300
pursuing

30
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:31,760
whether it's change from your current

31
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,460
career or relaunching after taking a

32
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,650
professional break I reached out on

33
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:38,780
Twitter and in slack and discord

34
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:41,540
channels and two types of responses

35
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:43,970
really kept cropping up people who want

36
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:48,520
to change the world and people who want

37
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:50,960
steady work neither one of those is bad

38
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,460
with their permission I have just a

39
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,919
couple of people's quotes that really

40
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:57,770
stood out to me the first one was

41
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,450
Tanisha who said it I think really well

42
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:01,910
she said there's a lot of new tech

43
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:04,100
coming out that isn't taking privacy or

44
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:08,810
safety into consideration I want to get

45
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:11,390
involved she is absolutely right people

46
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:14,390
have a tendency to be so preoccupied

47
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:17,529
with whether or not they could they

48
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:19,700
didn't stop to think their face would

49
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:22,040
but then on the other hand we have Matt

50
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:25,310
who observed there's more than enough

51
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:28,880
work for anyone what other industry can

52
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:30,709
say that and he is also not wrong it

53
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,950
doesn't matter which roles you fit into

54
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:36,350
or where you look from Forbes to Reddit

55
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:37,940
everybody seems to recognize the fact

56
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:40,459
that we're one of the few industries

57
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:43,790
that doesn't have any problem staying in

58
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:47,540
work we have problems finding people who

59
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:50,030
are interested but whether your goals

60
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:52,519
are to make change immediately or build

61
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:56,390
something more long-term there are roles

62
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:58,519
that anybody can apply themselves to as

63
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:04,679
long as they're putting willing to put

64
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:08,370
in the work but okay so

65
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:10,459
that's what's being offered to us what

66
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:12,359
do we offer this industry in return

67
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:14,790
especially for non-traditional

68
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:18,329
candidates it's important to remember

69
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:21,989
that there is plenty consider our unique

70
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:27,180
backgrounds maturity for one is always

71
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:29,670
an asset as David memy quipped but quite

72
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:32,370
literally being familiar with older tech

73
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:37,260
can be valuable in terms of research and

74
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:39,150
tactical analysis besides with the

75
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:42,750
variety of roles that can fall under the

76
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:45,389
umbrella of information security it's

77
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:48,209
virtually impossible for one person to

78
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:50,430
know every platform or tool available

79
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:52,379
likewise with having a familiarity with

80
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,000
all business types it's just not

81
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:55,888
possible

82
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,829
corporate roles and backgrounds bring a

83
00:03:55,889 --> 00:04:00,510
familiarity with enterprise level

84
00:03:57,829 --> 00:04:03,120
organizational structure politics and

85
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:05,569
nuance but on the other hand independent

86
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,569
profession

87
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:18,180
I'll bring a drive and a creativity

88
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:24,719
can't hide in a crowd startup energy is

89
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:27,270
a real thing but where to begin how to

90
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,010
start as the king would say once you've

91
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:31,229
been bitten by the bug it can be a

92
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:35,370
daunting task to figure out how to get

93
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:37,740
your foot in the door humbly I now

94
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:43,620
present the following five tactics to

95
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:46,650
level up your InfoSec career first one

96
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:48,750
like we talked about hunker down getting

97
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:51,239
on-the-job experience wherever you are

98
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:53,700
with teams that are even tangentially

99
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:57,140
related to your desired career move our

100
00:04:53,700 --> 00:05:01,409
valuable this is a process that spans

101
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:03,900
spanned years for me personally and it I

102
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:05,760
think it should it allows you to

103
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:09,870
continue to build up your skill sets in

104
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:12,690
both abroad and a deep dive sense big

105
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:14,850
companies versus small companies you get

106
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:18,230
exposed to different Hardware different

107
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:22,560
experiences with vendors licensing

108
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:25,650
clients the thing to remember is that

109
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,000
none of these experiences is wasted even

110
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:31,200
when you're performing tasks that you

111
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:34,440
swear you will never use again hi I was

112
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:38,460
a clear well admin nobody knows what

113
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:42,120
that is but I've used it twice this year

114
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:44,039
on assessments so you seriously never

115
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,950
know what's going to come in handy

116
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:50,880
I've used skills that I've learned as a

117
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:55,979
cable company tech a network admin for a

118
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:58,409
corporate company a fortune teller I've

119
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:02,850
used all of those skill sets in my

120
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:05,190
current job nothing is wasted shadowing

121
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:08,640
is another solid way of getting a look

122
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:11,190
on the job at other roles you might be

123
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:13,770
interested in and also getting a chance

124
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:17,580
to talk to the folks who are living the

125
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:20,909
day-to-day realities of it ask questions

126
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:23,640
take notes but the most important thing

127
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:26,310
is to sit back and kind of absorb the

128
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:28,349
work that's going on around you the tone

129
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:29,080
of the team how they work with other

130
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:31,990
teams

131
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:35,740
and what your personal connection to the

132
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:38,080
work might be you may have a lot of

133
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:40,270
experiences and some of them may not pan

134
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:46,948
out the way that you expect initially

135
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:50,740
it's okay it's part of the journey tip 2

136
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:53,319
strength training build on your current

137
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:56,620
strengths when you're seeking out new

138
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:58,659
challenges and new skills to learn be

139
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,940
aware that there can be kind of a

140
00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:02,830
learning curve jumping into a new

141
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:05,289
discipline or a project with both feet

142
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:09,280
can wind up being frustrating

143
00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:12,219
or worse discouraging I work towards

144
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,710
balancing between projects cycling

145
00:07:12,219 --> 00:07:18,250
through familiar skillsets and new skill

146
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:20,138
sets that's which between projects that

147
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:23,020
might be heavier on the creative side

148
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:25,000
once and I come to a stopping point and

149
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:27,008
then I move on to something that I might

150
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,150
be less familiar with for me that

151
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:33,430
usually means working on an exploit

152
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:36,729
learning to code better something that I

153
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:38,169
find more challenging cycling back and

154
00:07:36,729 --> 00:07:41,258
forth between my strengths and my

155
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:43,960
weaknesses in this way helps even though

156
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:45,490
I might get frustrated on one project it

157
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,008
might not work out exactly the way I

158
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:50,460
thought I can always think back and know

159
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:54,460
that I did something that I was proud of

160
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:58,620
recently and it can help work through

161
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:58,620
those frustrating challenging moments

162
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:04,900
working through that takes motivation

163
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:07,419
there's a couple of things we're going

164
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:10,359
to talk about with motivation one our

165
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:12,639
day is the very first tip that I will

166
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,520
give you this is a concept that's

167
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:18,039
strongly endorsed by movements such as

168
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,889
hundred days of code and it's especially

169
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:23,800
suited to learning new technical skill

170
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:25,840
sets it it can be easy to lose

171
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,990
motivation when things get difficult

172
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,729
when things get dull it's easy to be

173
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:33,669
motivated when things are interesting

174
00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:36,789
and stimulating you might do nine hours

175
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:38,620
of work on a project one day but the

176
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:40,360
next day you really burn out on it and

177
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:42,150
you don't want to deal with it anymore

178
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,220
if you make

179
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:48,090
self have the discipline for one hour a

180
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:50,790
day it makes you focus you'd learn to

181
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:56,730
use your time more efficiently I have

182
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:58,079
one hour to accomplish my goal today the

183
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:00,360
other thing that you're doing is

184
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:04,140
building good habits you're building

185
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:07,310
discipline discipline is what you fall

186
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:10,860
back on when inspiration fails you

187
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:12,989
inspiration will always fail you you

188
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,670
have to build those good habits and you

189
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:17,610
have to make a commitment either to your

190
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:20,969
team or to yourself especially to

191
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:23,910
yourself to follow through commitment is

192
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:26,760
the key to your discipline you have to

193
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:29,610
make up your mind to check in do the

194
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:32,850
hour and follow through as often as you

195
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:34,920
can make yourself and it's not going to

196
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:37,530
happen every day there's going to be off

197
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:39,510
days if you have an off day don't kill

198
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:42,240
yourself over it if you have to off days

199
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:44,700
all right so fine discipline the in

200
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,240
commitment also mean getting back on the

201
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,270
horse

202
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:50,970
when you're ready and starting over or

203
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:52,880
picking up where you left off but you

204
00:09:50,970 --> 00:10:01,200
make that commitment to yourself and

205
00:09:52,880 --> 00:10:03,450
then you follow through number four part

206
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:07,290
of following through is mentors and

207
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:11,600
coaches I encourage you to seek diverse

208
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:14,370
mentors seek a lot of different people

209
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:17,490
get their opinions you might not agree

210
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:19,470
with all of them that's good too one

211
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:22,590
single mentor is rarely going to be your

212
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:27,240
sole guide as your career progresses you

213
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:29,550
shouldn't have one single mentor social

214
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:34,380
media is especially valuable for this

215
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:36,750
but be aware for your own tolerance for

216
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:46,240
shenanigans social media can also become

217
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:51,610
toxic if you allow it no Twitter

218
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:53,529
I also encourage you to attend talks at

219
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:55,660
conferences and where appropriate

220
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:56,559
approach speakers with questions

221
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:59,709
afterwards

222
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:02,529
this is actually how I met my friend and

223
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:04,449
boss and how I decided that penetration

224
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:06,790
testing was a career path that I was

225
00:11:04,449 --> 00:11:10,300
interested in it took me three years

226
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:12,610
from my first conversation after a talk

227
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:14,649
he gave before I was ready to make that

228
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:17,339
jump in my career but it was three years

229
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:20,350
of learning on the job experience

230
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:23,589
shadowing with other people and really

231
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:29,110
getting a feel for what might be my

232
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:32,230
connection to the industry various

233
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:35,170
channels on slack and discord all exist

234
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:38,290
for niche groups and with the intent of

235
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:40,689
growing different skill sets and getting

236
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:43,809
to learn in a group environment even if

237
00:11:40,689 --> 00:11:46,149
you're not geographically physically

238
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:49,300
located near a group of people that you

239
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:52,749
can meet up with all the time I do have

240
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:54,758
a couple of links there is especially

241
00:11:52,749 --> 00:12:00,429
for the women in the room there is a

242
00:11:54,759 --> 00:12:03,999
ladies CTF circle on slack and there

243
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:06,249
have been I think there's a discord

244
00:12:03,999 --> 00:12:08,889
server out there as well I will mention

245
00:12:06,249 --> 00:12:11,559
those are by invitation so the links at

246
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:14,639
the end I encourage you to reach out to

247
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:18,309
those moderators of those groups

248
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:23,589
introduce yourself find out if you want

249
00:12:18,309 --> 00:12:26,350
to get involved and that I've probably

250
00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:32,230
talked way too fast I'm sorry that

251
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:33,920
brings us to the last failure don't fear

252
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:37,370
failure

253
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:39,260
you're gonna fail this can be seriously

254
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:42,110
one of the biggest hurdles it is one of

255
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:43,970
the most frustrating it happens to

256
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:45,860
everybody you have to expect a certain

257
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:49,459
amount of failure when you're trying to

258
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:51,079
figure out where you fit every

259
00:12:49,459 --> 00:12:53,839
experience is valuable like I keep

260
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:57,560
ranting and making mistakes is

261
00:12:53,839 --> 00:13:01,610
everyone's common denominator in a past

262
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:04,010
life I was a rowing coach told you I use

263
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:07,070
a lot of different skill sets

264
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:08,779
boats rivers that sort of thing and we

265
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:11,060
had a sing that we used to remind all of

266
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:13,519
our novice rowers throughout the season

267
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:15,888
and usually it was necessary to remind

268
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,139
them more than once that there were two

269
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:20,899
types of rowers those who have fallen

270
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:24,709
into the water and those who have yet to

271
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:26,300
fall into the water it works the same

272
00:13:24,709 --> 00:13:29,180
way in tack it doesn't matter whether

273
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:32,300
you're Red Team Blue Team corporate

274
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:33,579
Enterprise fiercely independent mistakes

275
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:40,339
will be made

276
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:42,709
production impacting mistakes it's what

277
00:13:40,339 --> 00:13:45,130
you choose to do when those mistakes

278
00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:49,518
happen that turn them into opportunities

279
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:51,829
and lessons how we choose to respond

280
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:56,329
when we discover that we've genuinely

281
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:59,959
made an error or are the cause the root

282
00:13:56,329 --> 00:14:02,870
cause of an incident this informs our

283
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:07,430
teammates or bosses our clients who we

284
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:12,320
really are under pressure our authentic

285
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:14,390
selves you might say we can't control

286
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,699
everything we can't control everything

287
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:19,069
that happens to us or our projects no

288
00:14:16,699 --> 00:14:20,930
matter how much we might try but we have

289
00:14:19,069 --> 00:14:23,360
the power to see things as challenges

290
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:30,109
and to decide to grow from them

291
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:31,880
regardless of the outcome I have a miss

292
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:35,149
placed slide this is supposed to come

293
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:38,600
after the QA and I've totally talked too

294
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:42,529
fast I think yes 16 minutes out of a

295
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:47,690
50-minute slot ah like I said it's my

296
00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:49,700
first one so I'm still alive no tomatoes

297
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:52,850
thank you

298
00:14:49,700 --> 00:15:00,709
I guess from here y'all got 45 minutes

299
00:14:52,850 --> 00:15:05,240
for Q&A what's up yes let me put the

300
00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:07,939
useful links back up there and I will

301
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:10,160
put a slide deck somewhere available for

302
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:34,430
you guys also so if you want the the

303
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:36,560
data bits comes from that it can be so

304
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:39,319
the question is when you're trying to

305
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,839
advance in that career especially if you

306
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:44,329
like your organization or your company

307
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:47,390
and you don't really want to leave how

308
00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:49,310
do you negotiate or work yourself into a

309
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:56,089
better position a position that you like

310
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:58,790
better I have been there the tactic that

311
00:15:56,089 --> 00:16:02,149
I took initially was the shadowing that

312
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:04,160
I discussed earlier I went to my direct

313
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:07,579
manager I let them know that I was

314
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:10,100
interested in doing more and I got the

315
00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:12,229
opportunity to shadow with the security

316
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:15,560
team I was on vulnerability and patching

317
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:17,390
and was just sort of working my way kind

318
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:21,949
of through the ranks there and it gave

319
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:24,470
me an opportunity to not only see sort

320
00:16:21,949 --> 00:16:30,349
of what corporate enterprise InfoSec

321
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:32,390
looked like but also the team as a whole

322
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:34,940
and how they interacted with their

323
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:36,220
bosses was informational at other

324
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:39,890
companies later

325
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:42,529
so shadowing is one good tactic the

326
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:43,720
negotiation part of it I would say when

327
00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:47,680
you're doing annual

328
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:50,649
views bring up goals that you have

329
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:54,189
personally talk to your manager try to

330
00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:56,949
make a relationship with them and get

331
00:16:54,189 --> 00:16:59,529
them to be pulling for you because if

332
00:16:56,949 --> 00:17:01,750
you can work together on it then you

333
00:16:59,529 --> 00:17:05,409
start to see a little more progress a

334
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:08,799
little faster but ya make professional

335
00:17:05,409 --> 00:17:12,520
goals a part of your either annual

336
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:14,530
review quarterly review I would say even

337
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,780
on a monthly basis if you wanted to

338
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:19,209
start having meetings as long as you're

339
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:22,000
getting it in front of the people that

340
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:25,780
you report to they know that it's a

341
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,119
passion and at some point it does come

342
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:32,200
to a head and you do have to make a

343
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:34,989
decision previously I was a network

344
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:37,270
administrator and I was pretty happy

345
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:41,140
doing what I did I liked my company they

346
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:44,889
stood by me pretty well but it wasn't

347
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:47,200
exactly my passion and I knew that I

348
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:48,870
wanted to do more and I had that

349
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,730
relationship with my manager at the time

350
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:53,770
where he understood that I was even

351
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:57,309
doing stuff on the side I was working on

352
00:17:53,770 --> 00:18:00,039
CTFs I was building up my skill sets and

353
00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:04,629
as long as it didn't interrupt my

354
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:06,280
day-to-day tasks he was cool with it but

355
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:07,900
eventually it didn't come up where I had

356
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:10,418
the opportunity to make that jump and

357
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:13,360
you have to make the decision for

358
00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:16,210
yourself whether it's your passion or

359
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:19,658
your company that guides you and if you

360
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:22,840
really are passionate and your company

361
00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:26,500
isn't willing to make that a reality for

362
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:30,789
you I would always advocate for going

363
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:34,570
towards your passion companies will come

364
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:38,620
and go usually we stay because of good

365
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:41,168
managers good teams it's rarely small

366
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:44,799
amount of the time it's actually the

367
00:18:41,169 --> 00:18:47,230
company that you stay for and if that's

368
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:50,200
the case usually they're willing to work

369
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:52,830
with you so so

370
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:55,930
you do have to make the jump I did and

371
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:58,720
personally I'm far far better off and

372
00:18:55,930 --> 00:19:02,220
happier the way that I am so I always

373
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,220
advocate to go towards your passion

374
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:28,960
there was definitely a moment of

375
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:31,540
crossroads for me there were a couple of

376
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,530
them specifically so the first one

377
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:38,889
happened I was in Columbus Ohio at the

378
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:42,629
Issa conference and this gentleman over

379
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:46,230
here Phil Grimes the Grape Ape

380
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:50,620
was doing a talk on physical security I

381
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:54,130
was not there to see him I was there to

382
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:55,929
see Frank Abigail who I'm sure a lot of

383
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:58,000
you are familiar with that name he's the

384
00:19:55,930 --> 00:20:01,210
guy who inspired catch me if you can a

385
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:07,720
movie the book all of it I was there to

386
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:09,520
see Frank Avondale speak and it was it

387
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,290
was almost completely irrelevant to

388
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:17,379
current tech he was talking about check

389
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:19,389
washing I did get his favorite pen that

390
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:22,570
cannot be check washed out of the whole

391
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:24,760
talk and then I stuck around afterwards

392
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:26,260
because he had a throng of people around

393
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,430
him and I kind of wanted to go shake his

394
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:30,940
hand but I didn't want to be one of

395
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:32,710
those people so I stuck around and this

396
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:36,190
guy got up on stage and started talking

397
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:39,310
about physical security and if you have

398
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:42,250
ever had the opportunity to watch a talk

399
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:43,780
about a physical pen test or have had

400
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:48,280
the opportunity to perform a physical

401
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:51,129
pen test it's so much fun it's so much

402
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:53,530
fun it is breaking into places it's

403
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:56,290
dressing up it's cops and robbers it's

404
00:20:53,530 --> 00:21:01,389
playing spies and it was everything that

405
00:20:56,290 --> 00:21:04,300
appealed to the child in me and it was

406
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:08,590
doing it without getting busted

407
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:11,430
so after the talk I walked up to him

408
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:13,929
shook his hand and said that was crazy

409
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:17,500
because the one thing that stuck out for

410
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:19,630
me was your comment about when you work

411
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,820
on blue team and like I said I was a

412
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:23,200
network admin at the time when you work

413
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:25,840
on the blue team you've got to be right

414
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:28,540
a hundred percent of the time when you

415
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:32,409
work on the red team usually you only

416
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:34,720
have to be right once I was really tired

417
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:36,940
of being on the blue team it was a it

418
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,400
was a good company they stick by me I

419
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,910
was getting bored with what I was

420
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,380
learning

421
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:44,350
they weren't pushing me towards my

422
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:47,050
passion and for the next three years

423
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:48,990
because we talked about it and he said

424
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:51,310
all right I'm going to build out a team

425
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:53,770
talk to me when you're ready to do this

426
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:57,840
jump and so for the next three years I

427
00:21:53,770 --> 00:22:01,540
worked Network admin system admin

428
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:04,510
security admin I just kind of bounced

429
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:06,610
around within the same company doing

430
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:09,129
different jobs but always in the back of

431
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:13,060
my mind was this thought of going to

432
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:16,120
play spy and it would be so much fun and

433
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:18,280
in the meantime I started doing CTFs and

434
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:23,260
learning about web application security

435
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:26,910
and the variances of playing spy online

436
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:31,000
and that Venn diagram of spy and hacker

437
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:33,910
kinda has a middle ground there about

438
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,350
three years later I had been doing all

439
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:42,370
of this work and I got a phone call a

440
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:45,850
question I'm building out a team would

441
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:47,949
you like to join my company had not

442
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:50,080
pushed me towards my passion they had

443
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:54,400
kept me where I was because they needed

444
00:22:50,080 --> 00:23:00,330
me I decided to go towards the passion

445
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:00,330
and so for the last 18 months

446
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:08,990
I came in pretty green and I have been a

447
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:08,990
security consultant penetration tester I

448
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:15,990
didn't know a single thing I feel like

449
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:18,090
when I got into it in spite of all of

450
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:19,650
the work that I had done up until that

451
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:22,919
point I felt like I was starting from

452
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:25,710
zero and it was great I've been given

453
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:28,170
the opportunity to learn operating

454
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:31,140
systems I hadn't muck about with before

455
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:33,750
it gave me the opportunity to dig in on

456
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:36,390
some really nasty exploits that I never

457
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:42,030
had a chance to set off and watch in

458
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:45,920
real life before and it also introduced

459
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:45,920
me to the hell that is writing reports

460
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:52,830
which hasn't deterred me before that's a

461
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:56,100
tough one but yeah it's that was my aha

462
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:59,689
moment was a combination of figuring out

463
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:02,100
what spoke to the child in me and then

464
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:04,350
getting the opportunity to make that

465
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:06,600
jump I had struggled for three years

466
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:09,659
trying to force it to happen and it

467
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:26,010
hadn't so when it was handed to me all I

468
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:28,710
could do was taken I got asked I had

469
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:32,040
actually submitted this talk before and

470
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:35,520
I didn't get accepted initially but they

471
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:39,170
needed another person to fill in so I

472
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,170
panicked and said yes

473
00:24:43,890 --> 00:25:05,970
maybe else red flags when you're at a

474
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:09,340
company or interviewing at a company hmm

475
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:14,560
the biggest red flag that I've ever seen

476
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:17,050
is when you walk into a room and the

477
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:21,330
person that has invited you to the

478
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:21,330
interview doesn't get your name right

479
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:28,330
that's it's a big one for me my name is

480
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:29,080
spelled funny it's not that funny my

481
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:32,020
name is Megan

482
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:34,320
but it's MEA GHA and then it's 18 points

483
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:34,320
at Scrabble

484
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:41,590
if you've invited me to an interview and

485
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:45,340
you shake my hand and say Megan and you

486
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:50,050
don't pause and say or and wait at least

487
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:51,879
politely for me to correct you it's a

488
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:53,409
major sign of disrespect that's it

489
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:57,520
that's one of the biggest red flags

490
00:25:53,410 --> 00:26:02,140
right off the bat for me a red flag when

491
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:06,970
you're at your company currently if you

492
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:10,770
feel like your requests to grow are

493
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:13,690
being ignored or being overlooked or

494
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:16,690
that you're intentionally being kept in

495
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:18,190
a position because you're useful because

496
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:21,850
they don't have anybody else who's

497
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:24,400
willing to take that job on that's a big

498
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:26,350
red flag for me that is a company that's

499
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,640
not going to advance you that's a

500
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:28,929
company that's not interested in your

501
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:32,680
passion they're interested in what

502
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:34,300
you're good at right now even if you're

503
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:37,170
happy with that it may not be what

504
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:37,169
you're happy with forever

505
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:48,889
big red flags just if there's a blatant

506
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:52,750
disrespect people that that aren't

507
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:55,790
willing to work together as a team

508
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:57,860
people who want to just show about be

509
00:26:55,790 --> 00:27:00,950
rock stars things like that those are

510
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:01,580
kind of red flags for me I'm in it for

511
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:05,210
the team

512
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:10,669
I'm as Andrew hay is fond of saying I'm

513
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:15,680
in it for the users so for me people who

514
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:18,980
just want to be in it for the glory that

515
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:20,570
probably sets off a red flag for me if

516
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:22,370
you want to go be a rock star go be a

517
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:25,010
rock star that's that's cool

518
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:28,429
but if you're there to build a team to

519
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:32,950
work I think probably that that

520
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:32,950
motivation should show through

521
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,910
conferences the question is how do you

522
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:07,370
figure out which role that you have a

523
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:11,600
passion for and it's a lot of trial and

524
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:14,629
error it's a lot of going and sometimes

525
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:17,929
shadowing again going to conferences is

526
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:20,600
an excellent way of sitting in talks and

527
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:23,920
finding other people in the room who

528
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:26,389
have similar questions for me it was

529
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:30,110
CTFs because it gave me an opportunity

530
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:36,080
to try on different tactics different

531
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:38,500
exploits really just getting and getting

532
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,699
the time to talk to people who are in

533
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:43,420
the roles that you think that you're

534
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,420
interested in

535
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:50,350
but I think there's also a lot of

536
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:54,340
potential jumping around not jumping

537
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:59,110
around but moving from one job style or

538
00:28:54,340 --> 00:29:02,340
role to another and and having that

539
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:02,340
opportunity taking those opportunities

540
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:12,610
thank you and to that point mentorship

541
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:15,100
and guidance has been really crucial for

542
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:19,840
me in finding out what I like what I'm

543
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:24,070
into social media again like I said can

544
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:25,779
be very useful for that different slack

545
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:27,460
channels discordant channels where you

546
00:30:25,779 --> 00:30:30,159
can get an opportunity to talk to people

547
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:33,820
a lot of them are really nice and even

548
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:42,130
have mentorship channels within those

549
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:47,639
groups romance hey we made it all the

550
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:47,640
way after 30 minutes thanks guys go team

551
00:30:48,390 --> 00:31:06,280
all right you do know that's absolutely

552
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:09,220
true you need probably three or four

553
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:12,700
years of experience just kind of bopping

554
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:15,850
around trying on different things trying

555
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:19,660
and failing before you're even going to

556
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:23,199
start at zero and that can it sounds

557
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:25,270
maybe a little defeatist but looking at

558
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,630
it as an opportunity you get a lot of

559
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:30,460
hills and valleys within a career and

560
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:32,560
sometimes you find yourself going on the

561
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:34,450
upswing and you may plateau for a little

562
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:36,550
while find that you're in a spot that

563
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:39,730
you like and that you're learning and

564
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:41,830
then you get that opportunity and I

565
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:45,670
encourage everybody to take that

566
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:49,870
opportunity I can't emphasize this

567
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:53,980
enough companies will come and go you

568
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:56,459
have to go for the job that you like you

569
00:31:53,980 --> 00:32:04,300
have to go for the tasks that you like

570
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:25,190
projects I'm not sure I answered your

571
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:29,779
question there I will tell

572
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:31,999
I did it yep IT ITV was how helpdesk was

573
00:32:29,779 --> 00:32:33,440
how I got into it I used to be a

574
00:32:31,999 --> 00:32:38,210
medievalist that was going to be a

575
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:42,849
librarian at one point I decided I liked

576
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:42,849
eating so I needed a different job and

577
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:50,720
coincidentally I was pretty good at IT

578
00:32:46,849 --> 00:32:53,389
in high school and college so I got in

579
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:56,019
with teleperformance call tech if

580
00:32:53,389 --> 00:32:59,649
anybody's familiar it's an outsourced

581
00:32:56,019 --> 00:33:04,009
third-party helpdesk company it's hell

582
00:32:59,649 --> 00:33:05,719
but it gave me some really good

583
00:33:04,009 --> 00:33:08,239
experience it gave me good experience

584
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:10,340
working with users explaining things

585
00:33:08,239 --> 00:33:14,479
that once you have had the experience of

586
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:18,199
explaining where the any key is to 15

587
00:33:14,479 --> 00:33:20,659
people in an eight-hour period you can

588
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:24,279
explain anything to anyone ever and

589
00:33:20,659 --> 00:33:27,379
that's really useful in other skill sets

590
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:29,720
but yeah if you're if you're looking for

591
00:33:27,379 --> 00:33:31,428
that bottom bottom level I just want to

592
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:33,529
get my foot in the door the way I did it

593
00:33:31,429 --> 00:33:37,399
was with help desks and IT I actually

594
00:33:33,529 --> 00:33:40,429
managed to work out of that help desk

595
00:33:37,399 --> 00:33:44,299
into management and then went right back

596
00:33:40,429 --> 00:33:44,899
down onto a password reset team that's

597
00:33:44,299 --> 00:33:47,330
all I did

598
00:33:44,899 --> 00:33:56,539
eight hours no more finding me any key

599
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:58,189
just password resets I spent about spent

600
00:33:56,539 --> 00:34:00,139
about nine months at the helpdesk and

601
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:02,409
then I quit and then I came back a month

602
00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:05,658
later because I couldn't get another job

603
00:34:02,409 --> 00:34:10,789
and so I spend another six months there

604
00:34:05,659 --> 00:34:13,010
and then I got the password reset job in

605
00:34:10,789 --> 00:34:16,010
my interview I'm sitting there with them

606
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:19,789
and the manager says you're an

607
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:23,990
Operations Manager I said yeah it's ok

608
00:34:19,789 --> 00:34:26,179
he said this is a password reset help

609
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:28,819
desk job are you sure that you want to

610
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:30,139
do this it will tell you something about

611
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:33,909
the environment that I was in that I

612
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:36,730
said yes get me out of here

613
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:38,529
so a lot of hills and valleys but from

614
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:41,020
password resets I worked up to a

615
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:43,570
business applications team that gave me

616
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:45,040
an enormous amount of exposure to all

617
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:48,430
kinds of health care business

618
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:50,560
applications things that that otherwise

619
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:55,270
I might never have been able to dig my

620
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:58,120
my fingers into I became this me on

621
00:34:55,270 --> 00:35:01,570
certain topics that were really obscure

622
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:03,310
or some of the more well-known from

623
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:07,020
there that got me a job with

624
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:11,259
vulnerability and compliance patching

625
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:12,640
that sort of awakened in me the fact

626
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:16,600
that I didn't want to stay on a passing

627
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:21,220
team forever but ten gently' I got to

628
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:27,190
shadow with an InfoSec team that really

629
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:30,129
started I had a manager from that

630
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:32,350
InfoSec team who told me I'll let you

631
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:34,270
shadow my guys as long as you promise me

632
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:36,759
you're not going to go into pen testing

633
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:46,210
that sexy and everybody wants to go

634
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:48,760
into it but a lot of little ups and

635
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:52,090
downs where I just took the opportunity

636
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:54,550
to work with other teams or be sometimes

637
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:57,670
the only person who had to wear all that

638
00:35:54,550 --> 00:36:00,240
and that also wraps up your skill sets

639
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:00,240
pretty quickly

640
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,109
personally when presented with a brash

641
00:36:38,619 --> 00:36:47,740
environment I tend to make the situation

642
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:50,140
worse or better depending on your

643
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:55,330
perception I'm not popular with HR

644
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:58,029
departments so for folks for whom that

645
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:59,759
is not their cup of tea I would say just

646
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:02,320
be really honest with yourself a

647
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:05,800
interviews in person and on the phone

648
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:07,750
are team interviews specifically are

649
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:11,590
really important for getting a feel for

650
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:15,430
how people interact with each other and

651
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:18,670
if you have the opportunity to find that

652
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:21,520
team and interact with them outside of a

653
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:23,710
strict interview experience like at a

654
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,990
conference or something like that

655
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:27,700
that can be also be really valuable you

656
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:29,500
get the opportunity to see what their

657
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:31,060
what they're like in their off hours and

658
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:33,970
see if these are people that you would

659
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:36,340
be friends with you don't have to be

660
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:36,819
friends obviously with everybody on your

661
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:39,030
team

662
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:42,400
but if you get the impression that

663
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:45,940
there's just a really strong mismatch

664
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:47,940
with one two or all of the people on

665
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:50,350
that team I would say go with your gut

666
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:52,600
if it's just not a good fit it's not a

667
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:55,390
good fit it's really it's not a good or

668
00:37:52,600 --> 00:38:06,180
bad judgmental thing it's whatever fits

669
00:37:55,390 --> 00:38:06,180
best for you I hope that any else

670
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:18,250
going once going twice sold awesome

671
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:18,250
thank you all so much
