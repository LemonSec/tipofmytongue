406
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:48,290
so speaking of drink tickets those

407
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:51,500
you've been here before the drinks here

408
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:53,960
are not cheap so what we do is we

409
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:56,960
subsidize our drink costs that's why we

410
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:59,690
recommend drink tickets so drink tickets

411
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:03,860
are $8 a ticket and that will get you

412
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:06,470
any mixed drink beer wine etc five three

413
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:08,928
tickets for 35 so definitely highly

414
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:12,049
recommend buying those it will save you

415
00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:15,410
a lot of money and not on sale yeah when

416
00:19:12,049 --> 00:19:17,900

417
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:19,419
keynotes so after the keynote we'll talk

418
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:22,190

419
00:19:19,419 --> 00:19:25,429

nice that's a given our first roller or

463
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,930
150 people or something like that I

464
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:31,150
think so we've grown pretty

465
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:33,010
substantially over the years those of

466
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:34,360
you who have asked oh hey when you're

467
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:36,550
gonna have like a thousand two thousand

468
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:41,889
people the answer is hopefully never we

469
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:43,930
like to keep it small so but yeah we we

470
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:45,640
like to keep it small so we are getting

471
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:48,540
close to where our capacity is and we

472
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,540
are very happy about that

473
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:52,240
all right so almost ready for the

474
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,590

475
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,840

so now without further ado this is Amber

495
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:45,160
Welsh amber who is doing a talk on data

496
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:48,610
access rights exploits under new privacy

497
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:51,040

498
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:52,959
amber and to be our keynote we heard

499
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:55,240
phenomenal things about the talk and

500
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,070
hence we have that's why we invited

501
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:00,000
amber to or speak so without further ado

502
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:00,000
