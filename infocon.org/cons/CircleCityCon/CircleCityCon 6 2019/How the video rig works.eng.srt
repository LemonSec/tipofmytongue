1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:06,390
Joey say hello to the camera hello

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:08,370
camera this is iron geek I'm going to be

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,730
showing you how i video rig works the

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:13,649
current iteration as of Derby con 4

5
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:17,580
right here we have the camera it's a

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:19,320
mini HDMI out of it into the extreme cap

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,139
from the extreme cap it goes into one of

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,430
the USB 3 ports usually 13 is back one I

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,470
have in this front one it's working

10
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,599
actually this yeah it's working now so

11
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:30,210
I'll leave it like that right here this

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,510
is the elgato someplace I mean there is

13
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:36,750
an elgato that's a USB to capture device

14
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:41,099
it's unfortunately slightly delayed it's

15
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:44,640
getting its video feed from this given

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,170
scalar which runs VGA and HDMI and that

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,489
allows me to catch two that I'll show

18
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,559
you the software in a second because

19
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:50,760
these are all plugged in if you happen

20
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:53,730
to be plugging this thing in familiar

21
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,989
conference yellow to yellow red to red

22
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,190
if I haven't have a splitter I don't

23
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:57,660
have to split it out here right now if I

24
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:01,890
also have a box it's a four-way splitter

25
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:03,510
both green means the same feed both red

26
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,090
means the same feed but you can actually

27
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,890
swap any which way you want I will

28
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,110
sometimes have this box available this

29
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,970
is something Jason made us it clears the

30
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,189
lid hell out of ground noise let's make

31
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:15,869
sure that button is in the position you

32
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:18,929
see right now in other words the slower

33
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:22,619
part in that means it's ground lifted

34
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:24,299
and it does wonders okay that's mostly

35
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:27,479
of how all the video stuff is actually

36
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:29,040
set up i'm trifling with any components

37
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:30,990
that i don't really have newly covered

38
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,030
oh by the way you will need the special

39
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,729
cable it has the right genders to

40
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:38,159
actually be able to do the matching so

41
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:39,869
Joey let's go ahead and first of all

42
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,290
let's show them I usually have text

43
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:46,380
files on the desktop and he'll bring my

44
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,369
tripod right now Joey once movie

45
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,500
something called something something

46
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:51,450
titles might be track 1 titles whatever

47
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:56,939
these are titles you can copy and paste

48
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:59,430
them into the video I also have files

49
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:02,189
that are called like track 1 file names

50
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,659
and those are more different those are

51
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:05,309
so I will rename the files notice

52
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:06,540
there's no spaces just because I have

53
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,270
scripts set up it's easy to do it

54
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:12,840
without spaces so Joey where is let's do

55
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:15,980
this go ahead and go into

56
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:24,569
one of the titles that attract one

57
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:25,829
titles right you got that good and what

58
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:26,280
I call the first one welcome to the

59
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:32,069
family

60
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:33,569
so let's grab that oh I may have it

61
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:35,760
automatically open up in notepad next

62
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:37,410
time notepad plus plus which would have

63
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,268
done work just like Joey was trying to

64
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:43,400
write a second go all right we're gonna

65
00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:43,400
start OBS that's that little black icon

66
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:53,130
and it's up and what we can do is we hit

67
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,830
preview stream we want make sure we're

68
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:57,030
getting the speaker's a video feed we

69
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:00,780
don't can only have a video feed going

70
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:02,400
but eventually we will I switch down to

71
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,819
the second one usually main use to be

72
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,420
the most

73
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:08,220
oh you had a video feed awesome go to UM

74
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:09,510
go says this title and speaker text

75
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,910
double-click on it

76
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:16,200
we can also right click I just paste in

77
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:18,030
that title by the way if backspace in to

78
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,280
shutting down the machine or send down

79
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,079
to capture that's cuz I do go in and

80
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,910
change the configuration avoid bad

81
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:27,090
choice you can but I should have it

82
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:30,450
turned off most the time okay and that

83
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:33,420
is basically how you put the title into

84
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:35,518
your notice it's over here now too now

85
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:39,708
if we didn't stop on this check one two

86
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:43,739
we switch up two main responses

87
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:47,250
occasionally we might start up with just

88
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:48,660
speaker responses but do you mean the

89
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,150
sponsor to the main one then we hit

90
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,230
start recording so now add one do you

91
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:54,450
mean those in the background this is

92
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:56,130
John Doe Simba that goes away with a

93
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:58,589
little bit of time I usually leave the

94
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:01,380
sponsors up until it goes away so then I

95
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:04,380
switch down to the next one the one says

96
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:06,329
main use me the most normally that's the

97
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,400
best one however there are some

98
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:09,989
exceptions for instance if those black

99
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,019
balls in the right and left hand side

100
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:14,190
you go to buy for by free fix now in

101
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:16,918
this case it actually cuts off warning

102
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:19,620
you want and open up my video guys

103
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:22,469
playing how you doing alright this other

104
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,229
one side well wide split this is good if

105
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,170
the speakers are Roman like all hell

106
00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:28,539
that's probably gonna be on for

107
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:30,730
intro after we do the initial sponsor

108
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:34,180
CAPTCHA they might have speaker big

109
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:36,610
screen small which basically emphasizes

110
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,600
the speaker over the slide some people

111
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,340
slides aren't that important and they

112
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,760
move a lot and then just speaker's

113
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:45,400
laptop just speaker just speaker

114
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:47,650
responses I stopped that off at the if

115
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,239
that's it and then I also have blank if

116
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:51,460
it looks like a spot I need a blank out

117
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:54,310
just the video the audio hopefully is

118
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:56,440
still going at that time but don't

119
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:59,440
guarantee on that alright let's go back

120
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:01,600
up to main responses and that's the one

121
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,850
we're gonna have most of the time now

122
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,320
whenever you stop recording and I don't

123
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:07,210
know I'd only just stop recording while

124
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:12,010
I'm still in the main use me the most

125
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:13,659
hit stop recording and then I shrink

126
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:18,760
this down I'll move it aside I don't

127
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:23,950
believe it fullscreen great and I ripped

128
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:28,450
my file names and file names I copy them

129
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:31,060
out and then I rename the file whether

130
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:32,500
the appropriate file name is and then

131
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,480
I'll come around and collect them later

132
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,740
on

133
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:39,010
now a few other tips to give you on

134
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:40,930
these template over 768 is a sweet spot

135
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:42,520
for most things these new gifts and

136
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:44,320
scalars will scale just about anything I

137
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:49,450
send that them but there is a little tip

138
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:52,180
here this is a little button here that

139
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:54,310
you can double tap and it will do an

140
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,000
auto adjust and if things are slightly

141
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,100
misaligned

142
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,050
it generally figures it out and will

143
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:01,060
realign it you have a small black bar

144
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:03,580
not the big black bars like it's doing 4

145
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,770
by 3 and 16 by 9 but double tapping on

146
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,570
that will generate Penza also keep in

147
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:11,590
mind go ahead and start the preview up

148
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:14,380
again well in preview or recording your

149
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:15,820
notice that things are slightly delayed

150
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:20,110
from what you'll actually see on the

151
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:21,880
screen don't worry about it it's just

152
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:24,010
the way it is because of how I have to

153
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:26,290
do an offset I'm one set set up also

154
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:28,390
normally I put the speaker on the far

155
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:30,670
left hand side of the screen if I'm in

156
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:32,620
the normal mode while I'm doing picture

157
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:34,510
in the picture so don't expect them to

158
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:36,280
be here in the center expect them here

159
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:38,260
and just kind of watch the video for you

160
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,888
because occasionally so if some reason

161
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:41,830
up these

162
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:43,539
Lia's freeze-up also watch this audio

163
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,859
coming in I don't think we have an audio

164
00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:47,289
feed right now would you switch the

165
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:49,150
audio motion there but we remember

166
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:52,748
slightly delayed from whatever the

167
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:55,710
speakers doing and that's pretty much it

168
00:06:52,749 --> 00:06:55,710
thank you much
