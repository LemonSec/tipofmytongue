1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,160
like freakin aeroplanes you know when

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:11,910
you don't hack the stupid things they're

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:13,590
late all I'm gonna say all right so what

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:17,580
do we go with analysis aren't we so this

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:19,020
is not gonna be a technical technical

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:24,448
talk if you expected me to have

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:25,830
conversations about okay we just turned

8
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:28,170
it there we go if we're gonna have a

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,060
conversation about breaking ships or

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,040
airplanes or anything outside that this

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,269
is not the one today so this is actually

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,079
something very different it's bit more

13
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:38,489
of an introspective conversation as it

14
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,800
says we're gonna have a little bit of a

15
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:42,870
conversation about a number of different

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,959
things so for those of you how many of

17
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,730
you don't know me here can i bypass this

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,079
yes okay I really must have broken

19
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:53,640
anything at everything and I've annoyed

20
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:55,260
most agencies I shrink is an

21
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,910
understatement normally I have the

22
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,289
whiskey suitcase thankfully I did not

23
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,819
bring the whiskey suitcase so otherwise

24
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:03,570
I'd probably still stuck up a freaking

25
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:07,470
hour for so here's the other players in

26
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:10,590
today's conversation about a year that a

27
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:13,979
year ago urine change ago end up looking

28
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,330
after a friend's name and they were

29
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:16,920
going through some problems so end up

30
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,270
taking over this year old Great Dane

31
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,590
that was like about I've never actually

32
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:25,020
I've had a dog once before when I was a

33
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,369
kid and I've had exes who have had dogs

34
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,979
that I've kind of looked after off for a

35
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:33,229
while but their exes they don't camp but

36
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:37,829
this time around this was we rescued the

37
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:40,350
smaller one their Daisy who's about 125

38
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:42,119
pound and about four months later we got

39
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,729
a phone call from the people that vetted

40
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:48,149
us that they hey we have another dog you

41
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:51,960
interested and we're like well you know

42
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:54,420
maybe so a four month old puppy turned

43
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:58,320
up the four month old puppy is now a

44
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:01,979
year older than 150 pound we also have a

45
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,289
snack sized dog literally a chew toy and

46
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:06,240
this is really about them and it's about

47
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,340
the conversations and thoughts around by

48
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,480
them and so this is the logic behind

49
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,030
this as an industry we have our own

50
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,440
share of

51
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:16,000
challenges and number of us have stood

52
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,590
up and talked about a number of people

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,590
over this weekend we'll probably do two

54
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:22,600
more talks about it but as everybody

55
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:26,110
probably knows I tend to rant about it

56
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:28,359
rather a lot this isn't about the

57
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:30,340
industry and as I said here's your

58
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,750
get-out-of-jail-free card if you wanted

59
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,670
to have a conversation about breaking

60
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,720
shit you're welcome to leave if you want

61
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:37,890
to just carry on having nice

62
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:43,750
conversations in whiskey we can stay

63
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:46,899
it's me I'm broken all of us in this

64
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:48,850
industry probably arguably are a little

65
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:51,040
broken in one way shape form or another

66
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:55,150
but here's the difference and here's the

67
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:57,310
challenge I don't need somebody to come

68
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,360
and fix me or analyze me I sure as hell

69
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,040
don't want somebody to give me a

70
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,390
freaking pep talk that really doesn't

71
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:05,920
work taser

72
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:10,000
maybe pep talk no I don't need more bad

73
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,390
advice I've had my fair share did I

74
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,989
break it

75
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:15,609
I've shared quite a lot of it publicly

76
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:17,739
but what I do need and what I was

77
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:20,530
looking for and what the dogs have kind

78
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:23,650
of brought is this whole somebody or

79
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:25,510
something to be there somebody to have

80
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:27,880
my six a lot of us a former military

81
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:30,190
former Intel and for me when I had a

82
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:33,459
team around me I didn't care it was a

83
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:34,930
family the dogs got abroad that and for

84
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:37,049
me it was also somebody to share things

85
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:39,220
with the biscuits and everything else

86
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:40,600
but here's the thing for those of you

87
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:45,989
who know me know that I've got other

88
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:48,220
people but this is really what I wanted

89
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:50,739
somebody that cuddle up and hug up with

90
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,880
air in an again and here's a caveat that

91
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:55,239
goes with that though

92
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:57,790
a lot of us probably want the same thing

93
00:03:55,239 --> 00:04:00,370
but the big one on here is I took

94
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:01,690
probably six months to figure out

95
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:04,090
whether it was the right thing to do

96
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:06,670
having not owned dogs before and having

97
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:09,190
looked after this 130 hundred and forty

98
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:11,108
pound Dame before and seen the size of

99
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:15,430
the piles it leaves in the fucking

100
00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:17,560
garden every five minutes and going do I

101
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,630
really want to deal with this four seven

102
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,630
eight nine years

103
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:24,840
of a dog's life there are poop services

104
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:26,760
by the way they don't charge much and

105
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,349
it's really useful and the amount of dog

106
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,150
food this bloody thing eats only man

107
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:32,850
slobber it leaves at every single

108
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:34,409
surface around the house and I'm like do

109
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:36,900
I really want this and this I guess

110
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:40,050
absolutely and then I'm like shit I

111
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:43,739
travel all the time how am I gonna deal

112
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:45,270
with this and like I got a daughter I

113
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,370
got other people in my life I got people

114
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:48,870
that look after me but the difference is

115
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,840
this isn't their fight this was

116
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:53,550
something I want there to do for me and

117
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,900
so it's kinda like okay how do we do

118
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:57,570
this is this something I can balance

119
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:59,219
about to that reasoning thing better the

120
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,719
things that we do on a regular basis but

121
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,150
sometimes we don't necessarily do it

122
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,110
until after we've left off the freaking

123
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:10,320
cliff I'm one of those people sometimes

124
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:11,820
so this is a reflective look over 12

125
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:18,090
months worth of fun and games with the

126
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:21,030
dogs after 12 months holy shit they can

127
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:24,419
see right into your soul this is one of

128
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:28,469
the biggest things for me be true to who

129
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:30,240
you really are in our industry in the

130
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:33,720
work that we do in the way we present

131
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,630
ourselves sometimes we put personas on

132
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,370
sometimes I mean there are all sorts of

133
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,840
people on I have the purple beard and

134
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,490
the crazy shit normally I've got a kilt

135
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,150
on but going through security today I'm

136
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:48,600
like let's take it easy

137
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:51,510
freedom fumbles yeah but it was like

138
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,250
okay I need to be true to who I am if

139
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,630
I'm going to do this how can I do this

140
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,550
and this one

141
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:57,990
Daisy especially really looks into the

142
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:59,700
salt my love he doesn't really look into

143
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:02,070
soul as long as you've got a chew toy or

144
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:05,159
in my case these two bracelets that I

145
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:11,159
have in my hand I am the chew toy he's

146
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:12,960
pretty good the intelligence this is an

147
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,450
interesting one again how many of you

148
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,859
have had kids all got kids or pets and

149
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:19,920
it really it kind of counts the same way

150
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:22,380
at the moment this is interesting for

151
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:25,050
what we do and how we do how can we

152
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:28,260
explain it in such a way that these guys

153
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:29,820
understand it how do we explain the work

154
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,729
that we do how do we explain the life

155
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,680
and the world that

156
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:34,389
you live in and we're bringing up in a

157
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,559
way that these guys get it the same way

158
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:38,020
that we can do it too the same with the

159
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:39,669
kids for us is the intelligence side of

160
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,650
it we have that intelligence we have

161
00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:44,469
that ability we have the knowledge of

162
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:47,229
our own industry and for so many years

163
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:49,150
we held on to that knowledge now the

164
00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:51,818
challenge for all of us is how do we

165
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:54,068
impart that knowledge to everybody else

166
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:56,169
one of the biggest conquer issues we

167
00:06:54,069 --> 00:06:58,360
have and Cathy's here with us as well

168
00:06:56,169 --> 00:07:01,029
cos she and I did a talk was talking

169
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,939
about communication to different people

170
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:04,479
in the organizations we've not been good

171
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:06,969
at it

172
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,990
get a dog it's amazing how quickly you

173
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:11,229
actually get used to trying to

174
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:12,930
communicate with the damn things this is

175
00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:15,938
one of the other things I learnt as well

176
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:17,800
by watching them I am mister leaping off

177
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:20,499
the cliff and figuring shit out on the

178
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:24,689
way down while watching these guys it's

179
00:07:20,499 --> 00:07:28,029
crazy observe orient decide and then act

180
00:07:24,689 --> 00:07:29,919
most of the time the puppy will

181
00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:31,199
occasionally just act anyway and then

182
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:34,359
hope for the best

183
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:37,240
Daisy who is we rescued her she was four

184
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:39,819
years old she's now just turned five she

185
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:44,099
will sit there plan and fit this stuff

186
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:46,810
out and then she acts and she's mean and

187
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:48,520
chase did we I don't have any squirrels

188
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:54,069
we don't have many rabbits and the cats

189
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:55,870
leave us alone now this is great holy

190
00:07:54,069 --> 00:08:00,550
shit this has been awesome if I could

191
00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:02,499
take these guys on pen tests the rest of

192
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:03,849
our social engineering skills would just

193
00:08:02,499 --> 00:08:05,770
go out of the window I mean we have

194
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:09,219
funny feet we have colored ears

195
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:11,609
we have pipes that we use we have hands

196
00:08:09,219 --> 00:08:15,789
full of shit note just take a damn dog

197
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:19,209
it's easy I was at a March

198
00:08:15,789 --> 00:08:21,669
a ruck march for charity this last

199
00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:22,839
weekend and I took Micah with me and

200
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:24,849
he's now here about a hundred and forty

201
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:26,589
five hundred and fifty pound he was like

202
00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:28,419
the star of a show you got all these SF

203
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:30,999
guys all began talking that's it the

204
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:34,750
fucking babies around this thing it was

205
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:38,380
cute as all hell to see and with that

206
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:43,669
comes this this is also something we're

207
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:45,800
not good at doing as humans we're

208
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:47,599
get in our own comfort zone we get in

209
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,479
our own rut we get in that way of doing

210
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:53,000
life and we don't always like stepping

211
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,650
outside of that comfort zone yeah when

212
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,140
you take a step back and especially this

213
00:08:54,650 --> 00:09:00,800
lunatic we've snow for the first time in

214
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:03,800
Colorado he just plowed straight in

215
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,120
started eating it it's like a shovel it

216
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,459
just kind of went along and there's this

217
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:11,150
trowel of drool and snow throughout the

218
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:14,210
rest of the house but as humans we're

219
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:16,100
not good at doing that we like to

220
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:18,590
sometimes even though we in our own

221
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:20,390
industry a good or breaking rules we

222
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:22,340
don't necessarily step outside of the

223
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:24,949
comfort of those ones that we want to

224
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:27,620
break how can we mentally challenge

225
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:28,820
ourselves to maybe look at things a

226
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:31,850
little differently and it takes

227
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:34,280
different experiences this one's

228
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:37,840
probably one of my favorites and also

229
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:41,569
one of my challenges I like my vibrance

230
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:43,760
Milo likes my vibrance I locked my

231
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:46,430
vibrance in a room my life figured out

232
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,069
how to open the stupid room I put them

233
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:51,199
rings on the shelf he figured I had a

234
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:53,330
knock down a suitcase stand on the

235
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:58,310
stupid thing and still get to the ruddy

236
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:59,270
vibrance so we have to a bit of a war

237
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:01,520
and peace thing

238
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:05,079
the blue ones which he likes I now have

239
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:11,210
two pests he gets one pet and

240
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:14,660
occasionally I get the other pet but

241
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:17,950
again try try again

242
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:20,420
try something different as pentesters

243
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:22,700
one of the things we always used to do

244
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:24,140
to train people and to test people we

245
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:27,200
would put them in front of a building

246
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:30,110
and say give me ten different ways to

247
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:34,550
get into that building some people would

248
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:38,030
be like well front door back door window

249
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:39,589
shit I'm stuck train the fucking

250
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:41,480
squirrels to come in through the roof

251
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:44,950
and steal the keys and come out through

252
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:47,360
the front door I don't care what you do

253
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:49,610
but take a different sorry

254
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,060
where's we bends in here I will try to

255
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:58,190
restrict the language I apologize oh

256
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:59,500
darn it all to heck try to think about

257
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:02,210
things from a different perspective

258
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:04,430
interviews one of the things we always

259
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:05,930
used to do with interviews I normally

260
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,900
have it if I'm not drinking whisky I've

261
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:11,239
none we got a cup of tea in my hand I

262
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:13,189
put that cup of tea down on a table and

263
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,560
each one of you test yourself this way I

264
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:18,050
put the cup of tea down on a table and

265
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:22,699
then I'd ask the person I was interview

266
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:28,069
and give me ten ways to get the tea out

267
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:29,990
of that cup just ten ways there would be

268
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:31,580
amazing how many people in our industry

269
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:33,110
or wanting to be in our industry

270
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:36,080
couldn't get past five or six different

271
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:38,270
ways so each one of you just test

272
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:41,210
yourself put a cup down in front of you

273
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:43,340
and figure out ten different ways to get

274
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:46,130
the tea out of that cup I don't care

275
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:48,410
wild harebrained asks about face turn

276
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:50,210
gravity off whatever you want to do but

277
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:52,310
figure out different ways of doing it

278
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:56,830
because that's exactly what that bugger

279
00:11:52,310 --> 00:12:00,020
did to get to my damn vibrance this one

280
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:02,360
Cathy and I gave this talk this is an

281
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:04,370
updated version had communicated with a

282
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:07,310
hundred and forty five pound puppy that

283
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:09,200
also likes your daughter's shoes and try

284
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:11,869
to explain that no they shouldn't be

285
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,620
eating the whatever the hell madam ish

286
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,240
chewy

287
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:19,930
young apparently Steve Madden makes

288
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:23,540
really chewy shoes but the big one here

289
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:26,030
again dealing with the woof ma there's

290
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:28,670
no subtlety there's no there's no

291
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:32,449
passiveness there's nothing like that be

292
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:35,479
up front be truthful but communicate

293
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:39,830
effectively something we should all

294
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:41,510
learn now for those of us that came out

295
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:44,360
of the military this is another version

296
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:45,680
of that I'll let you read it what I

297
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:56,930
liked looks like

298
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:59,810
ah fricking toilet rolls this idiot in

299
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:02,449
front of you you know the kitchen tells

300
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:05,300
the toilet holes yeah we played with

301
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:07,820
those that were fun to play with then he

302
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:10,729
realized that inside a toilet roll is

303
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:13,810
exactly the same cardboard freaking tube

304
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:18,050
and they're dotted all over the house

305
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:22,729
and he can help himself so we did there

306
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:25,579
are numerous pictures of this again as

307
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:28,520
our industry sees the day eat the night

308
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:31,270
whatever an analogy you want to use on

309
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:33,620
this one this is our industry make it

310
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:37,520
have some fun with it do some

311
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:39,290
interesting stuff with it this was a fun

312
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,699
one and this is you know a lot of people

313
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:43,790
talk to me about how to get into the

314
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:45,529
industry me it's find the passion find

315
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:47,449
something that interest you find out

316
00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:49,279
what you want to do there's villages

317
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:51,589
around the corner here there's all sorts

318
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:55,730
of interesting stuff get involved and

319
00:13:51,589 --> 00:13:58,040
just do shit and break it figure out how

320
00:13:55,730 --> 00:14:01,880
you broke it make it again and then

321
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:06,079
break it an entirely different way as it

322
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:09,800
says try again as you might notice he

323
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:11,270
has one of my Vibrams again he this I

324
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,890
think was I don't remember there's so

325
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:14,569
many freaking times he's got my vibrance

326
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:17,029
it's not even funny I found them buried

327
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:18,770
in the garden I feel like I need to put

328
00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:24,529
those little tracking things on the damn

329
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:32,779
things these days this is a big one we

330
00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:35,120
all screw up take that responsibility we

331
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:36,670
all like you get praise hey didn't

332
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,839
awesome job well thank you

333
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:41,750
but sometimes we need to put our own

334
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:44,870
hand up and go hey we screw it up

335
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:48,260
we got something wrong I learned from it

336
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:51,170
and I want to share it that's the other

337
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:53,120
big one again for those either follow me

338
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:55,160
on LinkedIn I put a lot of stuff out and

339
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,920
I'll occasionally put my hand up and go

340
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,089
look I goofed up I screwed up I did it

341
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,949
with the owl stuff I've done

342
00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:03,649
with the aviation stuff at the number of

343
00:15:00,949 --> 00:15:05,449
other things the logic here is I want

344
00:15:03,649 --> 00:15:09,920
everybody else to learn from that and

345
00:15:05,449 --> 00:15:13,748
make entirely different mistakes if we

346
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,748
all did that might be in a better place

347
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:21,499
this is a biggie I like to think of

348
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:23,059
myself as being able to multitask but

349
00:15:21,499 --> 00:15:25,370
let's be honest more often than not

350
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:26,509
we're kind of fooling ourselves we're

351
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:29,110
really good at spreading ourselves

352
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:32,720
really thin on lots of different things

353
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:35,899
watching these guys one task one thing

354
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,569
one thing at a time and it's amazing how

355
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:43,100
much stuff they get done some of it's a

356
00:15:38,569 --> 00:15:46,689
little destructive some of it is pretty

357
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:49,730
amazing but there's no procrastination

358
00:15:46,689 --> 00:15:51,860
there's no faffing around there's just

359
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:54,769
I've got a job to do I'm gonna bloody

360
00:15:51,860 --> 00:16:04,790
well get on and do it we can learn a lot

361
00:15:54,769 --> 00:16:09,009
from that again a lot of us hide behind

362
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:11,449
something a shield there are some times

363
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:13,699
sometimes you just gotta say fucking

364
00:16:11,449 --> 00:16:18,410
screw it sod it whatever other language

365
00:16:13,699 --> 00:16:20,540
you want to use darn it damn it trip the

366
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:25,160
light fantastic through the mall through

367
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:29,269
the business that gives a damn but be

368
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:32,660
true to yourself you know we talk a lot

369
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:34,249
in this industry about mental health and

370
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:36,019
I think a lot of it some of it is

371
00:16:34,249 --> 00:16:37,790
because we're not always true to

372
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:39,649
ourselves we try to fit we try to

373
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:41,689
conform we try to do the right things

374
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:43,519
when we come to circle city con another

375
00:16:41,689 --> 00:16:45,620
conferences we get to do crazy stuff

376
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,290
every now again for a couple of days if

377
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:50,899
that's not working and if it isn't a

378
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:52,639
good enough of an outlet then maybe take

379
00:16:50,899 --> 00:16:55,160
that step back and go what I'm like what

380
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,990
can I do differently for me I know what

381
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:59,929
I figured out I'd used to train I train

382
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:02,029
for the Olympics or hammer throwing and

383
00:16:59,929 --> 00:17:03,949
I did pretty well at it and then I took

384
00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:06,349
a break I got older my body was like

385
00:17:03,949 --> 00:17:08,480
screw you you can't carry 320 pounds

386
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:12,679
weight and neither can you push you know

387
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:14,180
squatting 1200 or something yeah

388
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,650
and the body was like nope can't do it

389
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,820
so I took a break and then what got in

390
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:19,310
the way and everything else got over and

391
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:20,720
then mentally I just went douche off the

392
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:22,760
freaking cliff for about four or five

393
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,470
years beginning of this year after

394
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,109
having these guys and watching these for

395
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:29,180
about six months I'm like you know uh I

396
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:30,919
need to change I realized that I'm not

397
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:33,230
happy with myself and I realize it needs

398
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:36,260
to be a me thing so I started working at

399
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:38,390
again several times a week I leave my

400
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:40,550
phone in the damn car and I go hit the

401
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:42,110
gym phone stays in the car I use a

402
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:45,200
flippin iPod shuffle

403
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:46,879
I went low-tech because nobody can get

404
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,800
me on frickin Bluetooth and nobody can

405
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,680
ping me my I don't even have a stupid

406
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:56,210
Apple fo Apple what do you think it's

407
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:58,910
simple I took time for me to do what I

408
00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:00,920
wanted to do my way I go to the gym and

409
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:03,050
my studying pajamas and a scruffy

410
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:05,980
t-shirt and there's everybody there

411
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:08,030
fancying around the latest bloody

412
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:09,310
Lululemon or whatever the hell I make no

413
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:15,460
that's not who I am

414
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:18,310
so be true to yourself this one I like

415
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:20,410
we talked about in our industry I

416
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:23,210
lecture on it

417
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:26,180
gonna get your ass handed to you you're

418
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:28,400
gonna get breached get a plan well the

419
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:32,360
same thing applies in human life with

420
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:34,010
dogs you can really try to get

421
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:36,590
everything right and then shit goes

422
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:39,320
wrong in the case of the bottom right

423
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:41,540
hand side that was that was Theo the one

424
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:45,110
that we were looking after him alone for

425
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:46,909
a little bit he ate his bed Daisy did

426
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:49,610
the same thing but she ended up at she

427
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:51,680
eating one of the chairs she ate the

428
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:54,530
cushion half of one of the arms which

429
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:57,140
was wood one of the legs and a few other

430
00:18:54,530 --> 00:19:01,250
bits yeah kind of cool management

431
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:07,100
failure can't blame the dog management

432
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:13,850
failure take responsibility something we

433
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:16,610
don't do patience or Eve they and I'm

434
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:19,760
one of the worst I am more than happy to

435
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:21,800
taser somebody at a moment's notice it's

436
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,870
kind of fun to do especially the new

437
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,159
ones that have got three prongs you can

438
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,770
get people to hold hands with those

439
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:31,070
they're quite fun to do

440
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:33,920
but this is awesome patience is key it's

441
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:37,159
amazing to watch the dogs and see how

442
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:39,770
they work how patient they can be how

443
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:43,550
damn determined and Steely IB can be

444
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:46,930
especially when there's bacon or peanut

445
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:50,000
butter Girl Scout cookies involved

446
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:52,100
either one of those and it's fair game

447
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:58,160
and I know I'm gonna lose this just how

448
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:59,719
long I can hold out for so let's take a

449
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,490
look at the human aspect this was from

450
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,850
the dogs aspect is everybody doing okay

451
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:06,380
so far everybody all right with this ten

452
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:07,820
a number we can break stuff as well I

453
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:09,140
promise it we've got five minutes left

454
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:14,090
at the end will hack the hotel or

455
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:15,950
something so this is the human aspect

456
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:19,699
this is looking at it from our

457
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:22,220
perspective so in working and watching

458
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:26,030
the dogs three dogs two big-ass damn

459
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:29,150
dogs and one snack as far as everybody's

460
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:31,310
concerned they're all the same the snack

461
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:33,290
sized dog thinks she's about the same

462
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:36,950
size as the big one and the big one

463
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:41,980
apparently wants to be a lap dog but

464
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:44,720
they accept each other for who they are

465
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:47,090
for the strengths that they bring for

466
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:51,650
the weaknesses that they have they

467
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:55,459
accept them for that why can't we do the

468
00:20:51,650 --> 00:21:00,020
same what is the challenges and why do

469
00:20:55,460 --> 00:21:04,670
we not have that same capability each

470
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:08,120
one of us are challenged you change this

471
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:11,600
one especially our industry the

472
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:13,399
importance of boundaries oh yeah haven't

473
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:17,090
we had some discussions on this over the

474
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:21,530
years so let's just keep it simple we

475
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:24,320
all need to recognize boundaries we all

476
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:26,899
need to communicate those boundaries and

477
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:29,030
we all need to be able to re respectful

478
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,740
of those boundaries needless to say

479
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:32,300
these are the two woof mutts helping

480
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:34,790
reduce and typing the other day

481
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:36,230
not quite boundary recognition

482
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:40,010
especially when you end it with slime

483
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:42,559
all over the keyboard so

484
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:45,000
this follows on from the first one I

485
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:49,820
think in our industry were better than

486
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:52,860
most but as humans we have a lot to do I

487
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:55,408
noticed when I took Milo to the ruck

488
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,879
march there are a bunch of folks in

489
00:21:55,409 --> 00:21:58,799
wheelchairs there are a bunch of folks

490
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,210
who've been blown to bits and there were

491
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,710
bits missing that they'd probably left

492
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:05,940
in the sandbox and various other places

493
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:08,340
he didn't give a shit he just went up to

494
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:09,990
everybody wanted an ear scratch wanted

495
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:14,100
to say hi wanted to leave a little

496
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:22,559
slobber trail we need to take a leaf out

497
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:24,209
of that this one is huge especially when

498
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:27,629
dealing with a hundred and forty five

499
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:29,309
pound dog for me I have no problem when

500
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:31,100
he jumps up on me I got no problem he

501
00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:35,580
wrestles me I got no issues with that

502
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:38,100
but that's me I have a problem if he was

503
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:39,510
to jump up on somebody else I sure as

504
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,189
hell have a problem if he decides he

505
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:42,480
wants to arm-wrestle my daughter or

506
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:45,029
anything else like that let alone

507
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,159
friends in the neighborhood so I have to

508
00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:50,130
be able to communicate effectively with

509
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:52,649
him what he's allowed to do and how he's

510
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:55,200
allowed to do it and I do it typically

511
00:22:52,649 --> 00:22:57,570
with sign language and I do it a lot

512
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:02,220
with nonverbal communications with cues

513
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:04,408
with positive reinforcement I go through

514
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:07,230
more freaking snacks and dog chews than

515
00:23:04,409 --> 00:23:10,110
I care to think of but the only person

516
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:12,240
who jumps up on is me the only times he

517
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:14,580
does it is when I pat my chest or when I

518
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,500
do this on a few other things then any

519
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:20,010
times he wrestles is when I put my arm

520
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:24,149
up and I beckon to him etc etc etc we've

521
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:26,460
learned these things so all of us need

522
00:23:24,149 --> 00:23:28,918
to learn the cues and everything else as

523
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:30,690
we work inside our own world the social

524
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:32,909
engineering world is huge on this one

525
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:34,440
you look at I mean leras is out there

526
00:23:32,909 --> 00:23:36,539
you look or what nickerson is doing you

527
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,919
look at what had Nadia doing you look at

528
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:41,010
all of these other people in our own

529
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:42,960
industry who are teaching nonverbal who

530
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:45,510
are teaching social engineering skills

531
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,429
this is using exactly the same thing

532
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:50,789
with a hundred and forty five pound

533
00:23:47,429 --> 00:23:51,570
puppy it's fun and it puts it to the

534
00:23:50,789 --> 00:23:53,020
test

535
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:55,000
and it's been in

536
00:23:53,020 --> 00:24:04,240
testing one of the things we should

537
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:07,690
probably all try this is a biggie - a

538
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:10,060
biggie for me because I get angry I get

539
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:12,010
frustrated very easily sometimes and

540
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:14,230
then I don't want to take that out on

541
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:16,570
anybody or anything how many of us have

542
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:18,700
sent an email we've gone hash it I

543
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:22,450
probably shouldn't have said that yeah

544
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:25,120
yeah rage quit anybody rage quit yeah

545
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:29,110
okay maybe afterwards you should have

546
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:30,760
taken that step back and gone I really

547
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:33,189
wanted to do it but yeah I probably

548
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:35,100
should have done it's been really

549
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:38,980
interesting working with the woof mutts

550
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:42,010
to work out how emotions work with them

551
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:45,100
to work out how they perceive emotions

552
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:46,360
and to work out how we can put a face

553
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:48,010
forward to them as the same thing

554
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:52,479
dealing with humans something we should

555
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:54,760
think about effectively this is an

556
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,380
interesting one so there's a couple of

557
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,690
reasons for throwing this one up and it

558
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:00,190
isn't just a warm-up based one I simply

559
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:01,690
got on LinkedIn the other day and no I

560
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:03,700
didn't bring a friend with me to this

561
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:06,040
conference but I want to Rocky Mountain

562
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:08,950
Inn for a second eight-week but this is

563
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:10,240
really I put something out and I'm like

564
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:11,860
hey we all need to get out there we all

565
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,840
need to help this is an industry that

566
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:16,120
has to grow and we have to bring the

567
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,580
next generation along and somebody

568
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:20,050
responded to me going well how the heck

569
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:22,210
it wasn't like I don't get out of my

570
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:23,500
cave and I don't go to conferences and

571
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:24,970
this is somebody who's actually pretty

572
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:27,370
well you're pretty good in the industry

573
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:30,070
and I challenge that one like one your

574
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:31,780
pain in the ass because you have all

575
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:35,230
this knowledge and you're not sharing it

576
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:38,680
and secondly get out of your own freakin

577
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:42,820
head come to these kinds of places and

578
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:46,360
talk with people listen to people get a

579
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:48,820
different perspective now is that an

580
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:51,219
industry conference the other day and

581
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:52,659
they were bemoaning about the fact they

582
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:54,760
weren't enough people in the industry

583
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:57,460
I'm like how many of you have gone down

584
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:59,320
the unemployment line and walked up and

585
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:00,700
down the unemployment line saying hey do

586
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:03,010
we have any pipe fitters to have any

587
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:05,590
plumbers do evany 50 60 year old

588
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:08,250
flooring people why don't we bring them

589
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:11,620
into the industry

590
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:14,260
totally different perspective we can

591
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:18,790
teach the tech no problem that's easy

592
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:20,190
shit to T then the drive and the fact

593
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:23,170
that my microphone goes out every noggin

594
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:26,500
it's the person the drive that we're

595
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:30,220
looking for I had one of my best friends

596
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:31,720
works on the railways similar aids to me

597
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:35,890
a couple is younger than I am

598
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:38,050
big Nebraska boy big Nebraska boy but he

599
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:39,610
and I have collaborated on breaking so

600
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:42,340
much shit it's not even funny

601
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:45,610
and the amazing thing is his perspective

602
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:49,510
has helped hugely so my challenge again

603
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:53,740
to everybody here is get out get

604
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:57,790
involved stay involved and talk to

605
00:26:53,740 --> 00:27:00,010
people who aren't in our industry about

606
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:00,940
what we do in a language that they

607
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:03,580
understand

608
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:09,030
not that we're comfortable with but that

609
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:13,810
they understand all right

610
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:19,230
hard on the matter so we're the sake

611
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:22,540
stuff comes in the need for a good hug

612
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:25,630
it's hard for me yeah that wasn't really

613
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:29,740
a hug that's more of a smother that's

614
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:32,500
the recover to chair after Daisy decided

615
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:34,360
to eat the damn thing ended up giving it

616
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:39,550
to somebody saying can you repair this

617
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:41,229
needs like bits but this is huge for me

618
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:43,240
again you know we all have our own

619
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:45,760
demons

620
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:48,700
and for me being able to hang out with

621
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:52,150
him and Daisy especially and just curl

622
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:54,300
up with them for 20 seconds the world

623
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:57,940
just goes away

624
00:27:54,300 --> 00:28:00,490
it's amazing how easy it is to face it

625
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:05,230
afterwards even if you are a little bit

626
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:08,320
slobbered up this is when I fail at on

627
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:09,880
almost a daily basis given the fact that

628
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,560
I think I finished doing stuff this

629
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,720
morning at about 3 o'clock on my alarm

630
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:15,490
went off that I think six are called for

631
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:19,720
a plane that handedly didn't leave until

632
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:22,150
nine o'clock seriously

633
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:24,730
how many of you feel you get enough

634
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:29,250
sleep in this industry you do I hate you

635
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:36,419
I don't love you now

636
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:39,789
none of us so again put yourself first

637
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:42,880
this is one of these times when we have

638
00:28:39,789 --> 00:28:44,760
to be selfish because if we're not we're

639
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,460
not going to succeed we will burn out

640
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:51,429
have issues mental and physical and it

641
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:53,200
sucks when they used to have owl they

642
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:55,059
would find me curled up under the table

643
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,159
sometimes I take power naps under my

644
00:28:55,059 --> 00:28:59,530
table not the best thing to do but it

645
00:28:57,159 --> 00:29:00,970
really worked but it is definitely one

646
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:02,770
of those things I've learned from the

647
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:05,320
woof mutts that it's really nice

648
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:07,150
sometimes just to curl up and ignore the

649
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:09,070
world for 30 seconds or a couple of

650
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:11,470
minutes in this case that's my

651
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:18,370
daughter's area that is a six foot

652
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:19,690
beanbag by the way yeah and that's the

653
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:22,418
smaller of the tube

654
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:24,460
she's she claims that Susan if she

655
00:29:22,419 --> 00:29:26,020
doesn't take that over in the room

656
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:28,240
that's over here is the spare room

657
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:30,129
she'll come up on the spare bed and the

658
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,490
dude that do first one will turn up on

659
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:32,490
that one

660
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:41,740
I questioned myself probably this on a

661
00:29:37,059 --> 00:29:44,280
daily basis and it makes me horribly in

662
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:46,870
terribly respect the hell out of them

663
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:49,020
that they're loved and what they do and

664
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:51,820
how they care is absolutely

665
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:54,460
unconditional they don't care if you've

666
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:57,100
had a good day a bad day they they will

667
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:58,809
listen to the ends about your clients

668
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:00,639
and the reports and the crap that you've

669
00:29:58,809 --> 00:30:02,379
got to deal with and they will just sit

670
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,580
there and they'll listen now you will

671
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:07,000
have to pay them with a Girl Scout

672
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:09,510
cookie or something as well but they'll

673
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:14,850
listen and the other thing they do and

674
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:19,510
they've taught me a fair amount is this

675
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:21,389
I'm still a long way from being able to

676
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:23,890
say I know what the hell I'm doing here

677
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:25,659
but it is sorry I know I keep walking in

678
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:27,549
front of that bloody thing it's only to

679
00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:29,740
annoy a jury Adrian's gone he's given up

680
00:30:27,549 --> 00:30:35,210

682
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:40,280
to annoy him sometimes it's fun I also

683
00:30:38,299 --> 00:30:42,290
can't stand still until they I don't

684
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:45,080
know how many people can but anyway this

685
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:48,260
is a biggie and it's back to that saying

686
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:50,299
thank you how many of you fly regular

687

basis semi regular basis a lot of us

688
00:30:50,299 --> 00:30:54,200
when you get off the airplane do you

689
00:30:52,669 --> 00:30:57,070
just stick your head into the cabin and

690
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:59,630

thank you for helping thank you for

694
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:08,200
being there one of the things that

695
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:11,870
frustrates the hell out of me about

696
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:13,820
people in general is we tend to think in

697
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:17,659
hierarchical structures I came from a

698
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:20,330
country that had hierarchy my father was

699
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:22,429
military and he was enlisted so as far

700
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:25,549
as anybody else was concerned he was on

701
00:31:22,429 --> 00:31:28,280
the bottom I dated when I was a kid I

702
00:31:25,549 --> 00:31:30,679
dated an officer's daughter that did not

703
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:34,149
go down well with the father you're

704
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:38,299
dating an enlisted boy yeah not pretty

705
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:40,460
we thinking hierarchies and as adults we

706
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:42,980
tend to do the same thing to stop that

707
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:46,700
the person the empties the rubbish bin

708
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:49,070
at night is the same person and the same

709
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:50,929
person that serves you food should have

710
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:53,178
the same equality in the same equity

711
00:31:50,929 --> 00:31:56,210
stake as leadership in anybody else

712
00:31:53,179 --> 00:31:57,679
we're all freakin equal people didn't

713
00:31:56,210 --> 00:32:02,540
empty a rubbish we'd soon get into

714
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:04,309
trouble treat everybody the same now

715
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:06,559
that goes away when the senior

716
00:32:04,309 --> 00:32:08,210
leadership person says oh we don't need

717
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:11,418
security you are allowed to take them

718
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:13,309
out back and taser them if you can get

719
00:32:11,419 --> 00:32:15,950
them in a swimming pool and then taser

720
00:32:13,309 --> 00:32:17,210
them you get double points yeah

721
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:18,740
paddling pools are awesome I will

722
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:22,360
occasionally carry a paddling pool with

723
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:26,049
me just for that reason this is a biggie

724
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:26,049
live every moment

725
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:35,030
so the dogs I have as you see I've

726
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:38,720
unfortunately isn't a breed of dog the

727
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:43,250
last seven eight maybe nine years which

728
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:46,280
is gonna suck so I want to make sure I

729
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:51,260
enjoy it but I want to make sure they do

730
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:54,410
too but it's also for us as humans I've

731
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:57,110
been very fortunate in life that I've

732
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:59,300
done a lot of things I've gone to the

733
00:32:57,110 --> 00:33:01,070
stage I've done so much stuff that if I

734
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:04,340
do get run over by the proverbial red

735
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:05,809
bus I won't sit there and go I wish I'd

736
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:08,139
have done something I'd be like hey I

737
00:33:05,809 --> 00:33:12,020
gave life a pretty freakin good shot

738
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:14,900
each one of you introspectively needs to

739
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:17,450
take a look and go hey how much on my

740
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:22,280
wish list have I done and how much am i

741
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:26,059
putting off and what could I do again

742
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:29,960
the selfish moment you deserve it you

743
00:33:26,059 --> 00:33:31,820
earn it freakin take it because

744
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:35,120
something's gonna happen some point in

745
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:38,928
time and if you sit there and go I wish

746
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:42,110
more often than you go I did you need to

747
00:33:38,929 --> 00:33:47,660
look in the mirror a little bit which

748
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:49,490
goes into this one live life Circle City

749
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:52,809
Cohn is a good example of that we get

750
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:56,300
together this is family extended family

751
00:33:52,809 --> 00:33:59,690
dysfunctional family but it's still

752
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:01,870
family and we all need to look after

753
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:03,800
each other

754
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:07,939
welling up of that sorry

755
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:12,889
[Music]

756
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:15,230
one of my favorite ones so this is a

757
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:16,609
rare picture I'm probably one of only a

758
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:17,779
few times that will ever have a picture

759
00:34:16,609 --> 00:34:20,808
on my daughter on there and she's a

760
00:34:17,779 --> 00:34:24,079
little bit blood out but for me this is

761
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:25,490
one of the things I teach her again be

762
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:28,279
true to yourself and to some degree

763
00:34:25,489 --> 00:34:30,439
school and everybody else thinks kids

764
00:34:28,279 --> 00:34:32,349
grow up enough with the amount of peer

765
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:36,710
pressure and social pressure they have

766
00:34:32,349 --> 00:34:39,309
so it's our job to try to teach them to

767
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:41,960
not succumb to that alter the time I

768
00:34:39,309 --> 00:34:59,380
want a hug get your get your a selfie

769
00:34:41,960 --> 00:35:01,970
yeah screw you all for a second okay

770
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:03,589
this is another big one and this is you

771
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:04,549
know I've done doing this now of this it

772
00:35:03,589 --> 00:35:06,740
goes back to what I was talking about

773
00:35:04,549 --> 00:35:08,930
training phone stays in the car

774
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:11,078
end of discussion on Saturdays

775
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:14,000
especially so I'm only here today I

776
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:15,349
leave this evening why because my

777
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,480
daughter's getting picked up at 7:30

778
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:20,599
this evening and it's my week with her I

779
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:23,269
love you guys that I kind of want to

780
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:25,039
spend time with her kind of extended

781
00:35:23,269 --> 00:35:26,450
family blood family all that kind of

782
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:27,680
good stuff eventually she's gonna bugger

783
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:29,899
off and I'll be left with you guys again

784
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:37,098
so you'll be able to deal with me but

785
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:37,670
for now that's what I want okay comfort

786
00:35:37,099 --> 00:35:40,190
food

787
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:42,980
no the snack doggies not comfort food

788
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:46,430
for the big dogs although it is

789
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:48,019
interesting how often the mic I'll see

790
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:49,549
Daisy wandering around ever and again

791
00:35:48,019 --> 00:35:51,410
with this kind of like half a day look

792
00:35:49,549 --> 00:35:53,420
and she's not drunk Jesus got slobber

793
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:55,670
all over here because he'll sit there

794
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:58,519
and they'll lick her a few times and

795
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:59,109
then just kind of gently tries to grew

796
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:01,930
my hair

797
00:35:59,109 --> 00:36:05,410
and like Knorr on our little bit she's

798
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:09,879
just like hell's going on the lights

799
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:15,308
keep going on and off as it says comfort

800
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:17,910
food it's good embrace it that was the

801
00:36:15,309 --> 00:36:20,799
chair before we had to recover it

802
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:22,839
needless to say a different pan this is

803
00:36:20,799 --> 00:36:25,269
a reality check this is a big one again

804
00:36:22,839 --> 00:36:27,308
not having had especially big-ass damn

805
00:36:25,269 --> 00:36:29,769
dogs I kind of didn't know what I was

806
00:36:27,309 --> 00:36:31,539
letting myself in for it then went

807
00:36:29,769 --> 00:36:33,700
through the first winter and the first

808
00:36:31,539 --> 00:36:35,920
time the muddy paws went from the door

809
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:41,109
all the way in down the white carpet

810
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:45,249
onto the bed I'm like oh by the tenth

811
00:36:41,109 --> 00:36:46,869
time it happened I'm like fuck it I went

812
00:36:45,249 --> 00:36:48,578
from having one of those stupid little

813
00:36:46,869 --> 00:36:51,099
Roomba stand there having three rhombus

814
00:36:48,579 --> 00:36:53,829
and the cleaner that comes in twice a

815
00:36:51,099 --> 00:36:56,619
week and somebody that picks up the poo

816
00:36:53,829 --> 00:37:00,369
three times a week you just got to pick

817
00:36:56,619 --> 00:37:02,589
the battles and again as people in our

818
00:37:00,369 --> 00:37:04,809
industry you know there's books out

819
00:37:02,589 --> 00:37:07,328
there don't sweat the small stuff and a

820
00:37:04,809 --> 00:37:11,499
reality checks and everything else but

821
00:37:07,329 --> 00:37:15,130
this is so true and especially in the

822
00:37:11,499 --> 00:37:17,288
work that we do you know there are so

823
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:19,089
many things that we have to deal with

824
00:37:17,289 --> 00:37:21,579
that we have to try to focus on that we

825
00:37:19,089 --> 00:37:24,940
have to try to prioritize that we have

826
00:37:21,579 --> 00:37:29,410
to should do need to care about you

827
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:31,599
can't fix everything pick the battles

828
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:33,220
pick the ones that are low-hanging fruit

829
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:35,380
get a couple of those out of the way

830
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:37,618
pick the ones that you care about the

831
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:40,329
matter the most to protect the humans

832
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:41,829
but you know there is a book out there

833
00:37:40,329 --> 00:37:48,609
don't sweat the small stuff and I hate

834
00:37:41,829 --> 00:37:52,119
to say it it's got some use this this is

835
00:37:48,609 --> 00:37:53,799
huge how many of you have got pets this

836
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:57,220
is huge for me it's it's really

837
00:37:53,799 --> 00:37:59,140
interesting Daisy did not come from a

838
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:02,618
good a good home that's Trixie by the

839
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:04,180
way actually pinning me down but AC

840
00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:06,249
didn't come from a good home we're not

841
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:08,049
sure where she came from but she didn't

842
00:38:06,249 --> 00:38:09,430
have a good first four years of life and

843
00:38:08,049 --> 00:38:12,310
it's taken her literally

844
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:14,310
to figure us out but now she's like yeah

845
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:17,230
you're my humans I've got you covered

846
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:19,750
this is my chair that is my stove a them

847
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:20,260
I'll get three square meals a day I got

848
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:23,560
you covered

849
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:25,690
and it's amazing how much with mirrored

850
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:28,210
with adults with moods with attitudes

851
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:33,070
and everything else so again as humans

852
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:34,930
look to see how we project out what

853
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:37,240
emotions that we project him what are we

854
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:39,129
carrying with us what can we do

855
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:41,379
differently and how can we do it

856
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:51,010
differently there's some interesting

857
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:53,920
things to consider it scared the crap

858
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:56,380
out of me getting the dog I didn't know

859
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:59,050
what I was leaning in for I wasn't sure

860
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:02,230
about it I'm like I'm not that if we can

861
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:05,620
do this the hassles the problems now

862
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:08,950
screw that all couldn't live with Adam

863
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:10,450
could not live without them aside from

864
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:12,939
the hugs and the slobber and the

865
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:14,830
craziness just the fact that I know when

866
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:17,440
I'm away especially when the rugrats

867
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:19,029
there there's full protection all of

868
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:22,420
those things and the fact that they're

869
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:27,370
just there the house is no longer just a

870
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:33,010
house it's a home big difference how

871
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:36,279
appreciate life the moment again that

872
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:38,800
selfish thing we spend so much time

873
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:41,140
rushing around I'm one of the first

874
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,030
offenders let's be honest but

875
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:47,529
occasionally we just all need to take

876
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:49,090
that step back breathe smell whatever

877
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:52,900
the smell you're in in despair if you're

878
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:55,780
in a city you're not smelling but in

879
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:57,370
this case smell the fire hydrant or in

880
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:59,080
Daisy's case she's like hey patio

881
00:39:57,370 --> 00:40:04,420
furniture thank you for buying that for

882
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:07,250
me donc so wrapping it all up

883
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:10,640
this is very wordy and it is very

884
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:13,940
extensive but it is also I put it up on

885
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:16,700
LinkedIn this is hatched we posted by

886
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:18,620
the door of the house and it's kind of

887
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:21,529
like the house rules as written by the

888
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:24,100
dog that's Milo giving me a fist bump

889
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:26,750
before we went on the 10k ruck march

890
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:28,190
he's like you're the silly sod carrying

891
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:31,460
the backpack don't even think about

892
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:34,540
giving me one of us we end up carrying

893
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:37,550
food so it was a food charity March and

894
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:40,130
for each person taking part we took 25

895
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:41,720
pounds of food and then for every person

896
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:43,610
that we wanted to not necessarily

897
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:45,709
remember but actually have and I have

898
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:46,250
tags for two of my colleagues on my pack

899
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:48,380
with me

900
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:51,860
so there are a number of us that we did

901
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:54,340
the 10k with 75 pound plus packs so he

902
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:58,130
came with us and he hung out it was good

903
00:40:54,340 --> 00:41:02,360
so that's our history for those of you

904
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:04,670
that remember our history this was 10 15

905
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:07,310
plus years ago the evolve or Die stuff

906
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:10,580
came out from packet storm don't feel

907
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:15,410
like we've done much evolution yet but

908
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:19,400
this needs to be our future it's gonna

909
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:22,670
take all of us it really really is more

910
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:27,440
than we have here more than just IT more

911
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:31,340
than just information security and I

912
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:35,150
mean all of us a respective background

913
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:36,880
race creed color religion limbs I don't

914
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:40,510
give a shit

915
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:43,490
use the dog's analogy look past that

916
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:46,460
look into the heart of the person the

917
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:49,330
soul of the person and see if they can

918
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:52,100
help and how can you work with them and

919
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:55,009
it's not everybody's yeah this isn't

920
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:58,790
somebody's blame game when we talk about

921
00:41:55,010 --> 00:42:00,260
security it has to be everybody now we

922
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:02,180
have to figure out how to communicate

923
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:04,490
with the c-suite with leadership and

924
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:05,930
we're bored we have to be the ones that

925
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:08,990
have to figure out how we talk to

926
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:10,460
everybody end users believe me I am one

927
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:12,830
of the first people in the queue to

928
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:15,890
taser the occasional end user just for

929
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:17,259
sheer necessities every now and again

930
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:19,930
but for the most

931
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:21,280
PAH we have really got to figure out how

932
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:23,890
the health of work with an effectively

933
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:26,190
we really do because the alternatives

934
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:31,089
aren't that good to be perfectly honest

935
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:33,760
why well we think it's bad it's gonna

936
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:37,420
get worked let's be honest more apps

937
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:42,880
more connected people many more

938
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:47,020
connected devices and unfortunately the

939
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:49,720
braking side it way too easy way too

940
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:52,660
easy they're a challenge for everybody

941
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:55,390
here when you stand up at a conference

942
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:57,549
or when you go to put a talk out to a

943
00:42:55,390 --> 00:43:01,810
conference you're a guy I found a floor

944
00:42:57,550 --> 00:43:04,930
kick ass Bert I'm happy me a damn

945
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:07,180
solution give me a solution that will

946
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:08,830
work in the business give me a solution

947
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:10,779
that will work in industry in

948
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:14,740
manufacturing give me a solution that

949
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:16,780
people will be able to deal with don't

950
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:22,359
show me how to break shit show me how to

951
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:25,030
fix it so I like this one it's my new

952
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:26,500
favorite one and I like you for a bunch

953
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:27,850
of reasons for all the obvious once

954
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:32,530
we're in different ships were on the

955
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:34,240
same boat it says it all and then this

956
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:39,580
just kind of simplifies it a little bit

957
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:42,700
more as individuals in this industry and

958
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:45,970
in what with seeing you know the chances

959
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:48,850
of us succeeding not good we band

960
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:52,149
together not just IT and not just

961
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:54,819
security we work with everybody around

962
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:56,290
us when you put a solution out it needs

963
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:59,500
to not just work for the geek in the

964
00:43:56,290 --> 00:44:01,450
room my mother who's in the UK who's in

965
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:03,910
her late 70s needs to be able to figure

966
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:05,710
that shit out too and by the way you

967
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:11,920
better be able to explain it to the damn

968
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:14,620
wolf ma that is a proper solution when

969
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:18,099
we can do that we stand a better chance

970
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:22,690
of succeeding so

971
00:44:18,099 --> 00:44:24,940
as always final slide along with a large

972
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:26,410
hundred and forty five pound wet nose in

973
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:28,390
the corner for a change rather than the

974
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:30,089
squirrel there is an absence of squirrel

975
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:33,098
these slides you might have noticed

976
00:44:30,089 --> 00:44:37,119
maybe there were a lot of dogs questions

977
00:44:33,099 --> 00:44:38,589
a little bit of extra time any questions

978
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:40,749
what does it really want to get the hell

979
00:44:38,589 --> 00:44:47,859
out of here and get alcohol alcohol

980
00:44:40,749 --> 00:44:49,479
alright yeah first half it's okay I hope

981
00:44:47,859 --> 00:44:51,400
I missed the first in Thai conference

982
00:44:49,479 --> 00:44:56,439
poor Jeff had to fill in for me

983
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:57,999
well thanks United so what are you

984
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:01,119
you've done a lot of analogies between

985
00:44:57,999 --> 00:45:04,149
having a dog and having a fulfilling

986
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:06,819
life what are the one or two things you

987
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:08,829
would have done differently or the road

988
00:45:06,819 --> 00:45:13,808
that you should have taken and you

989
00:45:08,829 --> 00:45:15,150
didn't I probably would have been more

990
00:45:13,809 --> 00:45:18,779
true to myself

991
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:20,890
so a perfect example I mean that the owl

992
00:45:18,779 --> 00:45:23,910
debacle and the mess that happened with

993
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:27,129
warm water labs I was including myself I

994
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:28,899
had a really good consulting company and

995
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:30,519
we were building a kick-ass kind of

996
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:36,489
product with her tell him this was back

997
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:38,529
in got lose it again here we go and we

998
00:45:36,489 --> 00:45:39,940
went after investment money and we took

999
00:45:38,529 --> 00:45:42,430
that investment money because we wanted

1000
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:44,680
to grow and be bigger and stronger and

1001
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:46,149
all that shit I didn't stay true to

1002
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:47,859
myself I didn't say hey look you know

1003
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:50,229
we're doing good there's a good team as

1004
00:45:47,859 --> 00:45:52,299
a good family there were 25 30 of us at

1005
00:45:50,229 --> 00:45:54,339
the time and we wanted to go further and

1006
00:45:52,299 --> 00:45:56,259
I did the wrong thing I also didn't

1007
00:45:54,339 --> 00:45:59,859
follow my gut instinct we took money

1008
00:45:56,259 --> 00:46:04,869
from investors who were risk-averse this

1009
00:45:59,859 --> 00:46:07,900
is not a risk-averse world and so we got

1010
00:46:04,869 --> 00:46:09,400
sideways really really quickly so I

1011
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:11,319
would have definitely done that a lot

1012
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:13,930
differently I learned a lot from that

1013
00:46:11,319 --> 00:46:18,190
and unfortunately it cost me a lot in a

1014
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:20,078
number of different ways something I'm

1015
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:21,430
wrestling the moment which the dogs

1016
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:24,190
would be good with but I'm wrestling

1017
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:25,569
with is saying no I'm not good at saying

1018
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:26,950
no I was actually gonna put a LinkedIn

1019
00:46:25,569 --> 00:46:28,029
post out about it I'm still trying to

1020
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,799
figure out what the hell I want to say

1021
00:46:28,029 --> 00:46:33,180
I'm terrible at it

1022
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,180
want to please everybody

1023
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:38,860
[Music]

1024
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:43,950
there we go there we go thank you and I

1025
00:46:42,119 --> 00:46:46,619
try to get so much done but the problem

1026
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:48,540
this so much gets asked of me and I try

1027
00:46:46,619 --> 00:46:52,380
to say yes to everything which means I'm

1028
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:54,000
failing at a lot so I apologize in

1029
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:55,470
advance and reread of this ask for help

1030
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,839
but I'm gonna start saying no a little

1031
00:46:55,470 --> 00:47:00,240
bit more often because it's the only way

1032
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:01,770
I can succeed at the things I want to

1033
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:08,759
try to get done if that makes any sense

1034
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:15,380
so two key points you go forever they

1035
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:20,040
feel like I'm baring my soul here yeah

1036
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:22,440
so what is going to be your kickoff

1037
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:24,240
come kickoff presentation at higher

1038
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:29,369
ground in Las Vegas

1039
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:31,618
I know sudden clue so what are the one

1040
00:47:29,369 --> 00:47:34,829
or two career tips you can give

1041
00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:36,990
everybody ah probably back to what the

1042
00:47:34,829 --> 00:47:39,569
wolf mutt was doing get out yeah it's

1043
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:41,729
it's that whole idea for me puffin

1044
00:47:39,569 --> 00:47:45,000
example when the dog first saw snow what

1045
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:48,450
are the doctor raid into it headfirst

1046
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,609
literally headfirst mouth open headfirst

1047
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:56,700
it was like watching a snow pile with

1048
00:47:50,609 --> 00:47:58,560
drool just got out there and said I'm

1049
00:47:56,700 --> 00:48:00,359
just gonna give it a try I want to see

1050
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:02,430

1051
00:48:00,359 --> 00:48:08,040
it I want to see what I can do I don't

1052
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:09,180
care especially I mean we get asked a

1053
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,680
lot of us probably get asked all the

1054
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:12,930
time hey how do I get into this industry

1055

1056
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:18,089
how to fix it and then write about it

1057
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:19,799
