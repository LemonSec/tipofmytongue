ceremonies and we normally do but for

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,130
good reasons so you'll see all right so

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:18,359
Circle City con six super serious space

7
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:20,250

and thirty plus registrations this year

9
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,000
that is a record for us and I'm pretty

10
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,009
sure we had more people because I'm

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,480
pretty sure some staffers didn't do it

12
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:32,790
like they were told and didn't register

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:36,480

00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,610
you who are like repeat offenders here

34
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:50,679
is Circle City con there's been a bit of

35
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:55,149
a tradition developing over the past few

36
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:57,819
years we have a a subculture of narrow

37
00:01:55,149 --> 00:02:01,920
duels and ruffians amongst us folks who

38
00:01:57,819 --> 00:02:04,959
think that it's fun to go and in

39
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:09,878
exercise our skills against other events

40
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:12,819
in the area so this started like what

41
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:14,560
year three I think there was a young

42
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:16,929
Republicans convention here in this

43
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:21,760
hotel some of you may remove you may

44
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:23,230
recall we also yeah people breaking into

45
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,879
doctor bear's room in the middle of the

46
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:29,109

47
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:31,690

48
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:32,890

49
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:34,569

50
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:38,379
around with the coffee con badges coffee

51
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:40,089

we have a couple of them here actually

53
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:46,319
in the audience so we successfully

54
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:48,120
routed the coffee fest

55
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,790
we have persistent that we had

56
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,819
persistent access throughout we got some

57
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:56,010
coffee if I'm not mistaken if I we had

58
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:59,339
people sitting in on judging taste tests

59
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:01,409
we had I believe I heard some mention

60
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,700
there was a goal did we accomplish the

61
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:04,620
sitting in on the latte making

62
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:08,040
competition okay so we come to we

63
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:10,409
competed in their events in addition the

64
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,900
so I believe breakfast pants I think you

65
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:18,899
have some meetings right Oh meeting set

66
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:21,090

67
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,220
that's where hackers it's what we do

68
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:26,099
nobody was hurt no ant no animals were

69
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:28,169
killed in the making of this video but

70
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:30,090
hopefully you know keep your eyes posted

71
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:31,650
especially to Twitter because I believe

72
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,180
these guys are gonna be doing a lot more

73
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,799
work on what we've done there's supposed

74
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,019
to be a write-up I believe we've got

75
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:41,340
some podcast material that's developing

76
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:44,010
from this and there is and and you

77
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:48,389
should all keep an eye out for changes

78
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:50,698
to afflict being calm because we're

79
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:52,290
gonna be hopefully profiling some of

80
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:54,359
this stuff so thanks to everybody for

81
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:59,040

no one touched it this year no one

88
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:18,889

we're transitioning we basically both

298
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:11,920
made the decision to see what our

299
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:13,360
replacements can do our original plan

300
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,540
was to make this say about a two or

301
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:19,149
three year transition and about April we

302

got on the phone together and said do we

303
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:23,410
need to do this over three years and the

304
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:26,110
answer was no because they really kicked

305
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:27,910

detected and the Kay knock this year so

362
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:41,090
that's that's quite a few here it looks

363

like we have yeah issue and one okay

364
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:45,520
that's fun so here's the more

365
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:48,740
interesting one which is bandwidth usage

366
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:50,220
you people go to bed what's wrong with

367
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:52,840
you

368
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:54,610
that's I mean obviously you can tell I

369
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,379
mean either that or the network drop but

370
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:58,240
I'm dead did not happen that often but

371
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:01,200
look at that look at was it at one point

372
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,250
we were peeking up at 160 mega

373
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:07,240

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:17,950
bandwidth out the internet and then

over there is no way over there are they

380
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:29,200
really that far away and I know it's not

381
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:31,120
a well it was at one point but I know

382
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,010
it's not a country but yeah we got there

383
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,879
we got some fairly good Russia no

384
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:41,620
collusion no collusion just like Canada

385
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:45,070
not a real country so yeah I do want to

386

414
00:21:54,700 --> 00:22:00,040
lot of awesome participation this year

415
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:01,990
in all the contests and entertainment so

416
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:04,030
thank you first and foremost all the

417
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:06,610
participants for the enthusiastic at

418
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:08,290
times participation in my contests and

419
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:10,959
for some of the less enthusiastic

420
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:13,300
participation as well the first off I

421
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,070
would like to introduce somebody's very

422
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:18,389
dear to me she is going to talk through

423
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:18,389
the escape route of Jie

424
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:26,080
all righty I wanted to show a picture of

425
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:30,520
the thought process first so just the

426
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:33,669
overall gist was being in a in space

427
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:37,800
obviously the spaceship Lin tile was

428
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:40,780
attacked by the evil shmoo everyone died

429
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:42,340
everyone is dead and before dying the

430
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:44,950
captain initiated the 50 minute

431
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:47,080
self-destruct sequence and you as the

432
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:50,110
away team are there to rescue technology

433
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:52,149
that cannot fall into the shmoo however

434
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:55,770
it takes 51 minutes to download the data

435
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:58,960
so you have to disable the self-destruct

436
00:22:55,770 --> 00:23:01,210
the bridge has been ruined you are in

437
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,450
the captain's ready room and you have to

438
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:05,980
use the console there however it was not

439
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:08,290
assembled yet that was gonna happen next

440
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:10,510
Tuesday so you need to find the

441
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:13,629
components build the computer log in

442
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:15,280
find the self-destruct and terminate so

443
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:17,110
there's a bunch of puzzles in there

444
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:21,280
obviously very space themed you can see

445
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:22,990
the thought process here I'm a nerd and

446
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,450
this is what I did four months before

447
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:31,930
heading here so this is what my brain

448
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:35,440
looks like it's it's cool it's fine yeah

449
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:35,950
I think the next perfect so here are

450
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,630
some results

451
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:39,370
everybody did awesome I mean there is

452
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:41,410
definitely I think these are the five

453
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:43,389
teams that made it out I also want to

454
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:46,270
honorable mention just right off the bat

455
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:48,160
Tyros because they did at the fastest it

456
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:48,850
was a little over 30 minutes to get out

457
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,250
of it so

458
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:53,439
tyro is definitely when the awesome

459
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:56,360

460
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:59,240

545
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:43,240
first we had 200 registered users which

546
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:47,049
is a high mark for circle city con a

547
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:49,720
hundred and nine of them teams 74 of the

548
00:28:47,049 --> 00:28:54,280
hundred and nine teams with salt so as a

549
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:57,549
comparison to last year it was about 50%

550
00:28:54,280 --> 00:29:00,790
of the users actually solved at least

551
00:28:57,549 --> 00:29:04,629
one flag but that's up from the year

552
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:07,120
before which 33% you know signed up and

553
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:08,380

607
00:31:54,289 --> 00:31:58,190
description with every single challenge

608
00:31:55,999 --> 00:32:01,999

609
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:03,499
negative one and it's specifically the

610
00:32:01,999 --> 00:32:06,409

seed since this is one of grapes guys

714
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:43,730
yeah I'm probably gonna jump in here

715
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:45,589
some of this I don't I try not to get

716
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:46,520
sappy but sometimes it happens so

717
00:37:45,589 --> 00:37:50,150
forgive me

718
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:51,890
Mike came I think with Amanda Burrell in

719
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:54,440
the first year right you guys kind of

720
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:55,400
came is she still here by chance all

721
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,710
right so

722
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:59,120
he came and was just like yeah sure I'll

723
00:37:57,710 --> 00:38:00,800
go I got nothing to do for the weekend

724
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:02,750
so they rode over from Ohio and hung out

725
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,900
and they made the mistake of getting

726
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:07,460
here early and for those of you who were

727
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:10,250
around for the first year it was

728
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:12,290
absolute madness it was nonsense and I

729
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:14,330
found this guy he was like hey I can

730
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:16,910
help you know you need some help you

731
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:21,920
screwed up buddy so sure I'll put you to

732
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:23,960
work so we had him I think he liked the

733
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,480
mom I think Mike probably ran like

734
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:29,750
probably a mile and a half of cat5 cable

735
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:32,600
that weekend handled everything with

736
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:34,430
like setting up the a/v stuff and like

737
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:36,830
as we sat back and really did this this

738
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:38,450
dude just came out of nowhere and just

739
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:41,420
out of the kindness of his heart decided

740
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:42,770
to help us but he did so well he took

741
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:45,320
care of working with the staff

742
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:47,930
coordinating some volunteers and you

743
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:51,350
know it's eventually led to him being

744
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:55,359

staffers that are now like starting to

869
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:23,830
get into their next decade started out

870
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:26,529
really as young kids and we've watched

871
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:28,390
them grow up in this industry and one of

872
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:31,120
the things that grape and I are big into

873
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:34,089
is seeing that next generation grow of

874
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:36,220
seeing the mentorship and watching a lot

875
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:38,670
of these people grow up into what they

876
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:41,439

926
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:49,330
Phoenix like honestly my job this year

927
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:51,160
it was so easy and I had trust I knew I

928
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:53,619
could walk away and do things because

929
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:56,560
Phoenix was there she's an absolutely

930
00:47:53,619 --> 00:48:01,780
wonderful person and she made this con

931
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:04,000
happen and I say I'm gonna be a little

932
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:07,630
sappy from time to time a couple years

933
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:10,480
ago a couple years ago I got kind of

934
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:13,030
roped into having to manage all of the

935
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:16,680
volunteers on top of the other

936
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:19,840
organizational duties and it became

937
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:22,299
increased it became increasingly

938
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:24,190
difficult to herd these cats I don't

939
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:25,869
know if you've all ever been to a hacker

940
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:27,850
con before but we're not exactly the

941
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:31,030
most reliable people and we tend to

942
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:34,839
drink a little bit and it was difficult

943
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:36,940
to kind of deal with that with all the

944
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:38,920
other fires and bringing Phoenix on has

945
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:40,930
been a godsend you you have really been

946
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:42,040
very helpful to us so we thank you for

947
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:43,660
your time we thank you for the

948
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:47,279
investment and we appreciate you very

949
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:47,279
much thank you thank you Phoenix

950
00:48:50,479 --> 00:48:55,799
all right this next person I love and

951
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:57,749
loathed at the same time I love him

952
00:48:55,799 --> 00:48:59,339
because he's an awesome guy if you've

953
00:48:57,749 --> 00:49:01,939
ever done his crypto challenges of the

954
00:48:59,339 --> 00:49:05,819
CTF you hate him with a passion

955
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:08,749
so Mike Connor where are you buddy there

956
00:49:05,819 --> 00:49:08,749
we go Mike Connor

957
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:19,170
Mike does some sadistically messed up

958
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:22,589
crypto challenges that my favorite one

959
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:23,849
was besides Detroit one year and we're

960
00:49:22,589 --> 00:49:25,589
sitting there playing and that cracked

961
00:49:23,849 --> 00:49:27,329
the challenge I wanted to find that it

962
00:49:25,589 --> 00:49:28,980
was completely false flag he had put

963
00:49:27,329 --> 00:49:31,200
there that said oh hey guess what this

964
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:33,510
isn't the actual flag try again I

965
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:35,250
believe I yell at the word

966
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:38,000
in the middle of the cook of the CTF

967
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:41,310
just randomly when that happened it's

968
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:44,250
yeah so you're a sadistic bastard but we

969
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:46,619
love you to death yeah I don't very

970
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:48,950
often find somebody who's trolling at

971
00:49:46,619 --> 00:49:54,320
least with CTF challenges rivals my own

972
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:57,328
and having Mike on my team is just

973
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:59,160
unbelievable boon because he is mr.

974
00:49:57,329 --> 00:50:01,710
reliable on getting things done on time

975
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:04,440
and as was said about others in this

976
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:06,570
group people that are reliable are

977
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:08,760
outliers and it's amazing to have them

978
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:10,790
on board so Mike thank you so much my

979
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,790

1037
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:08,440

real asshole I keep reading online I

1041
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:29,710

1042
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:32,319

1046
00:53:37,330 --> 00:53:42,360
our trainers started spouting some stuff

1047
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:44,590
out on Twitter and it was blew up as

1048
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:46,180
saying stuff on Twitter does because

1049
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:48,280
people can't seem to get the concept of

1050
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:53,560
hey shut the hell up on Twitter and stop

1051
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:57,490
talking and I didn't know what to do so

1052
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:59,350
I got this person's phone number and

1053
00:53:57,490 --> 00:54:01,419
called him up and he sat with me and

1054
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:03,060
talked to me about 30 45 minutes and we

1055
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:05,520
went over a thing because he has press

1056
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:08,590
background and figured out what to do

1057
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:10,780

1062
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:20,920

00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:24,580
without him

1141
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:29,140
who likes the training who likes to

1142
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:31,420
multiple classes so year two on that or

1143
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:33,129
right before you are after year one I'm

1144
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:34,810
at Def Con and I'm talking to him and

1145
00:58:33,130 --> 00:58:37,120
I'm like hey what you think of Colin all

1146
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:38,380
it was great he's like the training was

1147
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:40,180
awesome you know what you only had five

1148
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:41,740
classes what you should do is just load

1149
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:44,230
this up with training I look on the

1150
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:47,740
go that is the smartest idea I have ever

1151
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:50,890
heard and so all the training classes we

1152
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:53,939
have in doing that was a direct idea of

1153
00:58:50,890 --> 00:58:56,650
rancis that's why we do what we do there

1154
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:59,170
he also makes that it made a hell of a

1155
00:58:56,650 --> 00:59:01,330
White Russian Lebowski level White

1156
00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:02,560
Russian those you ever had one they

1157
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:05,680
knocked you on your ass they were damn

1158
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:07,810
good my officer favorite story rants

1159
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:10,210
story finally is actually shmoocon story

1160
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:11,520
but he and I would sit outside the hotel

1161
00:59:10,210 --> 00:59:12,870
and

1162
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:15,210
revolving door there's a stop button

1163
00:59:12,870 --> 00:59:16,890
those who within the shoe condo and he

1164
00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:20,370
would sit for hours smoking cigarettes

1165
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:22,799
and drinking and just as people get

1166
00:59:20,370 --> 00:59:27,540
stuck in the thing it made us made us

1167
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:29,790
laugh it was fun so so I have no doubt

1168
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:32,580
in my mind that if rants were still with

1169
00:59:29,790 --> 00:59:33,779
us he would have been here every year

1170
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:38,100
and he would be getting one of these

1171
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:40,590
himself unfortunately as most as well

1172
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:42,630
you know he's not so this is for rants

1173
00:59:40,590 --> 00:59:45,960
what I talking over with some people and

1174
00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:47,760
this was a grapes idea what we're going

1175
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:50,070
to do is we are going to take this I

1176
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:52,020
have one of the cancer rants coins

1177
00:59:50,070 --> 00:59:53,370
at home and we're going to find a rubber

1178
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:54,509
chicken so some of those rubber one of

1179
00:59:53,370 --> 00:59:56,400
the little rubber chickens that we can

1180
00:59:54,510 --> 00:59:57,990
have perfect Jenny's got them and we're

1181
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:01,080
gonna do a shadow box with these in

1182
00:59:57,990 --> 01:00:03,149
there and hopefully a picture maybe is

1183
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:04,650
any picture I think and we're going to

1184
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:06,600
bring it and we're going to have it at

1185
01:00:04,650 --> 01:00:08,490
every party it's going to be it's going

1186
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:10,049
to be our thing and I think that might

1187
01:00:08,490 --> 01:00:11,819
be a tradition for staffers going

1188
01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:13,710
forward that if we lose a staff where

1189
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:15,060
we're going to do a very similar thing

1190
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:17,180
and we'll have our you know have our

1191
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:19,140
kind of on our wall for those people so

1192
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:21,830
let's give a big round of applause

1193
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:21,830
please to Rance

1194
01:00:31,470 --> 01:00:35,649
all right so we have some retirements

1195
01:00:34,090 --> 01:00:36,970
this year from their positions now

1196
01:00:35,650 --> 01:00:39,610
they're still involved in the conference

1197
01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:42,100
but they're retiring from there from

1198
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:44,170
there from their current positions and

1199
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:46,060
moving into different more advisory type

1200
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:46,480
roles or running events or things like

1201
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:54,360
that

1202
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:54,360
so first person honorable discharge

1203
01:00:55,290 --> 01:01:01,960
so lickety joined us here to rehear one

1204
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:05,980
your one here your two and he quickly

1205
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:07,570
ran he quickly became a one of the most

1206
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:09,880
important persons in the con because

1207
01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:12,820
without him our internet does not run or

1208
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:14,650
did not run he has spent probably more

1209
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:15,970
sleepless hours at this conference the

1210
01:01:14,650 --> 01:01:20,680
only people that come closer the

1211
01:01:15,970 --> 01:01:23,410
overnight safety ops literally have seen

1212
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:24,940
him work at 24 hours shift before and he

1213
01:01:23,410 --> 01:01:26,410
gets all real tired and everything and a

1214
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:32,530
little cranky but we love him to death

1215
01:01:26,410 --> 01:01:34,450
for that so he decided he came to me at

1216
01:01:32,530 --> 01:01:39,400
the start of this year and said hey

1217
01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:40,689
guess what I'm ready to hand off control

1218
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:42,970
of this I'm ready to give this to Frank

1219
01:01:40,690 --> 01:01:44,680
and then we said cool a couple of us

1220
01:01:42,970 --> 01:01:48,189
thinking the same thing so we we

1221
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:49,359
appreciate that so when all this came

1222
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:51,220
about I wanted to find a good way to

1223
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:54,850
honor those people that are retiring

1224
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:57,970
this year and kind of give them a

1225
01:01:54,850 --> 01:02:00,580
special something to kind of to show

1226
01:01:57,970 --> 01:02:02,819
what they mean to us so a Christian

1227
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:02,819
coming

1228
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:17,800
so first we have your five-year coin and

1229
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:19,649
second we have your black bench so not

1230
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:22,300
that you really need one to get in but

1231
01:02:19,650 --> 01:02:24,160
again I want to show the thank you that

1232
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:26,260
we have for you and all the hard work

1233
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:28,720
that you've done very much appreciate it

1234
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:34,510
and you know just thank you for being a

1235
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:38,350
part of the kind that's just a couple

1236
01:02:34,510 --> 01:02:40,270
words when I started out doing this saw

1237
01:02:38,350 --> 01:02:42,310
the pathetic state of their network in

1238
01:02:40,270 --> 01:02:46,930
year one and thought I volunteered help

1239
01:02:42,310 --> 01:02:48,160
so so over the years we've had

1240
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:49,720
challenges and I think we've done a

1241
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:51,910
fantastic job in overcoming a lot of

1242
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:54,490
those challenges and now we have a whole

1243
01:02:51,910 --> 01:02:55,990
new set and we have some new leadership

1244
01:02:54,490 --> 01:02:58,390
on the NACA I think they're gonna do a

1245
01:02:55,990 --> 01:02:59,830
fantastic job and if you've never had to

1246
01:02:58,390 --> 01:03:01,620
talk to any of us I think we're doing a

1247
01:02:59,830 --> 01:03:04,690
good job

1248
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:04,690
[Applause]

1249
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:13,550
we're also not gonna rely on a certain

1250
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:13,550
person's boxes for networking anymore I

1251
01:03:14,510 --> 01:03:22,860
think we're still waiting right all

1252
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:28,830
right our next person joined us here too

1253
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:32,130
she has been a they I'm apologized

1254
01:03:28,830 --> 01:03:35,400
they have been a phenomenal phenomenal

1255
01:03:32,130 --> 01:03:37,770
asset to this conference they were

1256
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:41,100
brought in because basically none of us

1257
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:44,520
knew how to run a friggin conference and

1258
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:48,029
we needed help we had some problems year

1259
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:50,160
two especially on the safety team and we

1260
01:03:48,030 --> 01:03:51,600
needed someone that can come in and just

1261
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:54,330
really kind of hit the floor running

1262
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:57,000
some with experience so called it

1263
01:03:54,330 --> 01:04:00,500
banshee said hey can you come help us

1264
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,500
and she's like yes I can

1265
01:04:03,650 --> 01:04:09,390

1266
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:10,830
this weekend and so it's I'm still

1267
01:04:09,390 --> 01:04:13,799
getting used to it so I'm going to

1268
01:04:10,830 --> 01:04:15,090
apologize just in advance so they've

1269
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:18,360
been a wonderful asset to the

1270
01:04:15,090 --> 01:04:21,090
organization they have built our safety

1271
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:24,510
ops team into a phenomenal phenomenal

1272
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:27,390
team they have kept us in check when

1273
01:04:24,510 --> 01:04:29,670
we've done stupid they have said

1274
01:04:27,390 --> 01:04:31,740
things like hey you know how you're all

1275
01:04:29,670 --> 01:04:33,960
drinking and wearing shirts while you're

1276
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:35,729
in concerts were you drinking maybe we

1277
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:37,320
don't want to do that oh yeah that's a

1278
01:04:35,730 --> 01:04:41,790
good idea why didn't we think of that

1279
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:43,350
okay cool let's do that so sadly that's

1280
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:47,490
actually the truth but I didn't want to

1281
01:04:43,350 --> 01:04:48,930
go there so Banshee is going to be

1282

if they weren't as trainable as they

1300
01:05:36,170 --> 01:05:48,290
were it wouldn't be as easy for me to

1301
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:50,450
step away all right the next one I'm

1302
01:05:48,290 --> 01:05:58,549
gonna say one thing first and then you

1303
01:05:50,450 --> 01:05:59,919
will let you up so he probably hates me

1304
01:05:58,549 --> 01:06:03,170
now

1305
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:05,140
but about six years ago when I started

1306
01:06:03,170 --> 01:06:07,549
taking over this conference I basically

1307
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:10,700
was struggling and trying to figure out

1308
01:06:07,549 --> 01:06:13,130
how the hell am I gonna do this thing so

1309
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:15,649
what I did is those you know me is I you

1310
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:18,020
know can be a pretty smooth talker at

1311
01:06:15,650 --> 01:06:21,410
times and you know I have a way of being

1312
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:24,230
able to turn those into yeses and so I

1313
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:25,670
called up my friend grape and said hey

1314
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:28,280
buddy I really need some help

1315
01:06:25,670 --> 01:06:30,349
and he's like hell no go yourself

1316
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:30,710
and I'm like but but I really need some

1317
01:06:30,349 --> 01:06:32,960
help

1318
01:06:30,710 --> 01:06:35,690
and he says it again and I said dude

1319
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:40,819
really I'm struggling I need some help

1320
01:06:35,690 --> 01:06:43,339
and he's like okay I'm there so he shows

1321
01:06:40,819 --> 01:06:45,109
up runs our security team yeah he was a

1322
01:06:43,339 --> 01:06:49,369
sucker notice it's like the mob you're

1323
01:06:45,109 --> 01:06:53,058
not out so he showed up when I ran our

1324
01:06:49,369 --> 01:06:54,710
security team we ran some challenges he

1325
01:06:53,059 --> 01:06:56,750
was the one that got in there and really

1326
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:58,910
helped knock heads and keep things keep

1327
01:06:56,750 --> 01:07:00,740
the trains running on time when we

1328
01:06:58,910 --> 01:07:02,690
decided to go to the new format that we

1329
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:03,919
went to in year two again one of the

1330
01:07:02,690 --> 01:07:06,230
first people that was named for the

1331
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:08,059
board i've been our chief operations

1332
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:12,079
officer in our vice chairman of the

1333
01:07:08,059 --> 01:07:17,480
board for the last six years five years

1334
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:20,000
letters so this man has been one of my

1335
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:22,390
closest friends in InfoSec he's been

1336
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:25,579
just a

1337
01:07:22,390 --> 01:07:28,940
you know fantastic feels really weird

1338
01:07:25,579 --> 01:07:33,710
yeah I know fantastic friends someone I

1339
01:07:28,940 --> 01:07:34,099
care abouts loved to death and you

1340
01:07:33,710 --> 01:07:36,559
Johnny

1341
01:07:34,099 --> 01:07:39,400
is this a continuation of the picture

1342
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:39,400
from last year

1343
01:07:40,119 --> 01:07:45,529
so without further ado I know I'm

1344
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:48,170
talking but this con would not be what

1345
01:07:45,529 --> 01:07:49,339
it is without mr. Grape Ape I'm gonna

1346
01:07:48,170 --> 01:07:52,250
handed over to list of who wants to save

1347
01:07:49,339 --> 01:07:54,170
some stuff she's been his prodigy in the

1348
01:07:52,250 --> 01:07:56,660
conference and she's going to take it

1349
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:58,789
home oh yeah and I'm gonna get you right

1350
01:07:56,660 --> 01:08:00,379
in the fields here so sorry let me just

1351
01:07:58,789 --> 01:08:01,579
say a few careful cuz my eyes are

1352
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:03,559
already still a little wet from the

1353
01:08:01,579 --> 01:08:04,910
whole Rance thing it's gonna be in tear

1354
01:08:03,559 --> 01:08:06,880
it's gonna be terrible you might as well

1355
01:08:04,910 --> 01:08:10,609
get like some Kleenex or something now

1356
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:13,369
actually my first circle as an attendee

1357
01:08:10,609 --> 01:08:15,288
was circle two and none of you know that

1358
01:08:13,369 --> 01:08:17,600
I don't think anyone on staff knows that

1359
01:08:15,289 --> 01:08:20,630
because I was so painfully introverted I

1360
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:23,029
didn't talk to anyone I was terrified of

1361
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:25,310
literally every single person in this

1362
01:08:23,029 --> 01:08:28,790
room but I really really really wanted

1363
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:32,000
to come to circle and one person reached

1364
01:08:28,790 --> 01:08:34,549
out to me and at the time I had no idea

1365
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,799
that he was super ops man doing

1366
01:08:34,549 --> 01:08:40,698
everything being super busy all the time

1367
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:43,189
he treated me just as important as he

1368
01:08:40,698 --> 01:08:45,589
was and he gave me a lot of time and

1369
01:08:43,189 --> 01:08:47,809
throughout those years he's given me a

1370
01:08:45,589 --> 01:08:49,189
lot of mentorship and he's been a real

1371
01:08:47,810 --> 01:08:51,440
inspiration for me but instead of

1372
01:08:49,189 --> 01:08:54,049
telling you what he's done for me I

1373
01:08:51,439 --> 01:08:55,849
would like to illustrate it to him

1374
01:08:54,049 --> 01:08:58,310
so you're all gonna help me embarrass

1375
01:08:55,850 --> 01:09:00,319
him for a second even if it's just a few

1376
01:08:58,310 --> 01:09:04,559
of you okay my mom wasn't involved in

1377
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:07,859
this was she no not yet

1378
01:09:04,559 --> 01:09:09,989
anyway so I know it might only be a few

1379
01:09:07,859 --> 01:09:13,559
of you but if this applies to you and

1380
01:09:09,988 --> 01:09:14,968
how grape has changed my life I'd like

1381
01:09:13,559 --> 01:09:16,980
you to raise your hand so if you are a

1382
01:09:14,969 --> 01:09:18,989
student of mine yeah they let me teach

1383
01:09:16,979 --> 01:09:20,189
that's so weird right now they let me

1384
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:22,948
teach if you were a student of mine

1385
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:25,138
raise your hand if I taught you how to

1386
01:09:22,948 --> 01:09:27,538
break and enter into large buildings of

1387
01:09:25,139 --> 01:09:31,049
12,000 people and then let you do so on

1388
01:09:27,538 --> 01:09:33,479
your own raise your hand if you are an

1389

01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:37,790
swear he was on the verge of tears

1458
01:12:35,090 --> 01:12:39,469
himself I don't know what I'm gonna do

1459
01:12:37,790 --> 01:12:41,420
we're about to go in the hole we're

1460
01:12:39,469 --> 01:12:43,250
gonna go bankrupt from this thing this

1461
01:12:41,420 --> 01:12:45,170
dude they like signed on for all this

1462
01:12:43,250 --> 01:12:50,360
thought he was gonna compete with Der

1463
01:12:45,170 --> 01:12:52,460
Beek on his first year come on like fine

1464
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:53,929
out of the kindness of my heart what do

1465
01:12:52,460 --> 01:12:57,620
you need I will help you you're my

1466
01:12:53,930 --> 01:12:59,810
friend I'm not gonna let you burn and so

1467
01:12:57,620 --> 01:13:02,900
it turned into the first year which was

1468
01:12:59,810 --> 01:13:04,910
an absolute show I mean it was from

1469
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:06,559
from beginning to end from our

1470
01:13:04,910 --> 01:13:08,570
perspective on the back of the house it

1471
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:10,070
was absolutely terrible and I'm so

1472
01:13:08,570 --> 01:13:12,889
thankful because we actually got a lot

1473
01:13:10,070 --> 01:13:16,670
of good feedback and at the end of it

1474
01:13:12,890 --> 01:13:19,460
after the entire no sleep of the weekend

1475
01:13:16,670 --> 01:13:21,560
because my role here is to make sure

1476
01:13:19,460 --> 01:13:23,910
that the trains run on time my role is

1477
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:26,040
to oversee once we get here

1478
01:13:23,910 --> 01:13:29,700
I would make sure that all of the the

1479
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:31,290
pieces kind of fall together and even

1480
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:33,330
though I haven't gotten to exercise that

1481
01:13:31,290 --> 01:13:35,100
I keep practicing my people tossing

1482
01:13:33,330 --> 01:13:40,380
skills so as I want to throw somebody

1483
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:42,390
over that damn rail so we survived and

1484
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:43,830
we were like okay well now what are we

1485
01:13:42,390 --> 01:13:45,660
gonna do this again like we get some

1486
01:13:43,830 --> 01:13:49,200
positive feedback it's starting to kind

1487
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:50,970
of feel good okay let's have a number

1488
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:52,740
two so we threw number two and that was

1489
01:13:50,970 --> 01:13:55,500
a hit and we realized that it was there

1490
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:57,269
wasn't a fluke so here we are but the

1491
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:59,970
bottom line ultimately like this isn't

1492
01:13:57,270 --> 01:14:03,420
something that really I think any of us

1493
01:13:59,970 --> 01:14:05,700
saw or wanted to take on and we're so

1494
01:14:03,420 --> 01:14:07,980
thankful for each of you for all of your

1495
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:10,410
support for everybody that comes back

1496
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:13,379
everybody that donates time that takes

1497
01:14:10,410 --> 01:14:15,180
the time to talk because this is as we

1498
01:14:13,380 --> 01:14:16,470
all have said to this point we owe

1499
01:14:15,180 --> 01:14:19,200
everybody that works on this conference

1500
01:14:16,470 --> 01:14:22,440
and mentoring growing teaching is a huge

1501
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:24,630
thing for us and we like to cater to

1502
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:27,150
that in the community it's a noobish

1503
01:14:24,630 --> 01:14:29,550
kind of vibe is really what we go for to

1504
01:14:27,150 --> 01:14:32,190
teach to those folks make people feel

1505
01:14:29,550 --> 01:14:39,480
wanted included that you can do this too

1506
01:14:32,190 --> 01:14:41,790
and now it's my turn so as I'm walking

1507
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:43,200
around like a chicken with my head cut

1508
01:14:41,790 --> 01:14:44,940
off and for those of you who've been

1509
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:47,280
here for a few years you may have seen

1510
01:14:44,940 --> 01:14:49,860
that yourself it can be a little crazy

1511
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:53,670
me hopped up on Monster drinks in five

1512
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:57,360
hours and no sleep and trying to prevent

1513
01:14:53,670 --> 01:14:59,700
from choking dr. Barrow and I come

1514
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:01,830
across this girl with these big doe eyes

1515
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:04,620
and she has no it's like she's like

1516
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:07,170
terrified of what's going on because she

1517
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:08,820
obviously doesn't know anybody and so I

1518
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:10,710
stopped and just talked and hey how you

1519
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:14,730
doing what's your name nice to meet you

1520
01:15:10,710 --> 01:15:17,280
you know knows nobody here is any more

1521
01:15:14,730 --> 01:15:23,610
special than anyone else we're all in

1522
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:26,370
this together and Alyssa was so sweet so

1523
01:15:23,610 --> 01:15:28,500
nice such a genuine kind person and I

1524
01:15:26,370 --> 01:15:30,330
just as I saw her throughout the

1525
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:31,620
conference I when I stopped and made it

1526
01:15:30,330 --> 01:15:33,120
a point to talk to her have you talked

1527
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:34,710
to anybody catch any good talks what

1528
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:37,230
have you seen

1529
01:15:34,710 --> 01:15:39,690
and she eventually started like every

1530
01:15:37,230 --> 01:15:41,700
time I turned around there she was so

1531
01:15:39,690 --> 01:15:44,160
it's clear like she did still was

1532
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:45,750
meeting people but she really took a

1533
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:48,570
shine and we really kind of clicked

1534
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:50,400
almost from the jump and it was a small

1535
01:15:48,570 --> 01:15:51,929
world because you've heard my mother's

1536
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:53,639
involved in the conference and I have a

1537
01:15:51,930 --> 01:15:55,710
sister that lives here locally who comes

1538
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:58,410
and visits while we're here in the area

1539
01:15:55,710 --> 01:16:01,620
and it just so happens that my sister

1540
01:15:58,410 --> 01:16:04,349
Tia tutored Alyssa sorry I see I'm

1541
01:16:01,620 --> 01:16:07,590
they've been going crazy now tutored

1542
01:16:04,350 --> 01:16:09,240
Alyssa in school and so small world she

1543
01:16:07,590 --> 01:16:12,240
was kind of a part of the extended

1544
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:15,120
family and learning more and more about

1545
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:18,269
her when I decided you know I don't

1546
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:20,160
really want this wait like it's heavy

1547
01:16:18,270 --> 01:16:22,050
it's everybody who reward works with a

1548
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:24,780
conference you realize how much goes

1549
01:16:22,050 --> 01:16:27,120
into it and I want to slow down I want

1550
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:28,800
to teach I want to do other stuff I want

1551
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:31,650
I start I thought you know she is so

1552
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:33,780
super organized she's got everything

1553
01:16:31,650 --> 01:16:35,580
under under control with I watched like

1554
01:16:33,780 --> 01:16:37,650
she's like a doctor of all kinds of

1555
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:39,960
crazy like car hacker and doing all this

1556
01:16:37,650 --> 01:16:42,269
stuff with teaching these wonderful kids

1557
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:45,960
and doing so much of the things that

1558
01:16:42,270 --> 01:16:48,030
means so much to me right and I thought

1559
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:50,400
you know you're here you're local

1560
01:16:48,030 --> 01:16:52,259
I'm not if I were decide to step out of

1561
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:54,059
my role would you want to get involved a

1562
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:56,580
little more with the conference and she

1563
01:16:54,060 --> 01:16:59,480
much like Mike Cooley made the mistake

1564
01:16:56,580 --> 01:17:02,640
of saying yes to me

1565
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:04,759
so that becomes I didn't tell her that

1566
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:07,020
the method to my madness was the

1567
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:10,590
evolution of where she's going to take

1568
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:14,010
over this role but ultimately Alyssa has

1569
01:17:10,590 --> 01:17:18,480
has been so instrumental in what this

1570
01:17:14,010 --> 01:17:20,640
con is becoming she has no issues with

1571
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:23,610
helping to make the trains run on time

1572
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:25,530
and I'll be completely honest I only had

1573
01:17:23,610 --> 01:17:27,719
one reservation about turning this stuff

1574
01:17:25,530 --> 01:17:29,370
over to her and that was from time to

1575
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:31,110
time you know they keep me around

1576
01:17:29,370 --> 01:17:34,340
because I'm big and ugly kind of scary

1577
01:17:31,110 --> 01:17:36,750
apparently that's what I hear

1578
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:38,730
so they keep me around to be scary and I

1579
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:41,430
thought you know somebody's gonna make

1580
01:17:38,730 --> 01:17:44,040
the mistake of telling her no and I'm

1581
01:17:41,430 --> 01:17:46,730
gonna have to exercise those people

1582
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:48,680
tossing skills

1583
01:17:46,730 --> 01:17:52,820
but the opportunity that presented

1584
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:55,820
itself and she shocked me to see the

1585
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:58,700
devil that can reside in this quiet

1586
01:17:55,820 --> 01:18:01,190
little girl that I mean it's it's

1587
01:17:58,700 --> 01:18:05,780
absolutely insane that she gave me the

1588
01:18:01,190 --> 01:18:08,000
chills for a quick second and so I am so

1589
01:18:05,780 --> 01:18:09,800
thankful that it's not the two to three

1590
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:12,020
year evolution that I was looking at to

1591
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:15,620
escape I was hoping not to see a decade

1592
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:18,460
of having to be up all weekend but to be

1593
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:21,530
able to walk away comfortably and know

1594
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:24,260
that all of you are in good hands

1595
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:27,019
so that's very important so I want to

1596
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:28,730
thank first of all of you who have ever

1597
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:31,300

1616
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:52,810
think oh wow I would love to see if

1617
01:19:50,830 --> 01:19:54,760
something even small really small could

1618
01:19:52,810 --> 01:19:57,220
happen in Indianapolis you know 50

1619
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:59,050
people even that'd be great

1620
01:19:57,220 --> 01:20:01,240
and so then I find out oh well there is

1621
01:19:59,050 --> 01:20:03,430
a Circle City con oh this is cool let's

1622
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:05,260
let's get involved so I ended up somehow

1623
01:20:03,430 --> 01:20:07,570
getting connected in with you and you

1624
01:20:05,260 --> 01:20:09,820
got me over to the NOC and and all that

1625
01:20:07,570 --> 01:20:12,009
at once say it was CFP so originally I

1626
01:20:09,820 --> 01:20:13,990
was gonna run the yeah that's right so I

1627
01:20:12,010 --> 01:20:18,610
was in for a talk but then yeah in for a

1628
01:20:13,990 --> 01:20:20,500
talk in for a staff position so so so I

1629
01:20:18,610 --> 01:20:22,120
hit on the NOC I ended up getting

1630
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:23,770
mentored on the NOC and I pretty much

1631
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:25,210
you know I'm running it and getting some

1632
01:20:23,770 --> 01:20:27,910
advice from the NOC leader at the time

1633
01:20:25,210 --> 01:20:30,130
and and then somewhere around January

1634
01:20:27,910 --> 01:20:31,690
February March I'm getting more emails

1635
01:20:30,130 --> 01:20:32,740

1666
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:44,449
because you're gonna be moving up at

1667
01:21:42,260 --> 01:21:48,099
some point I'm like what

1668
01:21:44,449 --> 01:21:53,360
he's tailoring me he's grooming me him

1669
01:21:48,099 --> 01:21:55,699
so yeah the puppet strings he he's been

1670
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:58,280
grooming me he's been mentoring me this

1671
01:21:55,699 --> 01:21:59,928
year I've mostly been autonomous on this

1672
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:01,489
there have been input from him I have

1673
01:21:59,929 --> 01:22:04,010
called him I've talked him he's taking

1674
01:22:01,489 --> 01:22:06,619
care of some stuff but he's mostly

1675
01:22:04,010 --> 01:22:08,150
trusted this year with with me and I

1676
01:22:06,619 --> 01:22:11,389
want to thank him for that

1677
01:22:08,150 --> 01:22:15,888
and as he's going to move up and I'm

1678
01:22:11,389 --> 01:22:22,389
going to take his position hey why don't

1679
01:22:15,889 --> 01:22:22,389
you come back get off my bridge

1680
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:34,950
so those you've been around me this

1681
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:37,110
weekend you know I've been in a bit of a

1682
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:47,550
melancholy mood just with all the fields

1683
01:22:37,110 --> 01:22:49,339
from all this happening and sorry it's

1684
01:22:47,550 --> 01:22:52,200
been a lot of sacrifice over the last

1685
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:55,710
six years last five years six years

1686
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:57,870
getting this conference going I didn't

1687
01:22:55,710 --> 01:22:59,340
know this route I never liked grape I

1688
01:22:57,870 --> 01:23:02,250
never planned on running a conference

1689
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:06,470
I'm like this is the stupidest thing why

1690
01:23:02,250 --> 01:23:06,470
the hell do people do this crap and

1691
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:10,590
sometimes you just have it thrust upon

1692
01:23:09,090 --> 01:23:12,600
you and it's you don't want to see

1693
01:23:10,590 --> 01:23:14,910
something fail and watching something

1694
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:17,760
fail I've never been one of those people

1695
01:23:14,910 --> 01:23:19,889
so I see it fail in my job I I feel I

1696
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:21,480
need to go fix it there's some

1697
01:23:19,890 --> 01:23:23,370
deep-seated psychological issues I'm

1698
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:28,759
sure but will you ask my shrink about

1699
01:23:23,370 --> 01:23:31,019
those so you're one getting involved and

1700
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:32,670
kind of taken it over and bring it at

1701
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:34,560
home and then look at your tomb going

1702
01:23:32,670 --> 01:23:36,600
okay we we had a pretty good run yeah it

1703
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:39,180
was a complete disaster in the back end

1704
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:41,040
but people that went had fun we had a

1705
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:42,660
lot of good feedback I was that Derby

1706
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:45,000
con and people kept coming up to me and

1707
01:23:42,660 --> 01:23:48,139
go oh wow he was people that run Circle

1708
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:53,510
City con we had a great time thank you

1709
01:23:48,140 --> 01:23:55,920
appreciate that and it's been that way

1710
01:23:53,510 --> 01:23:57,960
there's an interesting thing until you

1711
01:23:55,920 --> 01:24:01,020
run a con you never understand what it's

1712
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:03,270
like to run the con and you know if you

1713
01:24:01,020 --> 01:24:05,310
see how people sometimes the con runners

1714
01:24:03,270 --> 01:24:07,140
act at their cons whether they lose

1715
01:24:05,310 --> 01:24:09,840
their or they get upset or anything

1716
01:24:07,140 --> 01:24:11,160
like that once you run it you start to

1717
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:13,020
understand it because I remember seeing

1718
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:14,849
I remember seeing people and we're

1719
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:17,640
seeing Banshee is before I ran a con

1720
01:24:14,850 --> 01:24:21,410
loser shed why are you so stressed why

1721
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:27,540
are you doing that oh okay now I get it

1722
01:24:21,410 --> 01:24:28,200
and and this Banshee has literally run

1723
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:30,410
cons

1724
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:35,450
way bigger than anything I've ever done

1725
01:24:30,410 --> 01:24:38,250
so it's been one of those things where

1726
01:24:35,450 --> 01:24:41,070
it's been a growing experience for me

1727
01:24:38,250 --> 01:24:43,039
and watching watching literally my baby

1728
01:24:41,070 --> 01:24:44,989
grow up over the last six

1729
01:24:43,039 --> 01:24:46,608
years my original plan was to do this

1730
01:24:44,989 --> 01:24:48,259
for five years I kept on and decided

1731
01:24:46,609 --> 01:24:50,719
last year when they do one more year

1732
01:24:48,260 --> 01:24:54,889
when I did it I want to make sure we had

1733
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:56,659
the right infrastructure in place those

1734
01:24:54,889 --> 01:24:57,530
you don't know first two years was very

1735
01:24:56,659 --> 01:24:59,719
much

1736
01:24:57,530 --> 01:25:03,739
micromanaging bear it was literally

1737
01:24:59,719 --> 01:25:07,639
hands in every pie I remember still

1738
01:25:03,739 --> 01:25:10,818
sitting down and going to you know tell

1739
01:25:07,639 --> 01:25:12,409
the story we made it six years without

1740
01:25:10,819 --> 01:25:13,760
giving this man a heart attack I had to

1741
01:25:12,409 --> 01:25:16,938
literally sit him down after the first

1742
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:18,530
and say dude second you're a psycho take

1743
01:25:16,939 --> 01:25:19,939
a break you're gonna you're gonna Pat

1744
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:21,709
you're gonna crash if you don't like

1745
01:25:19,939 --> 01:25:25,280
start letting other people do some stuff

1746
01:25:21,709 --> 01:25:27,229
because he doesn't we were at shoeless

1747
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:29,299
during this conversation I mean he

1748
01:25:27,229 --> 01:25:32,929
literally didn't do this this is not

1749
01:25:29,299 --> 01:25:34,639
exaggeration but set me down and so

1750
01:25:32,929 --> 01:25:35,659
that's when I learned that I needed the

1751
01:25:34,639 --> 01:25:37,780
delegate and that's what we started

1752
01:25:35,659 --> 01:25:41,659
bringing on the team that we have

1753
01:25:37,780 --> 01:25:44,989
bringing in Banshee starting to prep Oh

1754
01:25:41,659 --> 01:25:48,438
Jay to eventually take over eventually

1755
01:25:44,989 --> 01:25:52,808
bringing on with bringing on lentile and

1756
01:25:48,439 --> 01:25:55,879
G getting smash is not here along with

1757
01:25:52,809 --> 01:25:57,319
as per the safety team getting some of

1758
01:25:55,879 --> 01:25:59,719
the other leaders like meat shield and

1759
01:25:57,319 --> 01:26:03,439
Joey involved getting Damian involved on

1760
01:25:59,719 --> 01:26:06,260
the sponsors yeah make sure Cooley Adria

1761
01:26:03,439 --> 01:26:11,299
and all those guys are doing their thing

1762
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:14,119
and taking care of it and so we've grown

1763
01:26:11,299 --> 01:26:15,889
it over the years and gotten to the

1764
01:26:14,119 --> 01:26:17,509
point where right now and I'll be honest

1765
01:26:15,889 --> 01:26:19,969
with you back that day I never saw it

1766
01:26:17,510 --> 01:26:21,909
get into this never did thought maybe

1767
01:26:19,969 --> 01:26:23,929
would be two three hundred people and

1768
01:26:21,909 --> 01:26:25,909
growing it to the level that we've grown

1769
01:26:23,929 --> 01:26:27,409
it and still seeing it to a point where

1770
01:26:25,909 --> 01:26:29,509
we've had to actually talk and say hey

1771
01:26:27,409 --> 01:26:32,058
do we want to go bigger do we want to

1772
01:26:29,510 --> 01:26:34,789
cap it at a certain size and having to
