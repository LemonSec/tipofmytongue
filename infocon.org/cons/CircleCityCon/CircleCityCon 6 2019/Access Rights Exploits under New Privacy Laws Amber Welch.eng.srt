1
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:14,879
are you good all right excellent

2
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:16,379
okay officially starting thank you so

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,420
thank you so much the organizers for

4
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:22,160
allowing me to give a keynote that's not

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,160
at 9:00 a.m. I really appreciate that

6
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:29,880
thank you so today we're going to be

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,500
talking about data access rights and

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,170
some of the evil things that you can do

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,850
with them and this is all space-themed I

10
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,870
couldn't be happier with the theme for

11
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:42,180
this I love space I wrote in my bio when

12
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,849
I was submitting the CFP that I

13
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,620
submitted to the Mars space mission

14
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,690
which is true so I was really thrilled

15
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,110
that this was a conference that asked me

16
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,110
to keynote

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,420
all right I guess we have to do this

18
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:09,310
manually so my name is Amber Welch I

19
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,950
evaluate corporate privacy programs for

20
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:16,240
a living I do both privacy audits and

21
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:19,660
readiness assessment for I think I lost

22
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:22,360
value again I do readiness assessments

23
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:24,850
for organizations that have privacy

24
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,440
programs that they need to make sure are

25
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:36,639
in compliance with certain privacy laws

26
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:43,750
so I feel good okay do you want me to

27
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:46,869
swap Mike okay all right let me know if

28
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:50,619
there's any issues so I evaluate

29
00:01:46,869 --> 00:01:51,820
programs from our Silicon Valley tech

30
00:01:50,619 --> 00:02:04,690
companies that you would all hear about

31
00:01:51,820 --> 00:02:11,530
startups big old enterprise it is it

32
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:13,900
okay well this let's try this again so

33
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:15,640
essentially I read privacy laws so that

34
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:24,550
you guys don't have to that's the moral

35
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:28,000
of the story today we're going to be

36
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:29,980
talking about the data subject access

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,739
rights that are available give you a

38
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:34,510
brief overview of that some of the

39
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:36,459
exploits that you can do with them and

40
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:39,790
then defense strategies if you'd like to

41
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:41,019
protect against those exploits so data

42
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:47,230
object requests

43
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:49,989
I call them them D SARS or SARS subject

44
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:51,340
access requests but we'll just go by DSR

45
00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:54,790
s you might see this with a different

46
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:58,930
acronym at some point so we are living

47
00:02:54,790 --> 00:03:01,630
in a global privacy era now there are

48
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:04,269
laws especially with gdpr that extend

49
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:06,160
beyond the borders of a region which is

50
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:08,739
how we've traditionally viewed privacy

51
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:13,540
so with the advent of this kind of

52
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:15,939
transnational compliance issue

53
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:19,239
people in America are starting to have

54
00:03:15,939 --> 00:03:22,750
to interpret privacy compliant or

55
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:25,090
European way so this is this is a big

56
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:28,120
change for US companies and many of them

57
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:30,549
are very unprepared for how to interpret

58
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:34,030
and abide by these laws so there are

59
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:36,640
access laws in most countries that do

60
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:40,019
have privacy laws everything from you

61
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,958
the u.s. Brazil the APEC region Canada

62
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:45,480
most access laws are similar everywhere

63
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:49,239
so there are some new challenges here

64
00:03:45,480 --> 00:04:05,200
with the GDP are we added metadata and

65
00:03:49,239 --> 00:04:07,299
indirect that cut out again we can just

66
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:24,729
switch to the stick maybe if it's a

67
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:27,220
problem yeah drop mic okay so so we've

68
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:29,650
added metadata and indirect identifiers

69
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:32,260
we've also added household and device

70
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:33,580
data with the California law CCPA

71
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,199
so this is going to be really

72
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:38,169
interesting especially when we're

73
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,810
looking at IOT and I think vehicle data

74
00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:44,049
will be a really interesting new aspect

75
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:46,180
of privacy law we also have added the

76
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:48,639
concept of linkable data so most people

77
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:51,610
when they think of PII they think very

78
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,949
much in terms of standard human readable

79
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:55,840
information that they can look at and

80
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:56,949
say this is a person's information it's

81
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,500
a it doesn't really work like that

82
00:04:56,949 --> 00:05:02,949
anymore now if data can be linked to a

83
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:04,210
person it's now personal data so we have

84
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:06,220
to kind of change how we're thinking

85
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:08,680
about what is personal data and what

86
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,940
needs to be protected like PII we're

87
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:13,690
also running into a really interesting

88
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:15,400
issue where data controllers the

89
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:18,430
organization's who are responsible for

90
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,840
the data are now potentially responsible

91
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:22,479
for data that they didn't intentionally

92
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,580
gather they still have to provide those

93
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,310
privacy rights even when they they

94
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,960
weren't the ones who meant

95
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:31,680
gather it so this is a kind of

96
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:34,859
controller without control concept an

97
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,870
example of this is this guy who sued

98
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,520
Google Spain because he wanted his

99
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,980
personal information removed from search

100
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,450
results Google's position was that's not

101
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:44,610
really our problem were a search engine

102
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:47,640
what do you really expect us to do but

103
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:49,890
the EU ruled in his favor and Google

104
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:52,919
Spain had to honor his data subject

105
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:54,510
requests the right to be forgotten this

106
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:58,170
is going to be really interesting for

107
00:05:54,510 --> 00:06:00,300
facial recognition technology so here we

108
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:01,860
might have potentially one of the best

109
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,840
ways to fight back against facial

110
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,640
recognition technology for public spaces

111
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,200
where people aren't really able to give

112
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:10,650
consent we might be able to use data

113
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:14,820
access laws - you know retrieve our data

114
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:16,260
and demand that it's forgotten so what

115
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,870
you want to remember from this is that

116
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:20,940
potentially any data is personal

117
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:22,560
information now even if it's not

118
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,960
currently personal data if it could be

119
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,590
linked to a person then it's it's

120
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:31,380
possibly PII so what if company's done

121
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:33,419
to deal with this mostly freak out

122
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:35,010
they've just panicked they don't know

123
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:37,080
how to deal with it American companies

124
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:39,510
in particular are not used to thinking

125
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,909
in terms of privacy as a right a human

126
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:43,740
right they think of it in a sectoral way

127
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:46,500
like this is health data this is

128
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:48,930
financial data this is card data that's

129
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,240
not how the EU thinks of personal data

130
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:53,340
and it's not something that Americans

131
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,430
are really used to so the response has

132
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:57,780
generally been just give all the data

133
00:06:55,430 --> 00:07:00,180
please don't sue us we don't want any

134
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:02,070
complaints most companies that are very

135
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,930
large or unfamiliar with this have

136
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:06,659
outsourced to legal firms which can be

137
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:08,280
pretty expensive and lawyers on the

138
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:12,510
whole don't tend to think as much about

139
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:15,270
security as all of you fine folks do so

140
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:17,460
generally most companies are more in

141
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:19,650
fear of non-compliance and getting

142
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:21,000
complaints for not honoring these rights

143
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:22,830
than they fear the breach of one

144
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,510
person's data even though it is a

145
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:28,380
portable breach if they provide that

146
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:29,820
information to a malicious attacker so

147
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,740
there are two different ways that data

148
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:34,800
subject requests can be fulfilled

149
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:36,720
there's the manual way which is the more

150
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,980
traditional version where you send in an

151
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,870
email or you tell them I want my data

152
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:42,520
and then they run off and gather

153
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:44,500
whatever they can and try to fulfill the

154
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,120
request they're also automated ways

155
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,760
which you can see with things like

156
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,430
Facebook where you can go in and click a

157
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:53,530
few buttons and they have scripts set up

158
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:55,150
to complete that process they're also

159
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:56,950
some that are hybrid where you might be

160
00:07:55,150 --> 00:08:00,030
able to initiate the process behind

161
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:02,830
authentication and then after that they

162
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:05,799
do some manual processing or approval

163
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:08,650
and then send you the data in an

164
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:11,200
automated way so both of these types

165
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:14,200
have different exploits that are

166
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,670
possible and organizations generally

167
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,940
decide which one they're going to do

168
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:20,380
based on the ROI the difficulty of

169
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:23,260
completing automated requests versus

170
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:28,480
manual requests they each have different

171
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:29,920
ID talen jiz and security challenges so

172
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,180
the stuff that you're here for all of

173
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:35,260
the evil things that you can do with

174
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:38,710
this right so my favorite one is what I

175
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:41,650
call legal DDoS the idea behind this is

176
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:43,780
that data subject requests can

177
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:46,480
potentially be very expensive especially

178
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:48,880
those manual ones so sometimes you'll

179
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,890
see a legitimate protest campaign maybe

180
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,540
or an educational campaign telling

181
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:55,689
people hey you have these rights here's

182
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:58,060
how to how to fulfill those rights or

183
00:08:55,690 --> 00:09:00,160
exercise those rights so in a scenario

184
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:03,219
like this you might have a company that

185
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,949
gets swarmed without any kind of warning

186
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:09,490
with data subject requests and they only

187
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:11,620
have 30 days to do it so in this case

188
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:14,620
they would probably have to outsource or

189
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:17,230
maybe extend the time line this is also

190
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:20,170
the only time that an a company would

191
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:22,300
really be able to be attacked with

192
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:23,890
boilerplate text generally during

193
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:26,140
fishing campaigns if you repeat the same

194
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:28,090
texts multiple times they know this is

195
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:31,439
fake that's not the case here because

196
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:34,210
it's very common it's like when you see

197
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,850
form letters to submit to your senator

198
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:38,560
because you want to make your point on

199
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:40,300
something known it's the same thing with

200
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,650
data subject requests companies are

201
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,900
going to have to prepare to see

202
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:45,250
boilerplate language and not be able to

203
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:48,160
use that as a way of vetting out

204
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:51,010
malicious requests this can be very

205
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,930
distracting for security and legal teams

206
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:54,910
so if this happens to an organization

207
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:56,439
it's very likely that they're going to

208
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:58,389
be all of their attention is going to be

209
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,620
taken up by this and maybe they wouldn't

210
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:02,410
be paying as much attention to other

211
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:04,690
areas this is also the type of attack

212
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:06,730
that is most effective against a company

213
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:08,440
that otherwise has a very strong privacy

214
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:09,910
program because there's not really very

215
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,920
much that they can do about it and it's

216
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:15,040
a way to waste resources essentially

217
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:17,319
this will also likely happen after any

218
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,389
kind of public data breach because

219
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,790
anyone who is affected is going to think

220
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:24,100
oh okay so I want to know what you have

221
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:26,500
on me if you got hacked so if your

222
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:29,410
organization has a publicly reportable

223
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:31,420
data breach this is going to very likely

224
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:32,949
naturally occur with that it should

225
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:37,630
potentially be an aspect of your

226
00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:41,500
incident responding response planning so

227
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:44,290
this guy out sourced this guy submitted

228
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:46,660
a data subject request that the company

229
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:48,370
outsourced to a legal firm and ended up

230
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:52,389
costing them a hundred and forty

231
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:54,399
thousand pounds to respond to that so in

232
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:56,199
cases where they have to do manual

233
00:10:54,399 --> 00:11:00,160
responses these can be very expensive

234
00:10:56,199 --> 00:11:03,399
data subject requests used to be they

235
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:06,670
used to be able to charge a $10 fee or

236
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:08,529
sorry 10 pound fee in the UK and the GDP

237
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:10,660
are removed that so data subject

238
00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:13,300
requests are completely free you are not

239
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:15,760
able to charge a fee for them so there's

240
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:18,339
really no disincentive to submitting a

241
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,019
bunch of them the only study I've been

242
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:23,740
able to find that tracked the average

243
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:25,630
cost of manual D SRS was in the UK and

244
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:29,139
their estimate was that the average

245
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:32,110
manual DSR costs a hundred and forty

246
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:33,339
five pounds for processing so even when

247
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:36,490
there was a ten pound

248
00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:38,139
disincentive it's still quite quite

249
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:42,130
expensive for the company so this can

250
00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:43,480
add up very quickly so I'll give you an

251
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,189
example of what this looks like in

252
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,889
practice

253
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:49,180
so Twitter thinks that I am a man this

254
00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:50,769
is something that you can find in your

255
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:52,239
Twitter settings if you want to go in

256
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:53,949
and look at your profile it will tell

257
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,339
you what Twitter's best guess about your

258
00:11:53,949 --> 00:12:00,990
gender would be so I thought whoa let's

259
00:11:57,339 --> 00:12:00,990
just ask the DPO why they think that

260
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:08,400
so I submit a DPO request and they took

261
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:12,329
about two two weeks to submit that to

262
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:13,980
respond with this they paid a lawyer to

263
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:16,020
write this this is what's really

264
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,940
interesting is that this is there's some

265
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:19,910
potentially generic language in there

266
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:22,500
but they actually had somebody go in

267
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:24,120
probably a lawyer read my stupid

268
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,730
question about why they decided I was a

269
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,350
man generate a response that was going

270
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:30,000
to stand up in court if I complained

271
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:31,800
about it and send it back to me and I

272
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,350
have the right to just keep asking them

273
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,240
questions about this if I want to and

274
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:38,670
then we could all do this and imagine

275
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:43,170
how much time in legal fees that would

276
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:44,939
take for them also I don't know if any

277
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:47,250
of you saw this on going around Twitter

278
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:51,150
recently did how many of you remember

279
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:53,160
ship your enemy's glitter yeah okay so

280
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:56,250
somebody took the same idea and decided

281
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:58,920
to ship your enemies gdpr

282
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:02,780
which is kind of the natural outcome I

283
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:05,370
think of a law like this so this is a a

284
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:08,790
website where you can go in and generate

285
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:11,940
a form that makes every possible legal

286
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:14,760
request for a data subject it the form

287
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:17,190
exercises every single right and all you

288
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:21,120
do is copy it to your clipboard and then

289
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:23,880
send it in so I'm kind of surprised it

290
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,130
took a year to find this one but here it

291
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,660
is and and I don't know what's going to

292
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:29,640
happen ultimately but I think this is

293
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:32,819
potentially a an area where we're gonna

294
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:34,350
see a lot of abuse I I also want to

295
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,270
remind you that this is completely legal

296
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:38,670
this is a even though it's dumb and

297
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:41,880
obviously malicious you can't turn it

298
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:43,290
down just because it's malicious legally

299
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:46,410
there this has been challenged in court

300
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:48,030
a company cannot say we don't want to

301
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:50,969
process this request because we think

302
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:53,130
it's mean or vindictive or petty they

303
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:54,480
still have to do it the one thing about

304
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:57,750
this is I wouldn't recommend using this

305
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,970
because it does say that you have

306
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:02,220
included a copy of your documentation

307
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:04,520
which we'll get into why that might be

308
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:09,330
an issue later

309
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:12,949
so the fishing this is well well the

310
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:15,040
ddos is potentially more of a manual

311
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:17,820
manual dsr

312
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:21,459
fishing can go both ways so you can

313
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:23,920
escalate an automated DSR by complaining

314
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:25,779
about it if you think that it wasn't

315
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,329
sufficient you still have the right to

316
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:31,029
contact that company so there are quite

317
00:14:28,329 --> 00:14:33,279
a few things that you can do to kind of

318
00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:36,149
mess with people and one thing to keep

319
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:39,730
in mind is that you're always able to

320
00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:42,430
contact a company and ask for a data

321
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:44,350
subject request verbally so that means

322
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:46,420
that for any people who like to do

323
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:48,819
social engineering you get to have Tier

324
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:51,759
one support on the phone talking about

325
00:14:48,819 --> 00:14:53,949
personal data so this is an area where

326
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:56,319
you can really continue attacking them

327
00:14:53,949 --> 00:14:58,660
quite often and just at worst you're

328
00:14:56,319 --> 00:15:00,490
tagged as an annoying person but they do

329
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:04,170
have to continue fulfilling these

330
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:06,579
requests even if it's not over email

331
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:09,009
another thing that you can do is to ask

332
00:15:06,579 --> 00:15:11,019
for the privacy officer this is kind of

333
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:12,490
an assent tactic so you can learn a

334
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:15,310
little bit more about whether they have

335
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:17,319
a privacy officer if they have a legal

336
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:19,959
team or a privacy team or security team

337
00:15:17,319 --> 00:15:21,670
working on these requests another thing

338
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:23,739
that you can do if you don't have access

339
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,910
to the email address for the person

340
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,620
you're attacking and you would like to

341
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:29,380
get that data you can just tell them

342
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:32,199
that you can't access that email there's

343
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:34,329
no provision in either the CCPA or gdpr

344
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:36,160
that they can reject a request just

345
00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:41,079
because you don't have access to that

346
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:43,899
email you can also try to get

347
00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:46,060
identification verification with other

348
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:48,610
data that you already have access to if

349
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:50,290
you have a different data set you can

350
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:52,060
guess at some things that might be

351
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:54,250
associated with that individual and

352
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:57,219
potentially get additional information

353
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:59,649
from a different company you can also

354
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:01,120
escalate with family names CCPA in

355
00:15:59,649 --> 00:16:04,029
particular has really introduced that

356
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,920
household concept so if you get access

357
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:07,389
with one person's information you can

358
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,420
see if they have any relatives and

359
00:16:07,389 --> 00:16:11,199
probably get their information as well

360
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:13,589
another thing that you can do is

361
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:16,269
escalate to higher value data if you get

362
00:16:13,589 --> 00:16:19,269
identification verification for low-risk

363
00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:21,610
data and they don't have any procedures

364
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:24,160
that show how you would still have a

365
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:26,500
barrier to higher value data then you

366
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,390
might be able to get more sensitive

367
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,720
information

368
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:32,910
without any additional checks another

369
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,769
thing that you can do is use very common

370
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:38,279
names how many of you have what you

371
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:38,670
would consider a common name I certainly

372
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:42,140
do

373
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:46,140
you get other people's emails yeah okay

374
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:49,050
so do I it's fun so when you think about

375
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:52,910
identity like who you are what does your

376
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:56,430
name really say about who you truly are

377
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:58,410
not really very much right I there are

378
00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:00,540
at least 20 other people with my name

379
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:03,269
because I get all of their email it's a

380
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:05,549
lot so I can very easily impersonate

381
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:08,929
another amber Welch there's one in the

382
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:11,939
UK she has her doctorate I know that she

383
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:14,309
volunteers at the science fair for her

384
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:16,410
local school I know which tube she takes

385
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:18,000
because I get the updates for the

386
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,949
construction project that's going on

387
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,900
there so I have a lot of information

388
00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:24,770
about her and many people probably have

389
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:28,650
information about me for the same thing

390
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:30,418
when you're thinking about data subject

391
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:33,570
requests and the identification

392
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:35,700
procedures behind them keep in mind that

393
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:37,710
the identity is not the identity of the

394
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:40,650
human being is not necessarily the most

395
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:43,020
important aspect what does for example a

396
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:44,910
passport really tell you about a person

397
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:47,370
how do you know for sure that that's

398
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:48,960
connected correctly to a data record

399
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:53,549
that just has that person's first and

400
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,960
last name so what can you do with

401
00:17:53,549 --> 00:17:56,730
phishing why would you even want to do

402
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,100
this aside from just getting somebody's

403
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:01,440
personal information some things that

404
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,449
you can do are to confirm profile data

405
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,679
if you have a different data record and

406
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,440
you want to make sure that that's the

407
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:09,360
right person you might be able to

408
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:12,210
identify other pieces of information

409
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,129
about that person you can match users

410
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:15,690
across datasets if you have multiple

411
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:18,299
data sets with personal data and you

412
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:19,590
want to link up records to get a fuller

413
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:22,320
picture of someone you would be able to

414
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:24,510
do that learning new information about

415
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:28,649
them obviously this is also I think

416
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:30,299
highly volatile for spearfishing and CEO

417
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:31,919
fraud because if you're doing a highly

418
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:34,500
targeted campaign and you want a lot of

419
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:37,260
information about someone attacking a

420
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,940
different company with a data subject

421
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,820
request would probably give you some

422
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,410
information

423
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:43,389
you could use to impersonate that person

424
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:47,410
in the target company that you're

425
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:49,180
actually going after there are a few

426
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:51,760
other malicious requests that people

427
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:54,400
have been doing one of them is guerilla

428
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:58,360
marketing where privacy vendors will

429
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:00,130
submit fake DSR s just to be annoying so

430
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:02,800
that they can show how annoying it

431
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:06,250
really is with the idea that eventually

432
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:09,159
somebody will cave and buy a vendor

433
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:12,100
solution or outsource to another firm to

434
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:14,230
deal with the requests I don't see why I

435
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:16,409
would want to get that vendor but you

436
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:19,630
know hey I'm not in sales

437
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:21,910
another thing is competitor research you

438
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:25,210
can learn about an organization similar

439
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:27,520
to yours by submitting requests you can

440
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:29,350
learn about their process or you might

441
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:34,600
be able to learn about their internal

442
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:37,840
structure as well disgruntled employees

443
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:39,820
are have been using data subject

444
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:43,899
requests in the EU at least for quite a

445
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:47,139
long time to waste resources and just

446
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:49,420
generally pester the company that they

447
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:53,260
used to work for when they have left on

448
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:55,540
bad terms related to that in employment

449
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:58,390
law a lot of lawyers have been using

450
00:19:55,540 --> 00:20:01,060
data subject requests as free discovery

451
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:05,110
tools and as a way of manipulating

452
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:09,100
companies into settling if they feel

453
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:10,540
attacked by data subject requests and

454
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,459
the most concerning one that I've heard

455
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:14,260
about is the potential for intimate

456
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:17,260
partner violence stalking and harassment

457
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:19,090
it's very easy to impersonate a loved

458
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:20,830
one right you know so much about them

459
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:23,679
there's almost nothing that would be

460
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:25,449
secret in this case so if you're going

461
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:27,190
based on something like security

462
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:28,750
questions then it's likely that a person

463
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:31,840
would be able to access things like

464
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:34,240
location data messaging data and photos

465
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:37,750
which can be very damaging in this in

466
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:40,570
this scenario so if you want to evaluate

467
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:43,090
a privacy policy you want to kind of get

468
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:45,310
a sense of how strong a privacy program

469
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:48,100
actually is then go to the privacy

470
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:50,110
policy online and and check to see when

471
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,209
it was last updated if it's very vague

472
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:53,500
or is very old it's possible that they

473
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,080
don't spend a lot of time thinking about

474
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,909
their pride

475
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:59,600
program it might be a great target for

476
00:20:55,909 --> 00:21:01,370
an exploit like this also if they don't

477
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,689
have any privacy or security officer

478
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:04,189
it's probably an organization that

479
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:08,690
doesn't invest a lot of resources in

480
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:11,539
this topic this is a alluvial diagram

481
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:13,460
from an organization called private org

482
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:15,289
you just go in there put in the URL of

483
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:16,730
the privacy policy you want and then you

484
00:21:15,289 --> 00:21:18,260
don't have to read it which is great

485
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:20,659
because who wants to read a privacy

486
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:23,200
policy and then you'll get a high-level

487
00:21:20,659 --> 00:21:26,179
overview of what they include and

488
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:28,460
generally the complexity of the policy

489
00:21:26,179 --> 00:21:31,340
itself so the strong one you can see has

490
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:33,799
a lot of information they give a lot of

491
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:36,110
detail while the week one ends in

492
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:40,220
unspecified choice it doesn't really

493
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:43,090
give any details so there are a few

494
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:45,230
common profiles of weak targets

495
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:46,939
companies that have a lot of indirect

496
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:49,010
identifiers that aren't necessarily

497
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:51,139
associated with account data will have a

498
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:53,629
more difficult time identifying data

499
00:21:51,139 --> 00:21:55,490
subjects also international charities

500
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:58,490
are a good target because they're

501
00:21:55,490 --> 00:22:00,049
generally required to comply with a lot

502
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:01,789
of different privacy laws without

503
00:22:00,049 --> 00:22:03,679
necessarily having a very large budget

504
00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:05,149
to do it also people who work for

505
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,049
charities want to be helpful which is

506
00:22:05,149 --> 00:22:09,199
great when you're doing social

507
00:22:06,049 --> 00:22:11,389
engineering social media startups are

508
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,279
another area where people tend to be a

509
00:22:11,389 --> 00:22:14,779
little less concerned about compliance

510
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:17,120
they're more interested in monetizing

511
00:22:14,779 --> 00:22:19,399
data less interested in protecting it

512
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,469
the same thing with small and medium

513
00:22:19,399 --> 00:22:23,719
businesses in minimally regulated

514
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:25,909
industries so for example this would be

515
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:28,130
maybe hotels where there's not a lot of

516
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:29,990
regulation aside from just general

517
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:31,809
privacy laws but they do actually have a

518
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:35,149
lot of data that would be very useful

519
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:38,779
also applications that don't have to f8

520
00:22:35,149 --> 00:22:42,590
are going to be a big target very

521
00:22:38,779 --> 00:22:44,899
infamously Spotify doesn't have to FA so

522
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:46,610
I found this on Twitter someone had a

523
00:22:44,899 --> 00:22:48,379
data subject request maliciously

524
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:51,110
submitted because their credentials were

525
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:54,769
compromised this seems like a kind of an

526
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:56,330
obvious problem but Spotify is quite

527
00:22:54,769 --> 00:23:00,590
certain that it doesn't want to add to a

528
00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:02,870
fait for some reason so let me show you

529
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:05,029
what an automated data subject request

530
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:06,949
looks like in Twitter so all you have to

531
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:07,770
do is you go into your settings you have

532
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:09,900
to put in your power

533
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:12,750
through it again it doesn't prompt a

534
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:14,730
second to FA even though I have two FA

535
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:16,380
on my account it doesn't really Kate

536
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:19,170
with that second factor to get to this

537
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:22,800
this screen all you do is click request

538
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:25,340
data and then you go away because it

539
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:28,169
just says that it's working and

540
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:31,530
eventually you get an email that says

541
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:33,330
the data is ready I find this a little

542
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:34,230
problematic since you do have to

543
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:37,020
authenticate

544
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:38,550
I did tell Twitter that this seemed like

545
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:42,330
a problem they're still looking into

546
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:43,680
finding the solution to it so all you do

547
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:45,570
is click that link and it takes you back

548
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:48,210
to the same screen and you click

549
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:49,800
download simple as that I do want to

550
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:51,180
point out that during this waiting

551
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:54,210
period which was only about an hour

552
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:55,950
there's no email notification that this

553
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:58,140
request had been submitted there's no

554
00:23:55,950 --> 00:24:02,970
visible banner or anything in the UI

555
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:04,950
that would say this had happened this is

556
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:06,930
all of the information that you're able

557
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:09,330
to get in one hour with nothing other

558
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:11,820
than just the password it is the

559
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:14,699
entirety of your metadata your messaging

560
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:16,470
your media essentially everything that

561
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,790
you have ever done on Twitter and for

562
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:22,550
some of you that may be ten years of

563
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:26,330
personal data is very easily compromised

564
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:28,740
so this is kind of terrifying I think

565
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:31,280
we've known about this as a potential

566
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:33,810
problem for over 40 years

567
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:36,470
academics in particular and policymakers

568
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:38,760
have been talking about this as an issue

569
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:40,500
subject access rights would probably

570
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,850
increase the incidence of personal

571
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:44,040
records being accidentally or

572
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:46,409
deliberately opened to third parties and

573
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:50,550
yet how many of you before today ever

574
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:51,480
really thought about this topic right

575
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:53,310
not very many

576
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,230
one of the problems with that is that

577
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:57,300
legal teams have been running privacy

578
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:59,610
for so long and haven't really been

579
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:00,960
getting advice from security teams for

580
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:03,750
some reason lawyers and security people

581
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,790
just are like oil and water they don't

582
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:07,290
get along that well and I would like to

583
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:10,440
change that because I think that this is

584
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:13,830
why we've gotten to such a such a poor

585
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:15,570
place with privacy rights so now that

586
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:19,320
you know about all of these scary things

587
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:20,550
what can you do in defense so there's

588
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,750
three primary things that we're trying

589
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:23,790
to accomplish

590
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:25,799
these are the threats that we're trying

591
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:28,320
to strike an appropriate balance between

592
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:30,240
we don't want to do invasive identity

593
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,740
checks so we don't want to be gathering

594
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,419
a lot of sensitive information that

595
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:35,429
doesn't actually do anything to identify

596
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:39,330
a person right because that's just more

597
00:25:35,429 --> 00:25:41,309
data and potentially exploitive we also

598
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:42,840
don't want to simply deny access to

599
00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:44,610
everyone because then what's the point

600
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:46,379
of even having privacy rights also you

601
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:49,080
might get sued because that defense

602
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:51,059
doesn't go too far but at the same time

603
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,470
if you give information to someone who

604
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:54,899
is a malicious attacker that's a

605
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:56,580
reportable data breach so we have to hit

606
00:25:54,900 --> 00:26:00,570
that narrowband between all three of

607
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:03,000
those items so this is how a DSR process

608
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:06,178
usually works a request comes in through

609
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,150
like a generic form or an email inbox

610
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:11,460
somebody does intake sorts that is valid

611
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:13,559
or invalid and then decides who it goes

612
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:16,110
to next for processing high-risk items

613
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:18,809
generally go to legal and then any kind

614
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:22,049
of manual processing gets sent to IT or

615
00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:24,270
a DBA usually there is no security

616
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:26,370
review whatsoever on this the procedures

617
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:28,320
usually just say something like identify

618
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:30,809
the person if it says that at all

619
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:33,210
there's no instruction how to identify

620
00:26:30,809 --> 00:26:35,280
the person there's no expectation for

621
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:36,840
the standard of proof and there really

622
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,549
isn't usually any kind of information

623
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,049
about what documentation needs to be

624
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:42,299
retained to show that you did

625
00:26:40,049 --> 00:26:44,490
appropriately identify that person also

626
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:46,950
I've never seen a company include

627
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:48,750
procedures for how to validate a mailing

628
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:50,460
address for paper copies which is one of

629
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:51,720
the things that you can request so if

630
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,850
you don't have access to that email

631
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,200
address you can ask for it to be mailed

632
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:57,178
to you and if the company doesn't have

633
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,070
your mailing address on file what do

634
00:26:57,179 --> 00:27:01,910
they know that's probably your address

635
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:04,320
right that's what you asked for

636
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:07,169
so some of the challenges with this are

637
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:09,030
linking the data with one person so

638
00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:10,830
again with that issue of the name how do

639
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:13,080
you know for sure that you have the

640
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:16,049
correct data subject even if they have

641
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:18,090
the same name also especially under the

642
00:27:16,049 --> 00:27:19,530
California law it specifically says you

643
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:21,120
can't require somebody to have an

644
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,840
account in order to submit these

645
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,939
requests

646
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,500
you also can't collect excessive

647
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:27,179
information for the purpose of

648
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:29,370
identifying somebody and the

649
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:31,580
identification can't be burdensome so

650
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:33,959
you'll get in trouble just as much for

651
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:34,960
collecting too much data about someone

652
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,720
to identify them

653
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:40,450
also even even things like the gov dot

654
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:41,800
uk' verify service is only 51%

655
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:44,620
successful and that is their own

656
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:46,290
statistic so the chances that it's even

657
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:50,229
worse than that are pretty high

658
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:52,090
also remember Aidid documents when they

659
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:54,220
don't actually help you identify someone

660
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:55,449
just become additional sensitive

661
00:27:54,220 --> 00:28:00,780
information that you're now responsible

662
00:27:55,450 --> 00:28:05,080
for so remember you don't need to see

663
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:07,480
identification and this is you think

664
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:09,340
that this is obvious right it seems kind

665
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,350
of simple when you describe it like this

666
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:12,790
but a lot of companies still do this

667
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:16,090
Google used to do this for the longest

668
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:18,129
time and this is generally what would be

669
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:21,429
considered an abusive identity check

670
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:23,410
it's not necessary it doesn't help and

671
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:25,990
it doesn't really give you anything

672
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:27,180
other than you know a higher-risk data

673
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:29,680
set for that person

674
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:31,300
also if you incorrectly combine

675
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,950
somebody's documentation with another

676
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:35,710
person then you've really cause problems

677
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:38,370
for yourself how many of you use a

678
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:42,190
twitter handle that is not your name

679
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:44,350
okay most of you right so imagine if

680
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:46,690
somebody came in and just submitted

681
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:48,909
documentation and claimed that Twitter

682
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:50,800
handle as yours because they submitted a

683
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:52,570
passport or maybe had like the same

684
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,490
first name you have a first name as part

685
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:55,899
of your Twitter handle that's a problem

686
00:28:54,490 --> 00:29:01,080
right that's that's not something that

687
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:03,730
is an ideal way of identifying a person

688
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:06,399
so there are really only two good

689
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:08,860
methods of identification you can use

690
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:10,690
documentation if you already had that

691
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:13,360
data so if you already have a passport

692
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:15,370
number fine go ahead and take a passport

693
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:18,159
but you should definitely get a scan for

694
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:19,330
it because passport numbers are not you

695
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,820
know they're pretty easily available

696
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:23,439
they're leaked everywhere right same

697
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:24,840
thing with driver's license numbers if

698
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,310
you can see that that person actually

699
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,659
possesses that identity document then

700
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:31,810
sure that might be a good way to

701
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:33,460
identify them the other good way which

702
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:35,800
is I think the best way to identify

703
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:38,980
somebody is to operate on the basis of

704
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:42,220
shared transaction history so for

705
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:43,900
example with a hotel you can say well

706
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:46,210
this is the date of the last day that I

707
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:48,370
had there potentially the room number if

708
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:50,800
you remember it but if you know when you

709
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:52,300
stayed there then you have information

710
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,340
that proves that you are the correct

711
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:56,470
data subject not necessarily that it's

712
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:57,970
just the same name but if you do that

713
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:59,770
you want to make sure that you're

714
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:01,570
gathering more than one piece of

715
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:04,629
information because a lot of this data

716
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:06,309
could be very incidental that just you

717
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:09,250
know if we go and hang out at the hotel

718
00:30:06,309 --> 00:30:10,930
bar after this talk I'm going to know

719
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:12,610
where you were staying at the hotel if

720
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:14,140
you pay with your card I can just pick

721
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:16,209
up a receipt and that's one piece of

722
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:18,190
data so you want to ask for a second

723
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:20,020
factor of data with the shared

724
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:21,730
transaction history something like the

725
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:27,760
last four digits of the credit card on

726
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:31,990
file or similar does anybody know what

727
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:34,900
this terrible pixel art is yes this is

728
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:36,970
the Arecibo message this is the Arecibo

729
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:39,190
radio satellite in Puerto Rico which is

730
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:40,090
incredible if you ever get the chance to

731
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:46,600
go see it

732
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:49,320
James Bond is a fan so the Arecibo the

733
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:52,780
Arecibo message is intended to establish

734
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:55,419
shared communication history between us

735
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:58,120
and some unidentified intelligent

736
00:30:55,420 --> 00:31:00,820
lifeform so we don't really need to know

737
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:02,590
who they are they don't need to know who

738
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:04,659
we are but if we got back another

739
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:06,730
message that was maybe slightly altered

740
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:07,470
or just repeated back to us we would

741
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:09,910
know that we had established

742
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:10,780
communication so the identity isn't

743
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:12,940
what's important

744
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:14,740
the shared transaction history is how

745
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:19,110
you can confirm that you know who you're

746
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:19,110
talking to and that it's the same person

747
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:26,260
so if you do manual data subject request

748
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:29,290
responses and you're going to be taking

749
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:31,660
IDs you need to have a graduated

750
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:33,879
identity requirement for different types

751
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:36,070
of data if you have highly sensitive

752
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:37,240
data don't release that on on

753
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:40,780
lower-level

754
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:43,660
ID this is really critical especially

755
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:47,620
where you might have payment data health

756
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:50,860
data anything that is potentially

757
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:53,199
sensitive politically sexually those

758
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:54,790
items should not be released very easily

759
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,220
but at the same time you don't want to

760
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:59,020
be wasting these really burning some ID

761
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:01,420
requirements on someone who just wants

762
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:02,340
to get some messaging data so make sure

763
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,690
that you understand the

764
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:07,799
difference between your sensitive data

765
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:09,720
and generally low-risk data you also

766
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:13,230
want to assume that ID numbers are

767
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:14,700
compromised most of us have a lot of our

768
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:16,650
information on the dark web at this

769
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:18,150
point you don't want somebody to just be

770
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:19,950
getting all of your personal data

771
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:21,210
through a data subject request because

772
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:22,590
they were able to find your passport

773
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:24,779
number on the Internet

774
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:26,850
so make sure that you're getting a scan

775
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:29,850
of the document but also don't make

776
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:32,719
somebody email the scans please I will

777
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:35,070
know if you do that I will come find you

778
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,289
so make sure you're providing a secure

779
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:39,779
method of transfer both for the data out

780
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:42,809
and for any ID requirements that you

781
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:45,240
have coming into you if you really have

782
00:32:42,809 --> 00:32:47,850
a lot of data that you want to carefully

783
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:49,649
consider this has digital identity

784
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:51,750
guidelines which are quite good so this

785
00:32:49,649 --> 00:32:55,739
is a way that you can really feel

786
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:58,169
confident in your ID method if you have

787
00:32:55,740 --> 00:33:00,029
automated D SRS you want to make sure

788
00:32:58,169 --> 00:33:01,980
that you re authenticate the session if

789
00:33:00,029 --> 00:33:03,720
there's two FA ask for the second factor

790
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:06,659
again there have been a lot of

791
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:08,100
credential leaks lately so imagine how

792
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:11,010
devastating it will be for somebody

793
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:13,379
whose entire twitter history is gone in

794
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:16,649
the space of an hour because you didn't

795
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:19,679
really kate also includes some kind of

796
00:33:16,649 --> 00:33:22,500
UI notice so that users who are actually

797
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:24,120
using that session will get some kind of

798
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:26,370
warning you want to make sure that if

799
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:27,539
somebody submits a malicious request

800
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:29,639
because they gained access to the

801
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:31,350
account that that user has some kind of

802
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:34,110
way of knowing that this has happened a

803
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:36,719
UI banner email notification and text

804
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:39,090
notification something that gives them

805
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,610
some warning also if your automated

806
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:43,260
request process is really fast and can

807
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:44,969
do it immediately I would still say you

808
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:47,279
could wait a week you have 30 days to

809
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:49,409
complete these requests so give the user

810
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,760
time to notice that something has gone

811
00:33:49,409 --> 00:33:53,429
wrong with their account before you just

812
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:55,200
deliver all of the data give them an

813
00:33:53,429 --> 00:33:56,340
opportunity to log into that account and

814
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,649
see that there's something potentially

815
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:00,600
wrong and give them some kind of way of

816
00:33:58,649 --> 00:34:02,699
knowing what to do about it

817
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:06,779
don't just tell them to ignore it please

818
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:08,369
please Twitter change that also campaign

819
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:10,500
for two factor authentication this is

820
00:34:08,369 --> 00:34:13,139
the single greatest thing that we can do

821
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:16,080
to prevent malicious requests is just

822
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:18,360
get a second factor on those accounts

823
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:20,969
even if you do offer to FA a lot of

824
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:23,070
times users need a push so talk to your

825
00:34:20,969 --> 00:34:25,290
product teams and try to get them to do

826
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:27,420
another campaign some kind of awareness

827
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:30,710
campaign to educate users about the

828
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:33,929
importance of why they should have to FA

829
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:35,490
so there are a few red flags here one

830
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:38,010
thing that's challenging about this type

831
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:40,109
of attack is that if you fall for it you

832
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:43,200
probably won't know you'll probably be

833
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:45,090
attacked multiple times and you may

834
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:48,060
never really identify that you're the

835
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:50,850
one leaking that data so detection is

836
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:52,590
much harder for one data record at a

837
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:53,880
time versus one large breach where

838
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,980
there's a lot of forensics that we can

839
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:58,560
get there's not much to do forensic ly

840
00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:00,180
when you've got a legal sign-off and

841
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:03,360
your lawyer is the one who sent the data

842
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:03,899
out knowingly so a couple of things to

843
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,360
look for

844
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:09,270
anytime that somebody is requesting a

845
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:11,310
male copy of their data to a new address

846
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:13,230
that hasn't been on file or when they

847
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:14,970
ask for a male copy and they never had

848
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:18,750
an address associated with that record

849
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:20,520
in the first place anytime you have

850
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:22,500
common names so if there are multiple

851
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:24,600
names in your database this would more

852
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:26,700
an additional review especially if you

853
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:28,710
have a deduplication algorithm in place

854
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:30,180
and that record has ever been combined

855
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,890
you want to make sure that you're highly

856
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:33,390
confident that it's the correct

857
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:37,190
combination because an error in

858
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:40,140
duplication would be quite problematic

859
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:41,790
any requests based on indirect

860
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:44,339
identifiers especially where there's no

861
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:46,950
account data - it would be something

862
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:48,780
that you want to especially consider and

863
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:51,210
make that determination of whether you

864
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:53,310
are even able to correctly identify that

865
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:54,420
person at all this might be a scenario

866
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:58,230
where you would just have to deny the

867
00:35:54,420 --> 00:36:00,150
request requests that don't have any

868
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:01,950
kind of account associated to it or

869
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:04,260
don't have any history in the account or

870
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:06,120
if the data subject can't recall any

871
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:08,720
history these would be warning signs

872
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:11,700
that you would want to watch for

873
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,770
frequent similar requests or repeated

874
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:16,109
texts we do know that there's

875
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:17,670
boilerplate language but if you do find

876
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:21,420
yourself getting a lot of it that would

877
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:23,640
be something to watch for and generally

878
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:25,650
any unexplained increase in data subject

879
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:28,310
request volume would be an indicator

880
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:29,780
that unless you know why that's happened

881
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:34,400
you might have some kind of malicious

882
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:37,220
attack going on so please remember

883
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,230
sending out data that's not to the

884
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:41,390
correct person is a data breach

885
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:43,310
it's it's not just a mistake it's a

886
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:47,270
reportable data breach that you have to

887
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:52,040
notify all right this is pretty dense so

888
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:54,500
here's my cat we're almost through so

889
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:56,240
your final line of defense is simply

890
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:58,310
denying requests and you have every

891
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:00,290
right to do this you're in fact your

892
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:02,240
default position should be to deny a

893
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:04,820
request unless it's proven ballot don't

894
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,830
default to you know just fulfilling

895
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:08,240
every request that comes in unless you

896
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:10,430
get the spidey sense that something is

897
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:12,379
wrong they should be passing barriers

898
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:15,589
and gateways to get that request

899
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:18,080
fulfilled instead of vice versa so if

900
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:20,450
you do need to deny the request all you

901
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:22,400
have to do is document your reasoning

902
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:24,649
for doing that and let the data subject

903
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:28,100
know that they have the ability to make

904
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:29,360
a complaint or escalate it to some kind

905
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:31,220
of authority this is kind of your

906
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,960
get-out-of-jail-free card because it

907
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:34,910
shows that you had the intention to do

908
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,500
the right thing and you won't just get

909
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:38,569
sued for doing this you'll have an

910
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:39,470
opportunity to fix it if they do want to

911
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:41,720
complain about it

912
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:43,759
so remember you won't necessarily get in

913
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:47,419
trouble for denying a request if you had

914
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:50,620
a good reason for doing it so these are

915
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:53,090
all the legal reasons that you can

916
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:55,819
reject requests and at the end I'll give

917
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:58,370
you a link to a github that has all of

918
00:37:55,820 --> 00:38:00,080
the legal text links as well with the

919
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:01,730
the text written out so that you don't

920
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,790
have to go through and read the entire

921
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:06,650
gdpr or CCPA

922
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:09,350
so you're allowed to reject any kind of

923
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:10,400
repetitive or abusive requests so this

924
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:11,810
is something where you'd want to keep a

925
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,180
good track of what you had gotten

926
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:16,400
previously if somebody is just clearly

927
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:17,419
being a pain then you are able to say

928
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,280
okay enough is enough

929
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:22,820
stop bugging us these lawyers are

930
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:25,400
getting really expensive you can also

931
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:27,650
reject if you have unconformity this is

932
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,480
where you can say we really tried we

933
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:30,950
made a best effort but we can't be

934
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:33,980
confident that this is the correct

935
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:36,230
record so sorry but we're going to have

936
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:40,280
to deny you for now here's what you can

937
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:41,960
do if you disagree with that reason any

938
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,880
data that's not clearly

939
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:46,280
associated with a confirmed identity can

940
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:49,160
also be rejected so you can do a partial

941
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:50,690
fulfillment of data if you have some

942
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,399
information that you're confident about

943
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:54,470
but then some other data that maybe

944
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,240
isn't quite associated with the correct

945
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:59,629
record leave that data out and do a

946
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:03,348
partial fulfillment instead you can also

947
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:05,480
reject impossible requests or ones that

948
00:39:03,349 --> 00:39:07,369
would require disproportionate effort I

949
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:09,260
would try to stay away from this as much

950
00:39:07,369 --> 00:39:11,470
as possible because it would potentially

951
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:13,940
be difficult to hold up in court

952
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:15,379
but this is a good one adversely

953
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:17,869
affecting the rights and freedoms of

954
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:20,510
others if data is highly correlated with

955
00:39:17,869 --> 00:39:22,250
other people or contains a lot of other

956
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:24,560
people's personal data then you might be

957
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:26,599
able to say it's it's too difficult to

958
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:29,390
extract this information and to confirm

959
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:31,460
that this is just your data sorry but

960
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:34,129
unless we get other people saying that

961
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:38,390
they want this entire set then we can't

962
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:44,380
do that also any portability requests

963
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:47,868
that are not automated or or feasible so

964
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:49,640
let's see ya portability requests that

965
00:39:47,869 --> 00:39:52,400
aren't automated or feasible you can

966
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:55,819
reject as well so this is where you

967
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:58,910
would have to send out data that has a

968
00:39:55,820 --> 00:40:00,859
machine readable format if you don't

969
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:02,660
have your applications set up to do that

970
00:40:00,859 --> 00:40:04,069
then you don't really have to fulfill

971
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:06,049
the request you don't have to write an

972
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:10,880
entirely new script so that you can

973
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:13,970
fulfill one request so what I want to

974
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:16,160
ask of all of you is to care about

975
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:19,368
privacy I know it's not something that

976
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:21,290
is really necessarily exciting in the

977
00:40:19,369 --> 00:40:23,960
way that a lot of the technical hacking

978
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:27,109
is but this is highly relevant to you

979
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:29,780
personally you don't want to spend all

980
00:40:27,109 --> 00:40:31,700
of your life trying to protect personal

981
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:33,200
data technically and then have your

982
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:35,569
lawyers just give it out to somebody

983
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,759
maliciously you know if you lose sleep

984
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:39,520
thinking about a data breach then we

985
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:42,440
should lose sleep about this one as well

986
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,970
so please remember you can have security

987
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:46,040
without privacy but you can't have

988
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:51,020
privacy without security and that means

989
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:52,609
all of you fine folks here today if you

990
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:55,250
want to see any of the sources you can

991
00:40:52,609 --> 00:40:55,910
take a photo of this slide if anybody

992
00:40:55,250 --> 00:41:11,750
has

993
00:40:55,910 --> 00:41:13,848
I can take them now yeah if the if the

994
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:24,349
rejection reasons correlate to FOIA so

995
00:41:13,849 --> 00:41:25,670
correlate to reasons I would say that

996
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:27,799
that's probably a different set of rules

997
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:31,099
so the question is can you reject a FOIA

998
00:41:27,799 --> 00:41:33,200
request for the same reasons there may

999
00:41:31,099 --> 00:41:35,930
be some relationship between them but

1000
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:38,629
FOIA isn't specific to personal data

1001
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:41,629
so there are rejection reasons for FOIA

1002
00:41:38,630 --> 00:42:13,640
or redaction usually but they would be

1003
00:41:41,630 --> 00:42:16,160
kind of different I would think so it's

1004
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:17,808
easy for it well that could be easy for

1005
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,149
an order to deny your request and yet at

1006
00:42:17,809 --> 00:42:22,099
the same time we've also seen multiple

1007
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:25,519
examples now of how easy it is for

1008
00:42:22,099 --> 00:42:27,619
person a to pose as person B and get

1009
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:30,049
their information that seems like a

1010
00:42:27,619 --> 00:42:32,509
really weird area to be in you would

1011
00:42:30,049 --> 00:42:35,240
think that orgs would be way more

1012
00:42:32,509 --> 00:42:38,690
interested in saying no because that's

1013
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:41,779
less work for them yada-yada-yada do you

1014
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:44,750
have any insight on maybe why that is r

1015
00:42:41,779 --> 00:42:47,420
is gdpr that just that fearsome of a

1016
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:50,930
beast that organizations are more

1017
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:53,029
terrified of finds to be levied against

1018
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:56,509
them there versus you know having to

1019
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:57,950
defend why they're saying no or yeah

1020
00:42:56,509 --> 00:42:59,299
that's that's a really great question

1021
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:02,720
and I think the biggest reason for that

1022
00:42:59,299 --> 00:43:04,430
is because GDP are very famously has

1023
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:07,430
that maximum four percent of your total

1024
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:08,808
global revenue fine what organizations

1025
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:09,600
don't really understand is that that's

1026
00:43:08,809 --> 00:43:11,820
not going to

1027
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:14,190
from you know accidentally denying the

1028
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:16,380
wrong request that requires some pretty

1029
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:17,880
egregious problems with your privacy

1030
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:19,440
program and it's not very likely that

1031
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:21,510
this would happen from a complaint so

1032
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:24,720
organizations are mostly just scared and

1033
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:26,040
often don't understand they also I think

1034
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,990
don't realize that there are some steps

1035
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:30,210
between getting sued for denying

1036
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:32,520
somebody and you know it doesn't just go

1037
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:35,060
immediately from denial to you like I

1038
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:50,610
have to lose four percent of my revenue

1039
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:53,730
said sati that's right yeah there's a

1040
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:55,800
lot of state state privacy laws in the

1041
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:57,570
works right now I think it's New Jersey

1042
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,340
that did the data broker law which is

1043
00:43:57,570 --> 00:44:01,770
really exciting where data brokers who

1044
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:04,860
sell your data all of those tracking

1045
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:07,530
technologies now have to disclose that

1046
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:09,870
so I think that the states are doing a

1047
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:11,850
really good job Colorado is working on

1048
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:14,850
it as well Washington

1049
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:16,650
so yeah Illinois has biometrics which is

1050
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:19,710
excellent I was very impressed with

1051
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:21,330
Illinois doing that so I do think that

1052
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:23,880
the states are doing a great job of

1053
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:25,860
advancing privacy rights I'm kind of on

1054
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:28,260
the fence about the federal law there's

1055
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:30,870
a potential for a federal law to come in

1056
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:32,880
and kind of take over and take

1057
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:34,440
precedence over state laws which could

1058
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,750
be good because it can force the other

1059
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:38,700
states to get on board but it could

1060
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:41,040
potentially weaken some of the laws so

1061
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:45,089
sees EPA would lose some of its teeth if

1062
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:59,670
a federal law took over any other

1063
00:44:45,090 --> 00:45:03,180
questions yeah oh can you can you repeat

1064
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:05,160
it I didn't catch everything with the

1065
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:07,049
work product when I write a document at

1066
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:09,000
work and I take it was metadata with my

1067
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:12,000
name and some identifying information

1068
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,590
and then later on request that back is

1069
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,500
there any type of workplace or work

1070
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:18,660
product exclusion that could be denied

1071
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:20,220
yeah so in that case um things like the

1072
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:20,970
right to be forgotten are based on

1073
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:23,040
consent

1074
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:24,959
and in that area you wouldn't be they

1075
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:27,450
wouldn't have the data on the basis of

1076
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,520
consent it would be work produced under

1077
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:33,089
contract so you don't have the right of

1078
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:34,890
data being forgotten or deleted but you

1079
00:45:33,089 --> 00:45:37,440
would potentially be able to request a

1080
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:39,299
change if the data was incorrect maybe

1081
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,890
you've changed your last name because

1082
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:47,339
you took your wife's name like you

1083
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:48,509
should and you wanted to make that

1084
00:45:47,339 --> 00:45:49,770
change you would probably be able to

1085
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:52,380
exercise that right but there are

1086
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:54,839
limitations on each of these rights that

1087
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:56,400
you do have available so it's it can be

1088
00:45:54,839 --> 00:45:58,560
a little tricky so it kind of is based

1089
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:04,310
on each case it would be quite a lot of

1090
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:04,310
time to explain each exclusion yeah

1091
00:46:06,349 --> 00:46:14,700
ochio require sure a lot of the co set

1092
00:46:11,099 --> 00:46:16,290
websites require you to send in your ID

1093
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:17,848
if you want to be forgotten by that site

1094
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:20,190
is there any way around that because it

1095
00:46:17,849 --> 00:46:23,720
feels skeevy giving somebody skeevy more

1096
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:26,849
information yeah I I would agree it is

1097
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:30,629
so I think that your best bet in that

1098
00:46:26,849 --> 00:46:32,670
case would be probably oh by the way

1099
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:35,190
there's the github and my Twitter and

1100
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:37,950
LinkedIn if you want that stuff the

1101
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:40,710
github has all of the exploits and

1102
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:42,390
defense legal text so you can go there

1103
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:46,710
and it also has the slides if you want

1104
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:49,049
the deck so I think that in this case

1105
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:51,839
you probably depending on your cut level

1106
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:53,520
of comfort with you know arguing with

1107
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:55,529
them you can talk directly to the data

1108
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:58,079
protection officer or their chief

1109
00:46:55,530 --> 00:47:00,119
privacy officer and say I disagree with

1110
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:02,520
your position on this for all of these

1111
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:04,109
reasons please explain to me why this is

1112
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:05,790
a good method of identification and

1113
00:47:04,109 --> 00:47:08,160
start the conversation that way because

1114
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:10,529
they can't just cut you off from talking

1115
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:12,299
to them you know if you have a valid

1116
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:16,790
concern then they basically have to keep

1117
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:21,359
talking to you until you're happy yeah

1118
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:24,119
any other question oh yeah yes in cases

1119
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:26,819
of social media with private messaging

1120
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:29,220
of where if a single person is a data

1121
00:47:26,819 --> 00:47:30,509
subject requests all their information

1122
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:32,609
would it be more appropriate to include

1123
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:35,819
the scope of the other half of that

1124
00:47:32,609 --> 00:47:38,009
communication that was not requested

1125
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:41,069
so kind of like in the context of a chat

1126
00:47:38,009 --> 00:47:43,229
or I am service correct so that maybe

1127
00:47:41,069 --> 00:47:45,749
person B didn't want to be a to have a

1128
00:47:43,229 --> 00:47:47,910
data export should they be given the

1129
00:47:45,749 --> 00:47:52,049
choice if person a who they were talking

1130
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:53,788
to requests it so in that case I guess

1131
00:47:52,049 --> 00:47:55,170
ultimately if you didn't want that data

1132
00:47:53,789 --> 00:47:57,839
to belong to the other person you

1133
00:47:55,170 --> 00:47:59,190
shouldn't have sent it to them you know

1134
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:01,078
or you could use a service that had

1135
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:02,400
exploding messages if you were concerned

1136
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:04,200
about it but once you've delivered

1137
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,539
something by chatter I am to another

1138
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:08,930
human then that data kind of belongs to

1139
00:48:06,539 --> 00:48:12,029
them also because it's it's joint record

1140
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:16,828
so if they can copy it then basically

1141
00:48:12,029 --> 00:48:26,430
it's their personal data now as well any

1142
00:48:16,829 --> 00:48:28,170
other questions yeah if you have a

1143
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:29,999
platform like he said at Twitter and

1144
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:31,890
you've got person a and B speaking about

1145
00:48:29,999 --> 00:48:35,129
person C through some sort of a direct

1146
00:48:31,890 --> 00:48:37,368
message and person C puts in a request

1147
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:39,119
like this would there be any

1148
00:48:37,369 --> 00:48:41,279
responsibility the platform to be able

1149
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:44,219
to track that and identify where that

1150
00:48:41,279 --> 00:48:46,559
person was being discussed okay so that

1151
00:48:44,219 --> 00:48:48,210
would go into adversely affecting the

1152
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:50,279
rights and freedoms of others it's my

1153
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:51,690
right to you know say do you remember

1154
00:48:50,279 --> 00:48:55,109
that guy who asked that question today

1155
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:58,589
and talked about you if I want to I get

1156
00:48:55,109 --> 00:49:00,960
to do that so it would be an invasion of

1157
00:48:58,589 --> 00:49:02,569
those people's privacy to go in and find

1158
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:06,229
out everything that they said about you

1159
00:49:02,569 --> 00:49:08,819
so that's also it's protective for that

1160
00:49:06,229 --> 00:49:10,109
intimate partner stalking and harassment

1161
00:49:08,819 --> 00:49:11,369
as well because you don't want to give

1162
00:49:10,109 --> 00:49:14,640
somebody the opportunity to just

1163
00:49:11,369 --> 00:49:16,619
basically you know read everything that

1164
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,180
was ever said about them so you would be

1165
00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:20,009
able to turn that down it doesn't just

1166
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:21,180
because your name is mentioned somewhere

1167
00:49:20,009 --> 00:49:23,400
it doesn't necessarily mean that

1168
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:26,700
personal data kind of belongs to you

1169
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:28,170
especially where you there is actually a

1170
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:32,129
difference between data that you

1171
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:35,460
provided to an organization or data that

1172
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:37,049
they got in some other way so it's it's

1173
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:40,559
a little nuanced but yeah they wouldn't

1174
00:49:37,049 --> 00:49:46,250
be able to get that any other questions

1175
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:49,640
no oh

1176
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:51,230
hey well in that case I will be outside

1177
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:53,060
if you want to talk

1178
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:54,710
additionaly about any other questions

1179
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:57,070
that you have and thank you so much for

1180
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:57,070
