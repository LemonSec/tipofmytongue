1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,830
all right

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:05,830
[Music]

3
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:15,670
it's better if I'm not that particularly

4
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:15,670
sharp focus all right

5
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:24,380
that's that no whatever I just rather be

6
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:28,250
closer to the this is a better group

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:30,520
dynamic are we good we live all right

8
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:33,920
good morning everyone thanks for coming

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:35,780
we did a little you know schedule change

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,660
at the last minute because Chris Robert

11
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:41,270
had Roberts had some flight delay this

12
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:42,980
morning he is on his way and he's

13
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:46,870
promising to stop at a liquor store

14
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:49,129
because he owes me but I I took his slot

15
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:50,900
name of the talk is more Tales from the

16
00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:53,059
Crypt analyst my name is Jeff man

17
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:55,489
there's my contact information if you're

18
00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:58,790
interested I repeated at the end if

19
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:59,780
you're still interested I got a lot to

20
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:03,019
get through this morning

21
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:06,409
so I'm going to apologetically talk very

22
00:01:03,019 --> 00:01:08,030
quickly just very quickly I work for a

23
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:09,860
company called online business systems

24
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:11,690
they pay my way to come out here and

25
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,490
speak at conferences so I like to give

26
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:16,490
them a nod because they're very

27
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:18,500
appreciative of me doing this and I'm

28
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:20,658
very appreciative of them letting me so

29
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,829
please give online a quick round of

30
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:26,659
applause if you would please thank you

31
00:01:23,829 --> 00:01:28,758
we do consulting we do security

32
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:30,590
consulting in the compliance field we

33
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:33,829
have security testers we have managed

34
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:36,200
security services we're always hiring if

35
00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:38,089
anybody's interested I'm happy to pass

36
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,850
your name along it's all I'll say about

37
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:43,310
them I've been in the information

38
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:46,339
security field for about 37 years this

39
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:48,740
is my background a good chunk of that my

40
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,539
formative years were at NSA the National

41
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:53,658
Security Agency which is kind of what

42
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:55,999
this talks about today I do want to

43
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:57,950
apologize because as I was putting this

44
00:01:55,999 --> 00:01:59,449
talk together and trying to make it

45
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:02,929
interesting and trying to find cool

46
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:05,530
screenshots for you know the slides I

47
00:02:02,929 --> 00:02:07,869
realize you know back in the day

48
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:10,090
we're going back into the mid early to

49
00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:13,120
mid 90s this is how we took screenshot

50
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:16,360
so please bear with me if the graphics

51
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,930
aren't up to the usual caliber of AK on

52
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:22,300
top I'm gonna try to involve you guys

53
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,709
today and interject some important dates

54
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,900
in history this is a little bit of

55
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:28,420
audience feedback audience participation

56
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,280
we're gonna try it out real quickly add

57
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:32,799
eight flashes on the screen you get to

58
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,200
shout out why this data is important in

59
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,060
history anyone know anyone have any idea

60
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,440
I'm not gonna give you a whole lot of

61
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:44,950
time to think because I got a lot of

62
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:48,040
slides go through give up wait for the

63
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:51,720
laugh track alright another thing I'm

64
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:54,489
throwing in this talk today because I

65
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,989
had this idea a couple weeks ago and I

66
00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:59,430
knew Circle City comm was going to be

67
00:02:55,989 --> 00:03:01,750
doing the the mental health hackers here

68
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,700
something that's really important I'm

69
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:06,250
sure we've all known people that have

70
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:10,359
had struggles in this industry some very

71
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:12,400
severely and some very permanently so I

72
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:15,430
wanted to as I was going through this

73
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,750
talk I'm going to interject and I don't

74
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:19,299
know when because I threw in the slides

75
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:21,010
yesterday and I'm not I don't have my my

76
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:22,810
crux of seeing what the next slide is

77
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:24,399
but there's gonna be some occasional

78
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:29,739
slides when they pop up I'll tell you

79
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:31,900
why so just be on the lookout the the

80
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:33,940
nature of this talk originally there was

81
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,100
a Tales from the Crypt analyst talk and

82
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:40,780
is this is all about the ten years that

83
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:43,540
I spent at NSA from 1986 to 1996 while I

84
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:45,040
was there primarily or the good chunk of

85
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:47,078
the time I was a Crypt analyst a

86
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,140
cryptographer I actually worked on both

87
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:52,780
sides offense and defense as it were and

88
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:55,268
also got into which is the crux of this

89
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:58,480
talk doing security testing penetration

90
00:03:55,269 --> 00:04:00,340
testing vulnerability assessments the

91
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,170
original talk Tales from the Crypt I

92
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,540
went through the first several years of

93
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:06,850
my career and I sort of had three

94
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:11,560
different careers at NSA three different

95
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:14,799
duty stations if you will very quickly

96
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,298
the first couple years at NSA just a

97
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,660
recap in case you haven't seen the

98
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:20,149
original

99
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:21,890
I was a cryptographer on the InfoSec

100
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:23,840
side of the house working in the manual

101
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:28,010
cryptosystems branch we produced paper

102
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:32,450
products primarily one-time pads one of

103
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:35,230
my customers very early on asked me hey

104
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:37,700
it takes us hours to write out these

105
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:39,650
messages encrypting them and decrypting

106
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,120
them with a one-time pad but we've got

107
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:43,460
this computer sitting on the desk

108
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,140
couldn't we use that to do the

109
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:47,210
encryption decryption and I thought sure

110
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:49,250
why not that seems reasonable it's not a

111
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:52,729
complicated algorithm you just need to

112
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:54,800
have the key so I ended up producing

113
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:56,990
what to my knowledge is the first

114
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,230
software base crypto system that NSA

115
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:04,190
produced which was no small feat and I

116
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:06,919
share that because at NSA at the time in

117
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:08,930
the InfoSec InfoSec was responsible at

118
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:11,510
NSA for producing all the cryptic Africa

119
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:13,640
quipment that that was used by the US

120
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:16,909
the military the you know the government

121
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:18,740
and it was all boxes it was all hardware

122
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:20,960
in fact I had a chief scientist say to

123
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:24,620
me one time there's no such thing as

124
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,510
software it's really all hardware so in

125
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:28,130
you know thinking about this talk which

126
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:30,919
ultimately is about the beginning of

127
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:33,440
hacking and pen testing at NSA I thought

128
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:35,450
back to this incident and I thought you

129
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,979
know I didn't think about it at the time

130
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:39,020
but I was really hack in the system

131
00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:41,090
because I had to take requirement specs

132
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,590
that were written for hardware and sort

133
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:45,739
of jerry-rigged them and rewrite them to

134
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:47,469
make them make sense for software so I

135
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:50,180
was sort of one of my formative

136
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:53,150
experiences early on I also had a

137
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:55,160
customer that used a one-time pad with

138
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:58,370
the the algorithm that they used for

139
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:00,080
encryption and decryption was 26 offsets

140
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,550
of the alphabet reversed that's called a

141
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,760
visionnaire table or a Visionnaire

142
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:06,830
square they memorized the algorithm

143
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:09,229
which the the table actually produces

144
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:11,000
unique three letter combinations I did

145
00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:15,469
not have them memorized so I just made

146
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:18,250
this little simple aid to help me do the

147
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:20,750
encryption and decryption process and

148
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:24,500
they liked it so much we ended up making

149
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:26,810
like 15,000 of them I gave this talk a

150
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:29,060
little while ago with cypher con and a

151
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:30,680
friend of mine came up to me who happens

152
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,360
to be in the room I don't I don't know

153
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,970
William if I should say your name or not

154
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:37,070
but he asked me have you ever heard

155
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:38,810
about this Diana cryptosystem that the

156
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:40,760
Special Forces used and I'm like well

157
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,980
that name doesn't sound familiar to me

158
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,320
but I googled it and I found this site

159
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:49,700
and I thought to myself gee that looks

160
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:51,230
really familiar and and you know I told

161
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:54,289
William I said you know I'm the guy that

162
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:55,790
invented it so long story short I got in

163
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:59,720
touch with this guy that was making

164
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:03,229
these wooden versions of my visionnaire

165
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:05,720
wheel and he was so happy to hear about

166
00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:07,340
you know hear from the inventor and hear

167
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,410
the real story about how it came about

168
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:12,260
he sent me a bunch of these wooden

169
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:14,000
crypto puzzles you can go on Etsy and

170
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,800
find this guy they're really cool

171
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
puzzles I forgot to put them in my bag

172
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,010
otherwise I would have shared them with

173
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,830
you but we had a really good

174
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:23,150
conversation via email my ultimate goal

175
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:24,620
is I want to make sure that this gets

176
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:26,840
into the National Cryptologic Museum

177
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:28,040
because there's not a lot of InfoSec

178
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,489
history at the National Cryptologic

179
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:33,650
Museum and as far as I know the Special

180
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:35,780
Forces use these wheels for about 10

181
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:37,370
years at least 10 years so they

182
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:40,309
remembered it and somebody thought it

183
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:43,070
should be memorialized in wood so why

184
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:44,570
not put it in the museum that's actually

185
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:47,510
a picture of one of the production

186
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:49,070
models I have a prototype I have it in

187
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:51,050
my bag if anybody wants to see it I

188
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:52,310
carry it with me wherever I go because

189
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:56,450
you never know when you need to encrypt

190
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:58,490
with a one-time pad one of my early

191
00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:00,500
bosses he called me a loose cannon

192
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:03,010
looking back on it's like yeah I had the

193
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:05,810
hacker mentality even before I knew it

194
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:07,719
my second career I became a crypt

195
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:09,430
analysis intern and

196
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,750
one over work on the operation side of

197
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:12,490
the house and I happened to be there

198
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:15,000
during the first Gulf encounter which

199
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:17,320
was called Desert Shield Desert Storm

200
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,430
so not a whole lot on that but that's

201
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:23,800
just a quick recap of what I did in my

202
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:27,070
early days of the my formative years at

203
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:29,980
NSA ultimately I was certified as a

204
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:33,900
Crypt analyst at NSA that's really the

205
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:36,940
only certification I carry to this day

206
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:38,978
which leads me into the crux of this

207
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:42,700
talk which is the last chapter of my

208
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:45,280
time at NSA which started as my last

209
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:47,830
tour as an intern I went back to InfoSec

210
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:50,709
and I ended up working for an office

211
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:52,630
called fielded systems evaluation field

212
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,980
those field and systems evaluations was

213
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:57,520
interesting because somebody had the

214
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:59,260
brilliant idea that you know NSA had a

215
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,510
reputation for producing all the crypto

216
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:03,010
and we produced the best crypto the best

217
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:04,660
little black boxes in the world they

218
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:07,150
were unbreakable they were perfect

219
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,680
everything worked fine but somebody

220
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:10,990
realized well the way that we were very

221
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:13,239
often successful on the operations side

222
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:15,610
of the house was we were able to read

223
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,740
communications from adversaries and from

224
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:20,320
foreign countries because the people

225
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:22,330
that used them did silly things like

226
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,700
they didn't change default settings or

227
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:27,220
they found bypasses around the crypto or

228
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:30,010
even something like a one-time pad which

229
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:33,070
if as the name implies you use the key

230
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:35,439
one time but for you know conservation

231
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:37,390
efforts or whatever reason every once in

232
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,880
a while somebody might use a page of key

233
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:41,770
you know maybe for a day maybe for a

234
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,689
week maybe for a month I guess they

235
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:45,699
thought they were saving paper when you

236
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:47,670
do that you introduce vulnerabilities

237
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:50,260
which makes the underlying message

238
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:52,599
ultimately solvable that's a lot of what

239
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:54,700
cryptanalysis is so somebody had the

240
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,589
idea of well gee if we're doing it to

241
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:58,510
them how do we know they're not doing it

242
00:09:56,589 --> 00:10:01,270
to us so there was this whole office

243
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:03,310
that was looking at how our systems were

244
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:05,770
being used in the field so it was a lot

245
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:08,020
of observation you know looking at the

246
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:11,680
the way that 18 19 20 year-old

247
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:14,680
communications come kamo soldiers were

248
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,449
using the things in the field this is

249
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,500
one of the devices that I was actually

250
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:21,040
working on

251
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:22,420
from an evaluation perspective not that

252
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,810
that's a big deal but that's really what

253
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:27,579
I was working on Oh another date this is

254
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:32,069
a date that changed history anybody have

255
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:35,950
an idea what it is when once going twice

256
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:40,270
flipper chip no this is the day that

257
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:42,520
gave us all our occupation the day that

258
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:45,550
the internet became popular in public

259
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:48,730
the day that mosaic came out and that's

260
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:50,740
actual I know this is that screenshot

261
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:52,420
thing that's actually what the first

262
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:55,030
mosaic browser looked like anybody

263
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:59,620
remember this thing few people you're

264
00:10:55,030 --> 00:11:01,209
all you're old like me so and then you

265
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:04,690
know as soon as the internet became

266
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:05,950
popular what came along hackers people

267
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:08,290
who were trying to figure out how to

268
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:10,840
break it people that were figuring out

269
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:14,800
how to use the hidden features and not

270
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:16,270
so hidden features back in those days I

271
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,270
think it was interesting and it's

272
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:21,430
interesting to me at least in the early

273
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:23,620
days we called it Internet security

274
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:26,680
nowadays we call it that ugly c-word

275
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:29,410
that a lot of us don't like but in the

276
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:31,530
beginning the idea was organizations

277
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:34,480
primarily governments and research for

278
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:36,040
universities and military contractors

279
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,760
that's who was using the internet back

280
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:41,740
then you know they were talking amongst

281
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,020
themselves but it wasn't terribly public

282
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:46,000
but when the public when the general

283
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:47,410
masses came on board the belief was well

284
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,570
everybody's got networks and computers

285
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:51,010
already all we have to do is protect it

286
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:53,400
from the evil internet so it was all

287
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:55,960
about creating a barrier creating a

288
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:58,660
perimeter and you know much like

289
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:03,730
military tactics if we just build a wall

290
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:06,310
like a firewall we'll be safe oh here's

291
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:08,440
one of these insertions I want to just

292
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:11,109
interject while I'm going through this

293
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,970
talk I asked my wife to she does

294
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:14,980
scrapbooking and does a lot of photo

295
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:17,200
albums which I'm very grateful for but I

296
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:19,990
want to just interject while I was doing

297
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,820
all this stuff at NSA I also had a life

298
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:23,590
one of the benefits of working for the

299
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:26,590
government was both mostly had a

300
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:30,370
nine-to-five job so you know while I was

301
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:30,850
getting into fielded systems evaluations

302
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:34,620
and all

303
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:37,839
getting into hacking at NSA I was also

304
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:40,240
married buying a house raising children

305
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,399
so these are just some shots you know

306
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,370
I'm in here first and foremost I'm a dad

307
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,319
I'm a husband I have a family

308
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:50,800
that's me with hair and me without a

309
00:12:47,319 --> 00:12:52,389
beard and and back in the early days I

310
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,310
grew my hair long what was left of it

311
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:55,420
and that's almost like a mullet and

312
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:59,079
probably shouldn't have put that picture

313
00:12:55,420 --> 00:13:00,969
up there I'm sorry there anyway there

314
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:02,859
was a small group of us in this office

315
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:04,750
doing fielded systems evaluations that

316
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:08,829
started focusing on what we called it

317
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:12,339
the time networked systems and one of

318
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:14,680
our great inspirations was a book that

319
00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:16,420
was out at the time called the Cuckoo's

320
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,099
egg anybody ever read the book heard the

321
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:20,050
book heard of the book if you haven't

322
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:23,259
read it I encourage you to find it and

323
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:24,758
get a copy it's a story of this guy and

324
00:13:23,259 --> 00:13:28,779
this actually happened you know cliff

325
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:30,279
stalls his name in 1986 he actually

326
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:32,680
discovered I'll make a long story short

327
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:35,230
no spoilers but he he was working for a

328
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:37,870
university and figured out that bad guys

329
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:39,639
had broken into the university systems

330
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:42,009
to steal government secrets and he was

331
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:44,670
able to track them down and figure out

332
00:13:42,009 --> 00:13:46,600
and find them and they were ultimately

333
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,829
exposed I figured whether they were

334
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,430
prosecuted or not because they were

335
00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:54,040
spies after all

336
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:56,109
I bring this up because this really was

337
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,969
a motivation and also because just a

338
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:00,160
little while ago I actually got to meet

339
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:03,939
cliff Stoll I was at a conference in

340
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:06,130
Halifax Nova Scotia and he's as zany as

341
00:14:03,939 --> 00:14:11,649
he comes across if you've ever seen

342
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:14,110
videos of them or seen him live but it

343
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:15,939
was a fanboy moment for me you know one

344
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:19,529
of my early inspirations I actually got

345
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:25,149
to meet and we got to hang out anyway

346
00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:27,550
back back at NSA management got ahold of

347
00:14:25,149 --> 00:14:28,930
things and started learning well you

348
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:30,849
know there's this thing going on called

349
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:33,310
hacking and computer security and

350
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:35,470
internet security and what the

351
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:37,689
government likes to do very often is

352
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:39,399
reorganized so they reorganized and they

353
00:14:37,689 --> 00:14:41,050
formed an organization that was called

354
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:42,480
the systems and network attack center

355
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:44,670
and I became a part of that

356
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,390
we were designed to be Chris made it

357
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:49,680
Chris made it if I say hi Chris

358
00:14:47,390 --> 00:15:01,830
there's cups in the back and I am

359
00:14:49,680 --> 00:15:03,900
thirsty proper please so this this

360
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:06,630
organization was organized as the center

361
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:08,699
of excellence and and it was designed to

362
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:10,530
be you know because the government has

363
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:12,600
to management has to put their fingers

364
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:14,280
on it we were going to go real deep

365
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,900
where that we're the best in the world

366
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,160
of crypto were in the best of the world

367
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,660
at everything else so we might as well

368
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:21,060
be the best of the world at doing all

369
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:24,000
this computer security internet type of

370
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:26,459
security stuff there was a group of us

371
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,750
that we got together and we said we're

372
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:29,070
gonna we're gonna learn how to hack

373
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,300
we're gonna learn how to break into

374
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:34,070
systems we're gonna learn how to break

375
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:36,150
into networks and it's all sorts of fun

376
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:37,560
management had a different vision they

377
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:39,449
just figured all we need is a bunch of

378
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,189
these you know smart guys who'd be

379
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:43,740
better than the whole world well you

380
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:45,870
know I don't care how good you are if

381
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,490
you get 10 20 50 people together you're

382
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,990
not going to compete against the world

383
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:51,120
where there's hundreds and thousands of

384
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:56,670
people's out there doing all this stuff

385
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:58,230
and that's proven true I think but this

386
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:01,110
was sort of the mentality that we were

387
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:07,230
up against from the very beginning here

388
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:09,420
thank you that's great thank you this is

389
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:13,790
why you should always pay it forward and

390
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:16,439
and and occupy time slots in a pinch I

391
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:20,790
don't even really care if I finished my

392
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:22,380
talk now but you did so there's a small

393
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:25,170
group of us who've got together at the

394
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:27,480
time the organization that sort of owned

395
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:29,490
the internet or owned the network for

396
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,670
the for the DoD was the Air Force they

397
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:34,680
they were responsible for making it run

398
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:37,530
and they were the first group that put

399
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:39,089
together what was you know a Security

400
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:40,530
Operations Center a sock they were the

401
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:42,690
first ones that started getting into

402
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:44,160
like you know how do you detect bad

403
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:47,070
things that are happening on the network

404
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,510
so we decided you know learn from them

405
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:50,610
we wanted to see what they were doing

406
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:52,590
get set up so we took a road trip we

407
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,699
went to meet some of these guys these

408
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:59,249
are some of our early

409
00:16:53,699 --> 00:17:01,229
Mentors I'll just have to tell you their

410
00:16:59,249 --> 00:17:04,139
names the person on the left

411
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:06,209
captain's ice he unfortunately passed

412
00:17:04,138 --> 00:17:08,158
away about two years ago and on the

413
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:09,630
right Captain Waddell I actually had a

414
00:17:08,159 --> 00:17:12,179
chance to talk to him as I was putting

415
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:14,130
this talk together we reminisced over

416
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:16,439
all the times they were putting together

417
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:18,360
what was essentially the first sock and

418
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:20,850
like many government employees did back

419
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:23,359
in the day they went out and formed a

420
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:26,099
company anybody ever hear the will group

421
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:30,360
they lasted all of about what 18 months

422
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:33,149
and they they were quickly acquired by a

423
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:34,590
company that is known neo world over as

424
00:17:33,149 --> 00:17:38,658
being a security company anybody know

425
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:42,149
what company acquired them Cisco

426
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:43,919
trivia that's all on full o so we took a

427
00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:45,779
trip they were down in San Antonio we

428
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,700
took a trip to San Antonio they were at

429
00:17:45,779 --> 00:17:49,740
an Air Force Base so we got to see cool

430
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:52,169
sights because we were vacationing a

431
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:54,179
little bit it was a boondoggle those are

432
00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:58,289
actually some of the guys that I worked

433
00:17:54,179 --> 00:18:00,210
with there the sr-71 spy plane that had

434
00:17:58,289 --> 00:18:01,769
only been recently Declassified so I was

435
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:05,159
the first time we got to see one for

436
00:18:01,769 --> 00:18:07,289
real that plane was primarily

437
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:09,149
responsible for winning Desert Storm so

438
00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:11,340
quickly the I think it's the a-10

439
00:18:09,149 --> 00:18:14,370
warthog of course we saw the sights we

440
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:16,289
saw the Alamo San Antonio is a really

441
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:18,750
cool Riverwalk and if you go to the

442
00:18:16,289 --> 00:18:22,169
Riverwalk and this is very important in

443
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:26,429
hacker lore we discovered the 46 ounce

444
00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:28,289
margarita and I recommend if you are

445
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:30,179
going to do any kind of security testing

446
00:18:28,289 --> 00:18:32,070
penetration testing hacking whatever we

447
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:37,049
call this stuff obviously alcohol is

448
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:39,299
involved another excursion I took I took

449
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:42,090
vacations with my family it wasn't all

450
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:44,360
work I put this particular slide here

451
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:47,070
because I remember being in San Antonio

452
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:49,709
calling my wife to see how she was doing

453
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:52,559
because I had just finished like a 25

454
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:55,230
ounce steak dinner and then was drinking

455
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,970
this forty six ounce margarita and she

456
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:58,830
was telling me about how she had like

457
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:01,740
split a can of tuna with her and the

458
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:03,449
four kids and I'm like wow it's I'll

459
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,770
make sure I'll take you on a vacation so

460
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:07,650
work-life balance I

461
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:09,150
always do it well but I always tried to

462
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:13,350
make up for it

463
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:15,600
so remember work-life balance our

464
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:18,240
biggest takeaway what we took you know

465
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,590
other than you know smart guys the you

466
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,590
know we kind of knew what they did in

467
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:23,879
terms of the technical methodologies and

468
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:25,949
things like that what we had learned at

469
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,960
the time but they had an office

470
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:29,700
structure that wasn't just cubicle after

471
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,040
cubicle they had pushed their cubicles

472
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,680
to the corners and literally had a

473
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:37,800
roundtable so we've recreated that in

474
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:39,600
our new office in the snack and the idea

475
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:42,090
was if anybody was working on a project

476
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,490
and had a question or had a problem and

477
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:46,379
they needed help they would simply any a

478
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:48,150
lot of us could simply call round table

479
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:50,100
we all drop what we were doing literally

480
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:51,870
just spin our chairs come to the middle

481
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,580
and we'd collaborate and try to figure

482
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:56,399
out the problem it was a great way to

483
00:19:53,580 --> 00:20:00,149
work collaboratively back in the days

484
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:02,580
when people worked in offices we very

485
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:04,800
quickly realized that we didn't fit in

486
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:07,470
with everybody else we tried to create

487
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:09,060
our own space and our own personalities

488
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:12,450
we were trying to live the hacker

489
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:15,120
methodology excuse me men they occurred

490
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:18,390
to me I should actually drink this

491
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:21,929
and this is sort of the story of what

492
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:23,940
came to be known as the pit we as part

493
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:25,470
of the reorganization we moved locations

494
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:27,650
these are office buildings that are just

495
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:31,320
outside just west of BWI Airport

496
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:33,630
Maryland and when we moved into our

497
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,820
office part of the part of like the

498
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:37,920
living the hacker culture was we decided

499
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:40,139
to give our office a nickname and we

500
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:42,780
called it the pit and the pit was simply

501
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:44,880
what we called our office it was located

502
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:46,740
in this particular building in that

503
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,450
particular corner and I forget I think

504
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:51,030
was on the second or third floor it's

505
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:55,470
been a few years you can drive by these

506
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:57,120
buildings today they still exist why I

507
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:58,950
bring this up is a couple years ago a

508
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,209
book came out called dark territories

509
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:03,690
anybody read this book heard of this

510
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:06,150
book recommended reading in this book

511
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:09,750
there was a chapter called eligible

512
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:13,190
receiver which I'll get to later what

513
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:14,390
what the title means and in that chapter

514
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:17,060
one

515
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:19,250
members of the pit got the book and read

516
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:22,429
it and then emailed all of us and said

517
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:24,620
hey we're in a book so I like to do it

518
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:27,470
as a dramatic reading for you but in the

519
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:30,500
middle it's it says during its most

520
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:33,200
sensitive drills the red team worked out

521
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:36,140
of a chamber called the pit which was so

522
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,600
secret that few people at NSA knew it

523
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:40,810
existed and even they couldn't enter

524
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:43,760
without first passing through to

525
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:47,030
combination locked doors well that was

526
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,710
very impressive and kind of accurate we

527
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:51,560
did work in an office we called it the

528
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:52,760
pit and it didn't have to lock the doors

529
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,399
though I don't know where that came from

530
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:58,360
but apparently somehow my humble

531
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:00,770
beginnings as a hacker pen tester at NSA

532
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,969
somehow grew into folklore that made it

533
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:03,740
into a book so that should be

534
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:08,330
everybody's aspiration is to make it

535
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:09,920
into a book someday and the pit although

536
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:11,870
that's what we called our office it was

537
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,760
really six guys and we were all just

538
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:15,370
trying to figure out the stuff that

539
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,930
we're still trying to figure out today

540
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:20,209
it was just a group of guys that were

541
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:22,010
trying to be hackers and trying to make

542
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:24,860
the world better by breaking into things

543
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:29,840
and telling our customers how to prevent

544
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:31,399
the bad guys from breaking in one thing

545
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,990
that we discovered though was nobody

546
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:36,500
ever really done this before in an

547
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:39,140
organized fashion so there wasn't sans

548
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:40,970
courses to take there weren't sans

549
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:45,860
instructors in the room listening to you

550
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:49,000
give this talk so we had to kind of

551
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:52,360
figure things out for our own selves and

552
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:55,400
so we had to come up with methodologies

553
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:57,290
but while we were doing that of course

554
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,240
we still had management oversight and

555
00:22:57,290 --> 00:23:01,810
management sometimes had different ideas

556
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:04,940
which that's what management has to do

557
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:07,970
and they had some concerns and there was

558
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:11,120
sort of two primary concerns well one

559
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:12,950
that came more of an issue later on but

560
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:16,389
it's simply you know the whole issue

561
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:18,370
that NSA does what NSA does to foreign

562
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:22,210
countries and and

563
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:24,939
and persons and not US citizens the

564
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:26,950
other one was more political in nature

565
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:28,780
of NSA had never done something like

566
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:30,640
this before

567
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:34,629
you know it was new and different and

568
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,920
maybe some of the managers you know well

569
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:37,720
you know hacking was just kind of

570
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,340
mysterious and they didn't understand it

571
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:42,130
so that they they wanted us to follow

572
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:46,179
rules and in a bureaucracy rules are

573
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:48,520
time-consuming and and and and so one of

574
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:50,380
the biggest problems was if we wanted to

575
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:53,110
do some sort of a test against a target

576
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:56,050
against a customer we had to go through

577
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:58,240
all sorts of bureaucratic permission

578
00:23:56,050 --> 00:24:00,190
gathering which back in those days was

579
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,860
done on paper and so paper had to pass

580
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:04,510
from desk to desk to desk secretary to

581
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:07,120
manager secretary to manager and it

582
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:09,010
would often literally take a month for

583
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:12,159
us to get permission to do what it was

584
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:14,140
that we were itching to do and to be

585
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,790
quite honest honest might have already

586
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:17,110
done that nobody knew it because there

587
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:21,700
was no such thing as intrusion detection

588
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:23,620
back then anyway we came up with

589
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:25,330
methodologies you know we started out by

590
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:27,010
doing reconnaissance we wanted to know

591
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:29,649
our target we wanted to figure out what

592
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:33,100
we had to work with what was out there

593
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:35,230
we caught a recon these days you might

594
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:36,550
be more familiar with the term Osen or

595
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:39,820
open source intelligence it's

596
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:42,040
essentially the same thing we would do

597
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:45,460
our initial discovery doing some sort of

598
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:46,809
network probing and find out the targets

599
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:48,610
find out what they were you know what

600
00:24:46,809 --> 00:24:50,770
ports and services they were talking on

601
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:52,330
things like that what kind of you know

602
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:54,490
if it was on a network you know we'd

603
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:56,649
find out trust relationships find out

604
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:58,300
basically whatever we could find in

605
00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:00,640
terms of what our target was so we could

606
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:03,899
develop an attack strategy and then

607
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:07,600
execute the TAC and have lots of fun and

608
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:09,370
you know get giddy when we got root or

609
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,040
to use the vernacular of the day Poppa

610
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:15,699
shell and then we report our findings

611
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:17,409
and move on hasn't really changed a

612
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:19,120
whole lot today somebody I mean you

613
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:19,500
teach the methodology is it changed a

614
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,110
whole lot

615
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:24,730
not a whole lot I mean we didn't invent

616
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:26,439
it we just you know there's a right way

617
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:27,590
to do it and there's a methodical way to

618
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,419
do it and

619
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:31,668
it hadn't been written down at that time

620
00:25:29,419 --> 00:25:34,580
so we just kinda had to come up with it

621
00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:36,500
on our own what I want to impress upon

622
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:38,059
you too though and this is a little bit

623
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,440
of a history lesson is we didn't have

624
00:25:38,059 --> 00:25:42,168
all the tools that you guys have

625
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:46,039
available today all these things didn't

626
00:25:42,169 --> 00:25:48,500
exist or we didn't have access to even

627
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:50,360
something is fundamental as nmap and I

628
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:52,220
had to stop and check myself when I was

629
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:54,709
putting together this talk to find out

630
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:58,490
when did nmap come out and it came out

631
00:25:54,710 --> 00:26:01,070
after I had left NSA another

632
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:04,400
interjection you know while we're having

633
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:06,590
fun working I still went home and got

634
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,600
involved in family activities and

635
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:12,350
carving pumpkins and all that kind of

636
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:16,820
stuff those are my kids they're all

637
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:18,590
grown up now I want to share with you a

638
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:20,059
little bit about what you know I've told

639
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:21,230
you what we didn't have now I want to

640
00:26:20,059 --> 00:26:23,570
share a little bit about what we did

641
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:28,460
have in terms of our tradecraft and I do

642
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:31,158
have to give a disclaimer here an

643
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:34,400
additional burden that we had or

644
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:37,400
challenge that we had is the way NSA

645
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:40,520
rules work rules worked was if we were

646
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:44,750
targeting a system anything that we did

647
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:46,908
to that system no matter how benign had

648
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:50,659
to be classified at the level of the

649
00:26:46,909 --> 00:26:53,059
system that we were targeting so in

650
00:26:50,659 --> 00:26:56,210
trying to tell you what stuff we were

651
00:26:53,059 --> 00:26:58,059
using back then what I will say is I'm

652
00:26:56,210 --> 00:27:00,440
not going to tell you what we were using

653
00:26:58,059 --> 00:27:02,240
necessarily I'm gonna tell you what was

654
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:06,919
commonly available at the time

655
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:08,720
nudge-nudge wink-wink with me all right

656
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:13,580
so we had these things called Network

657
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:16,130
sniffers they were appliances they were

658
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:17,629
hardware they weighed 2030 pounds we

659
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:20,510
would roll them around on a cart and

660
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:22,130
plug them into a network prior to

661
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:24,169
Ethernet there was other types of

662
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:27,289
network cables and we had that had the

663
00:27:24,169 --> 00:27:30,770
right attachments they were quite

664
00:27:27,289 --> 00:27:34,870
cumbersome but they were quite useful we

665
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:37,549
had available to us at some point early

666
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:39,549
vulnerability scanning tools Satan being

667
00:27:37,549 --> 00:27:43,029
one of the first ones anybody remembers

668
00:27:39,549 --> 00:27:46,059
Satan Satan is actually still out there

669
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:47,860
somewhere I should put the Euro URL up

670
00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:49,029
on this sometime you can download it I

671
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:50,678
don't know if you can get it to run on

672
00:27:49,029 --> 00:27:52,809
anything because it's yeah actually

673
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:56,249
compile the code does anybody do that

674
00:27:52,809 --> 00:27:58,779
anymore I don't know but it's out there

675
00:27:56,249 --> 00:28:00,879
one of the things I do as an aside is

676
00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:02,529
I'm a host on security weekly in case

677
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:05,408
you didn't know that we had a chance to

678
00:28:02,529 --> 00:28:07,659
interview the authors of Satan last I

679
00:28:05,409 --> 00:28:08,799
think was last November or December does

680
00:28:07,659 --> 00:28:10,570
it say there

681
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:13,600
you can look it up on YouTube it's

682
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:15,399
episode 584 another I've had a lot of

683
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,629
fanboy moments in the last year this was

684
00:28:15,399 --> 00:28:18,129
another one of them because I got to

685
00:28:16,629 --> 00:28:19,600
meet the guys that wrote Satan you know

686
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:21,998
they're like that's the original tool

687
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,559
that we got to use great guys great

688
00:28:21,999 --> 00:28:25,720
conversation I think that's one of our

689
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:30,039
best interviews that we've done oh

690
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:32,919
another date anyone I've been I've been

691
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:36,850
stumping everyone so far something

692
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:38,980
called bug track came out in 1993 it's

693
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:41,498
that old it was later taken over by

694
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:43,809
Aleph one in 1996 but it's been around

695
00:28:41,499 --> 00:28:52,389
since 1993 how many years of that 26

696
00:28:43,809 --> 00:28:54,668
years Netscape bugs so some of you might

697
00:28:52,389 --> 00:28:58,269
be asking what is bug track and we'll

698
00:28:54,669 --> 00:28:59,940
get to that right after we take a dip in

699
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:02,889
the pool

700
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:06,690
remember work-life balance don't always

701
00:29:02,889 --> 00:29:06,689
have take time out to have a life

702
00:29:06,869 --> 00:29:12,580
another this is an example of bug track

703
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:15,249
what bug track was was a way to report

704
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:17,080
vulnerabilities and issues with software

705
00:29:15,249 --> 00:29:19,029
and code and hardware and whatever you

706
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:22,449
were dealing with and it was done pretty

707
00:29:19,029 --> 00:29:23,769
much by a mailing list email there used

708
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:27,519
to be this thing called email that

709
00:29:23,769 --> 00:29:29,320
people would communicate with and so you

710
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:30,580
know you would write a question send it

711
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:33,279
to the group and hopefully somebody

712
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:35,259
would be familiar with the problem and

713
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:37,989
could answer you know give you guidance

714
00:29:35,259 --> 00:29:39,039
or they might be interested and do some

715
00:29:37,989 --> 00:29:42,190
research and you could work

716
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:45,908
collaboratively and in the very

717
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:48,100
beginning I don't remember that it was

718
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:49,420
very particularly searchable but people

719
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,159
would gather all the bugs

720
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:53,500
data and eventually put it into

721
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:55,060
searchable databases where you could you

722
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,160
know if you wanted to investigate a

723
00:29:55,060 --> 00:30:01,810
particular topic or a particular system

724
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:03,520
or application you can do that there was

725
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:05,830
also organizations that would public

726
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:08,460
advisories if they saw hacker activity

727
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:11,050
bad guy activity they'd report about

728
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:13,150
computer emergency response teams I

729
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:14,560
don't know if you can read that if you

730
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:16,900
get down there there should be a chuckle

731
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:19,080
at some point this is a bonafide sir

732
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:25,090
divisor that was released in July 4th

733
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:28,960
1996 1999 1996 it's kicking in and it's

734
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:32,290
all about malware that could affect

735
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:34,120
alien spaceships which is the plot of

736
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:37,330
you know how we won the day in

737
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:39,969
Independence Day so back then certs had

738
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:41,379
a sense of humor they had time for a

739
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:43,810
sense of humor

740
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:45,880
I mentioned reconnaissance we did

741
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:47,980
open-source collection back in those

742
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:50,440
days I said we didn't have you know all

743
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:52,690
the stuff we have available to us now we

744
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,610
had some rudimentary search databases

745
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:56,860
that were available there were mostly

746
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:59,020
searching databases because that's where

747
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:00,850
information was kept large mainframes

748
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:03,160
had large databases at large

749
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:05,709
universities and they would set up very

750
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:09,760
rudimentary search engines that you

751
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:13,510
could use things like Archie you also

752
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:16,120
back then every IP address for every

753
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:17,950
system was internet routable we didn't

754
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,330
do Net masking then and you if you

755
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:21,850
wanted to be on the Internet you had to

756
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:25,870
purchase or lease I piece address space

757
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:28,209
Class A's B's C's subnets and everything

758
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:30,310
had an address so you could look up you

759
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:33,130
know if you had a target that was X Y Z

760
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:35,200
dot gov since this is in the military at

761
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:38,110
the time or dot mil you could look up

762
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,850
and see what XY Z dot mil owned in terms

763
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:41,320
of address space and that would help you

764
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:45,699
figure out what your targets were going

765
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:47,590
to be gopher is another search engine we

766
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:49,120
didn't have Google but what a kick-ass

767
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:51,010
search engine back in the day was

768
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,590
something called Alta Vista it

769
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:56,020
it was light years ahead of its time and

770
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:58,899
it was built on systems that were

771
00:31:56,020 --> 00:32:00,460
quicker than any other systems and then

772
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:03,160
of course you know we had the good old

773
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:06,040
Netscape Navigator Nick netscape browser

774
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:08,170
where you could start to do you know

775
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:10,870
things over the web rather than things

776
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:12,880
over these you know most of these other

777
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:15,310
search engines I go for Archie they were

778
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,740
they were command driven from a shell

779
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:21,070
where you were doing something like hell

780
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:23,620
netting to a database and then of course

781
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:25,450
the original Yahoo it might remember the

782
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:27,639
original Yahoo one of the features was

783
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:28,600
they had a click a button I forget what

784
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,370
it looked like and I don't have a

785
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,649
picture of it but there was somewhere on

786
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:34,540
it was like because nobody was on the

787
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:37,150
internet back then and web browsing was

788
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:38,649
kind of new they had kind of a roulette

789
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:40,570
button where you could click and just go

790
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:42,040
to a random website because they just

791
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:43,629
wanted people who experience the

792
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:47,710
Internet go and search what's out there

793
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:51,880
discover it was wonderful we would

794
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:53,590
acquire targets using things again we

795
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:55,960
didn't have end maps so we had something

796
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:57,879
called strobe strobe was a tool that was

797
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:59,080
written that would do TCP port scanning

798
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:01,030
so you could figure out what services

799
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:03,850
are live what systems were out there

800
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:05,530
you'd figured out the address space so

801
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:07,139
now you could figure out how you were

802
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:09,940
going to get to it

803
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:14,800
trivia quiz and buddy know who wrote

804
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:16,570
strobe I didn't remember it either until

805
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:22,480
I saw the name strobe was actually

806
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:23,980
written by Julian Assange I don't know

807
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,600
why that's interesting I just when I was

808
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:27,250
looking up and doing the research and I

809
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,139
saw that and like that's why the guy's

810
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:30,910
name sounds familiar because every time

811
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:32,440
you would launch strobe a little you

812
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:34,420
know welcome to strobe version whatever

813
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:38,260
written by Julianna sighs like I knew

814
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:42,610
that guy's name sounded familiar other

815
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:45,760
search engines you know looking up

816
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:47,770
domain registrations and you know people

817
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,440
would name systems and things like that

818
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:52,810
and of course nslookup which again

819
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:54,640
nothing was private everything was at

820
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:57,610
you know everything was addressable and

821
00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:00,130
reachable and so and then a name service

822
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:01,899
lookup here's the IP address what's the

823
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:04,820
name of the system that's using that IP

824
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:07,580
address we had rudimentary

825
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:09,379
network mapping tools and and it was

826
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:10,909
kind of fun didn't really give you a

827
00:34:09,379 --> 00:34:14,149
whole lot but it gave you an idea of

828
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:21,940
sort of the topology sometimes another

829
00:34:14,149 --> 00:34:24,319
date anyone at least somebody's guessing

830
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:27,710
first time the pants came down and the

831
00:34:24,319 --> 00:34:29,779
crack came out crack is an early

832
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:31,940
password cracking tool one of the one of

833
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:34,040
the things we bit did back then

834
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:35,359
was crack passwords and that was a way

835
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,980
to get into systems of course that

836
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:41,319
problems been solved and passwords are

837
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:43,730
no longer an issue back in those days

838
00:34:41,319 --> 00:34:45,649
passwords were kept with user IDs and

839
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:47,179
something called the Etsy password file

840
00:34:45,649 --> 00:34:50,868
there was no shadowing there was no

841
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:53,210
hiding home I blacked out real people's

842
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:56,089
names but you know those are the user

843
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:58,190
IDs and then a colon and then a hash

844
00:34:56,089 --> 00:35:00,740
which is the password so you can copy

845
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:02,540
these files and run crack and figure out

846
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:04,819
how you know guess what all the

847
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:06,109
passwords were it was originally

848
00:35:04,819 --> 00:35:07,880
designed to be used by system

849
00:35:06,109 --> 00:35:09,770
administrators to make sure users were

850
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:12,140
using good passwords not easily

851
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:13,790
guessable or breakable passwords but

852
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:17,509
again passwords have been solved now so

853
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:19,550
this is just ancient history one of the

854
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:21,560
common techniques back in the day of how

855
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:25,970
we would break into primarily UNIX

856
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:28,040
systems was to find applications and and

857
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:30,470
services that were running on the UNIX

858
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:33,589
system running was something that was

859
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:37,430
called set UID set UID meant that the

860
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:41,750
program even if you a mere user executed

861
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:44,149
the program it would run as the owner of

862
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:46,970
the program which very often was the

863
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:49,280
root account and what you could do with

864
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:51,410
that if you found a program like this if

865
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:54,800
you could get it - hiccup if you could

866
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:58,069
get it to halt execution very often it

867
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:01,069
would execute it would exit in the state

868
00:35:58,069 --> 00:36:02,779
of the ownership that it had so a very

869
00:36:01,069 --> 00:36:04,579
common way of getting a root shell was

870
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:08,230
just to find one of these scripts and

871
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:11,200
figure out how to get a way that alter

872
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:13,700
hold on

873
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:16,189
it will make it's making a better or a

874
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:17,609
figure a way to halt the execution it

875
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:23,910
would drop you on a root shell you

876
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:26,369
were done you had root so that's kind of

877
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:27,779
a very very very quick rudimentary

878
00:36:26,369 --> 00:36:29,430
snapshot of what we had to work with

879
00:36:27,779 --> 00:36:32,730
what we were dealing with in terms of

880
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:33,930
the tools in the tradecraft so I wanted

881
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:35,190
to share a little bit of our growing

882
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:38,460
pains

883
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:40,950
I mentioned this very early on go into a

884
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:43,799
little bit more detail we had this sort

885
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:45,629
of overarching challenge that NSA

886
00:36:43,799 --> 00:36:47,220
doesn't do what NSA does to u.s.

887
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:49,410
citizens and of course the idea of

888
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:52,049
testing systems you're testing us

889
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:54,720
systems so there were some people that

890
00:36:52,049 --> 00:36:57,839
had concern about that but there are

891
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:59,220
ways around you know getting get not

892
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:02,670
getting around the law but there were a

893
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:04,230
waste to meet the laws but do it in a

894
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:06,359
way where everybody was aware and that's

895
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:09,019
why we took a month to get permissions

896
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:14,130
to do things another date

897
00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:16,410
PGP PGP was revolutionary and it was

898
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:19,019
very scary for NSA because it was free

899
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:22,950
encryption Phil Zimmermann and in fact

900
00:37:19,019 --> 00:37:25,618
got into a lot of trouble because back

901
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:28,230
in those days crypto was classified as

902
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:30,569
munitions and therefore not exportable

903
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:33,989
to foreign powers and then PGP comes

904
00:37:30,569 --> 00:37:36,150
along free to everybody they they the US

905
00:37:33,989 --> 00:37:40,170
government tried to prosecute him for

906
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:43,109
years for violating basically committing

907
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:48,809
espionage by allowing munitions to be

908
00:37:43,109 --> 00:37:51,119
exported outside of the US but I have a

909
00:37:48,809 --> 00:37:54,390
different story to tell about PGP PGP

910
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:55,980
was impactful to NSA because we you know

911
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:58,129
because we built the crypto for our

912
00:37:55,980 --> 00:38:00,779
customers which was the Armed Forces

913
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:03,329
there was a day when one of the one of

914
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:05,700
the branches of the military came to us

915
00:38:03,329 --> 00:38:07,710
came to our management and said why are

916
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:10,499
we spending millions of dollars for NSA

917
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:12,779
to develop something to secure our email

918
00:38:10,499 --> 00:38:15,660
communications why can't we just use

919
00:38:12,779 --> 00:38:18,450
this PGP thing it's free so there was

920
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:20,129
this literal on hands on deck call from

921
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:21,359
our higher level highest levels of

922
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:22,440
management everybody was supposed to

923
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,150
drop what they were doing and

924
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:29,099
everybody's supposed to work on coming

925
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:30,810
up with an attack against PGP some a

926
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:33,330
group of guys that actually worked in

927
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:35,250
the office next to ours or across the

928
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:38,430
hallway from us came up with a very

929
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:40,320
clever attack against PGP and they were

930
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:42,750
hailed as heroes they're given all sorts

931
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,640
of cash awards they were taken down to

932
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:46,470
DC and the Pentagon and had to do

933
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,330
briefings about this wonderful attack

934
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:49,560
that they came up with let me tell you

935
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:51,240
about what the attack real quickly I

936
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,950
learned about it some months afterwards

937
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:55,200
where they did like a brown-bag lunch

938
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:58,649
and learn just for us minions that

939
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,750
worked with them they described how they

940
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:02,970
took a I want to say at the time it was

941
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:05,220
word star which was our word processing

942
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:07,200
document application at the time they

943
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:08,790
found some unused byte space in the

944
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,149
document and they were able to insert

945
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:14,160
some code in that document that would

946
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:17,430
extract the public and private key rings

947
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:19,319
that PGP relies upon and attach it to a

948
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:21,930
document and email it out the next time

949
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:25,140
so all they had to do was send this

950
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:26,940
email as an attachment to somebody get

951
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:29,129
them to click on it and open it it would

952
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:31,920
launch the attack and they would steal

953
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:35,070
the key rings PGP is broken does this

954
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:39,270
sound familiar to anyone what is what

955
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:44,460
did I just describe a phishing attack

956
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:47,460
right this was like 1995 so if you think

957
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:49,470
phishing attacks are new I beg beg to

958
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:52,290
disagree with you

959
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:54,419
I had the when I heard this lunch

960
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:57,450
briefing and they described this to him

961
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:59,400
and they got to the Q&A time I raised my

962
00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:02,069
hand I said wouldn't this attack work

963
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:04,260
against our stuff too and they kind of

964
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:05,760
stopped and thought I said yeah it

965
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:07,650
probably would and I said then why are

966
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,420
we making such a big deal out of this

967
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:12,630
there they got very indignant said well

968
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:17,250
we were passed with breaking PGP not our

969
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:19,080
own stuff okay whatever I actually again

970
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:20,640
another fanboy moment I got to meet Phil

971
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:22,560
Zimmerman last fall I was down in

972
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,540
Atlanta at the Issa International

973
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,860
Conference now I got to tell him that

974
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:28,200
story he got a kick out of it

975
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:32,760
so we're buds now too I've met all my

976
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:34,740
heroes now I think so let me share our

977
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:36,930
share I said I wasn't going to share one

978
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:39,600
any of this top-secret stuff we did but

979
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:41,220
I do want to share one with you so you

980
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:43,049
know let's not let this leave this room

981
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:44,549
suffer it's being recorded

982
00:40:43,049 --> 00:40:48,440
I'm going to share some of our

983
00:40:44,549 --> 00:40:59,160
top-secret tradecraft are you ready for

984
00:40:48,440 --> 00:41:01,950
this was our primary attack tool you

985
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,519
know it's it's that whole Paul's for

986
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:05,249
effect

987
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:08,910
imagine a world where you have to wait a

988
00:41:05,249 --> 00:41:13,919
month to get permission to issue a ping

989
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:19,680
command and imagine how that didn't sit

990
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:21,239
well with us so what we had to do was

991
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,799
start working with our lawyers our

992
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:25,289
general counsel because they were the

993
00:41:22,799 --> 00:41:27,390
ones that were not making the rules but

994
00:41:25,289 --> 00:41:29,460
they were enforcing the rules or helping

995
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:32,239
us to find ways to work within the

996
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:35,099
boundaries that we had been provided and

997
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:37,140
their original idea was well just tell

998
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:39,269
us ahead of time all the different

999
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:41,308
tricks and techniques and tools you use

1000
00:41:39,269 --> 00:41:43,319
and we'll kind of pre approve them so

1001
00:41:41,309 --> 00:41:44,489
that when you have a job come up you

1002
00:41:43,319 --> 00:41:46,380
know you'll just sort of click through

1003
00:41:44,489 --> 00:41:47,849
an ala carte menu and tell us you know

1004
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:49,109
we're gonna do a couple pings and we're

1005
00:41:47,849 --> 00:41:51,779
gonna do a couple of this and a couple

1006
00:41:49,109 --> 00:41:54,049
of that and we know what those are and

1007
00:41:51,779 --> 00:41:57,599
so we'll prove it much more quickly and

1008
00:41:54,049 --> 00:41:59,489
for some reason I was the one that

1009
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:00,839
either volunteered or got stuck with

1010
00:41:59,489 --> 00:42:02,190
working with the lawyers I think it's

1011
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:04,078
because I have a brother that's a lawyer

1012
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:06,089
and I felt like I could speak their

1013
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:07,440
language so I ended up working with the

1014
00:42:06,089 --> 00:42:08,819
lawyers and trying to explain to them

1015
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,499
that you know it's not that simple

1016
00:42:08,819 --> 00:42:13,019
because it's a very imprecise science

1017
00:42:10,499 --> 00:42:15,238
this is an art form you don't know what

1018
00:42:13,019 --> 00:42:16,558
you're gonna do until you encounter what

1019
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:18,059
you encounter and you're not going to

1020
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:20,009
know what you're encountering until you

1021
00:42:18,059 --> 00:42:23,759
start probing and looking at it and of

1022
00:42:20,009 --> 00:42:25,710
course you know ping was considered the

1023
00:42:23,759 --> 00:42:28,170
reason why I was considered top-secret

1024
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:31,259
was it was ruled by the lawyers to be an

1025
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:33,779
act of attack because it elicited a

1026
00:42:31,259 --> 00:42:38,069
response from the target that was the

1027
00:42:33,779 --> 00:42:41,160
mentality that we were walking into you

1028
00:42:38,069 --> 00:42:43,950
know they had their ideas we had our

1029
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:45,899
ideas what I ended up doing was we ended

1030
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:47,999
up meeting on a weekly basis this was a

1031
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:50,729
popular TV show at the time home

1032
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:53,098
improvement and the show within the show

1033
00:42:50,729 --> 00:42:54,759
was called tool time so I started a

1034
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:58,900
weekly meeting with the Gen

1035
00:42:54,760 --> 00:43:00,340
council just teaching them all about our

1036
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:02,140
trade craft and all about the things

1037
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:04,840
that we did and just sort of debunking

1038
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:07,150
and and demystifying this thing called

1039
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:08,770
network security or Internet security

1040
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:10,900
which was really just teaching them how

1041
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:12,700
to use unix and teaching them about you

1042
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:15,040
know things like file permissions and

1043
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:17,439
and things like trust relationships

1044
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:19,750
which was basically just how unix worked

1045
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,220
but it was magical to him it was

1046
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:22,570
eye-opening and in fact you know he

1047
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:24,700
would you know we were on networks

1048
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:26,700
within a network and we were on sub

1049
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:29,379
networks that were supposedly isolated

1050
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:33,370
but very often I would demonstrate the

1051
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:36,430
violation of trust by modifying his file

1052
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:38,650
right in front of him his login file so

1053
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:40,750
that I could gain access later and then

1054
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:43,120
would do things to him for a week and

1055
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:44,830
then come back and show him but one of

1056
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:47,290
the most eye-opening things for him was

1057
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:49,299
we looked at his simple directory

1058
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:51,580
structure and things that he had in

1059
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:53,410
terms of work product as a lawyer that

1060
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:55,600
he thought was super secret that nobody

1061
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:59,470
could see very often were in world

1062
00:43:55,600 --> 00:44:01,360
readable directory files than anybody in

1063
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:05,350
the whole you know organization could

1064
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:07,180
look at that was eye-opening for and

1065
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:11,440
while I was doing all that I still did

1066
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:13,629
stuff with family word got out you know

1067
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:16,000
we were doing this fun stuff you know at

1068
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:17,800
first it was in s NSA only and it was

1069
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,410
within the DoD community you know the

1070
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:23,820
Armed Forces we're doing it and I don't

1071
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:26,890
really remember the details but somehow

1072
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:29,530
other agencies found out so we were

1073
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:32,259
approached by the Department of Justice

1074
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:33,880
this isn't actually a clip of an article

1075
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:36,220
that came out a couple years after I

1076
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:39,100
left it talks about what I'm about to

1077
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:41,410
describe to you but basically we were

1078
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:43,600
approached by the Department of Justice

1079
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:45,220
they wanted us to look at their internet

1080
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,509
presence and do what we were calling a

1081
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:48,209
vulnerability assessment or a

1082
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:51,460
vulnerability a threat assessment

1083
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:52,600
against their internet presence of

1084
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:54,610
course we had to go to the lawyer's

1085
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:57,940
because you know we're not supposed to

1086
00:44:54,610 --> 00:45:01,810
do that to US citizens and especially

1087
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:04,030
not unclassified systems NSA was allowed

1088
00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:07,060
to do what NSA did traditionally to

1089
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:08,100
classified systems the organization that

1090
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:09,870
was responsible

1091
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:12,420
unclassified systems at the time was

1092
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:15,529
NIST but it was well understood at the

1093
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:17,550
time that NIST didn't have the the

1094
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:19,860
capability that they didn't have that

1095
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:22,140
anyone that had the chops nobody was

1096
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:24,210
doing this at NIST so it was very common

1097
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:26,129
we learned through the lawyers that NIST

1098
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:28,650
would sort of you know do a little

1099
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:32,310
handoff to NSA asking for a special

1100
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:33,630
favor anyway I went to the lawyer and

1101
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:35,520
learned what the rules were and

1102
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:37,530
basically it said well it needs to be a

1103
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:39,210
cabinet-level sort of personal favor

1104
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:41,850
from the Department of Justice through

1105
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:47,340
the Department of Defense so a letter

1106
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:49,140
came from the address to the person

1107
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:50,850
responsible for this stuff which was an

1108
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:53,160
assistant secretary of defense at the

1109
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:55,049
time and it actually it was signed by

1110
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:57,390
the Attorney General at the time Janet

1111
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:59,310
Reno and it said hey could you do that

1112
00:45:57,390 --> 00:46:03,330
cool stuff that those kids are doing at

1113
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:05,220
NSA to us please and I was working with

1114
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:07,980
you know it was like a three months

1115
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:09,779
process to get all these you know memos

1116
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:11,370
written you know I don't know if you

1117
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:13,110
know it but you know the the people that

1118
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:14,910
write these letters they don't write

1119
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:16,230
them they're written by the lawyers and

1120
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:18,540
people that work for them and it all

1121
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:21,870
gets negotiated down to every jot and

1122
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:23,970
tittle and word and ultimately was

1123
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:26,460
signed by our director going back to say

1124
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:28,140
yeah we'd be happy to do this you can

1125
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:31,740
see my name is listed as the point of

1126
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:34,109
contact I I kept all this information

1127
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:39,080
because you should always keep things in

1128
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:39,080
writing that are that are kind of edgy

1129
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:44,760
right before we got a chance to do it

1130
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:48,299
this thing happened this was the first

1131
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:51,390
hack of a government website it was a

1132
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:52,890
big deal back in the day although in the

1133
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:54,750
grand scheme of things all they did was

1134
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:55,710
website two-faced but they didn't steal

1135
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:58,050
personal data

1136
00:46:55,710 --> 00:46:59,670
they didn't find out any deep secrets

1137
00:46:58,050 --> 00:47:02,730
about what the Department of Justice was

1138
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:04,920
doing and we could go off on a tangent

1139
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:07,470
there but we won't what it was at the

1140
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:09,060
time was you know the Department of

1141
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:10,560
Justice which had their own network

1142
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:12,299
which had their own internet facing

1143
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:14,700
systems and they'd set up their own web

1144
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:17,870
server it was defaced by hackers and

1145
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:20,359
they discovered this over a weekend

1146
00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:22,190
and of course what do you do when your

1147
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:24,170
system has been compromised you pulled

1148
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:27,320
the plug you wipe it yeah and and you

1149
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:28,730
start over but I got a call from the guy

1150
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:33,020
that I've been working with on a Monday

1151
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:34,790
morning and he said help and so I set

1152
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:37,190
out to find out how to help them so I

1153
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:39,529
you know a group of us from the pit went

1154
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:41,480
down to DC we spent a couple days with

1155
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:46,220
them I'm making a long story short but

1156
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:47,600
we were there for about three days we

1157
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:49,819
weren't finding a whole lot there were

1158
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:52,069
no forensics courses there were no

1159
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:53,270
forensics methodologies at the time so

1160
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:54,470
we were kind of learnt you know the

1161
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:56,270
first thing we learned was you know you

1162
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:58,759
destroyed all the evidence so we really

1163
00:47:56,270 --> 00:48:00,800
don't have anything to look at but there

1164
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:02,720
were some other you know devices on the

1165
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:05,120
network you know other systems that week

1166
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:06,950
we were looking at but we were there for

1167
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:09,230
about three days when I got a call from

1168
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:12,049
somebody who had stayed behind it the

1169
00:48:09,230 --> 00:48:13,730
pit that said shit's hit the fan you

1170
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:17,780
guys got to drop everything and just

1171
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:19,700
come back now and so we dropped

1172
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:22,490
everything we went back we were escorted

1173
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:24,710
into the Deputy Director of NSA's

1174
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:26,720
conference room and the lawyer that I'd

1175
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:29,090
been working with for the previous year

1176
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:31,399
proceeded to read us the riot act and

1177
00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:33,200
tell us about how we had done all sorts

1178
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:35,390
of illegal things because we were doing

1179
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,980
things too unclassified systems and

1180
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:39,080
we're not supposed to in NSA isn't

1181
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:40,700
supposed to do what NSA does to u.s.

1182
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:42,140
citizens and we were doing it and we

1183
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:42,649
hadn't gone through the right procedures

1184
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:44,000
and rules

1185
00:48:42,650 --> 00:48:45,740
trust me I've gone through the

1186
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,540
procedures and rules I had asked the

1187
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:50,600
general counsel what do I need to do to

1188
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:53,090
get there but somebody in the executive

1189
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:54,589
management chain somewhere got their

1190
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:57,680
nose out of joint and blew the whistle

1191
00:48:54,590 --> 00:49:01,430
on it it became a big deal I do a whole

1192
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:05,299
talk on this but the bottom line was

1193
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:07,609
they tried to get us in trouble and they

1194
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:08,720
and because I was the ringleader they

1195
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:12,620
tried to fire me

1196
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:14,600
and and they couldn't because every time

1197
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:16,549
I interviewed somebody from security

1198
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,600
they said really that's it that's what

1199
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:19,430
you were doing you were just trying to

1200
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:21,650
help I was like yeah and then everybody

1201
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:25,640
dismissed it it was traumatic for me at

1202
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:27,410
the time but the upshot was one of the

1203
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:28,839
things we learned was and I became a

1204
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:30,999
contributor to one of the

1205
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:33,519
first sins institute documents on

1206
00:49:30,999 --> 00:49:35,700
incident handling i think i think they

1207
00:49:33,519 --> 00:49:38,258
listed me as like an editor or reviewer

1208
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:39,819
but it was you know putting out the

1209
00:49:38,259 --> 00:49:41,650
basic steps like don't destroy the

1210
00:49:39,819 --> 00:49:43,359
evidence you know pull the plug if you

1211
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:45,160
must off the internet but preserve

1212
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:48,759
everything take it offline so you can

1213
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:52,960
look at it the upshot though was we were

1214
00:49:48,759 --> 00:49:55,450
ultimately sort of vindicated and we

1215
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:57,130
were we were we were escorted back into

1216
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:58,629
that conference room and talked to by

1217
00:49:57,130 --> 00:50:00,880
senior management and they said look we

1218
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:03,160
love what you guys are doing and and

1219
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,930
we'd love for you to do that here but if

1220
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:07,598
you're gonna do it here you have to do

1221
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:11,799
it by our rules so a lot of us just up

1222
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:14,069
and left myself included the six people

1223
00:50:11,799 --> 00:50:16,809
that were originally members of the pit

1224
00:50:14,069 --> 00:50:20,288
two of them are still at NSA four of us

1225
00:50:16,809 --> 00:50:22,119
are out in private practice the only

1226
00:50:20,289 --> 00:50:25,479
other person that I'm allowed to say who

1227
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:26,859
was a member of the pit is Ron gula if

1228
00:50:25,479 --> 00:50:31,868
you don't know Ron gula he was the

1229
00:50:26,859 --> 00:50:36,369
founder of tenable network security the

1230
00:50:31,869 --> 00:50:38,440
authors of necess the third one of the

1231
00:50:36,369 --> 00:50:40,359
other people out in public he he has on

1232
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:42,519
his LinkedIn profile that he did NSA

1233
00:50:40,359 --> 00:50:45,130
pentesting and I have yet to talk to him

1234
00:50:42,519 --> 00:50:45,910
to include his picture on this slide but

1235
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:47,769
I'm working on it

1236
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:50,739
the fourth guy very private guy he'll

1237
00:50:47,769 --> 00:50:54,669
never never agree to be associated with

1238
00:50:50,739 --> 00:50:56,559
any of us but that's us so you know as

1239
00:50:54,670 --> 00:50:58,029
an epilogue you know we've all you know

1240
00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:01,869
many of us have been out in the private

1241
00:50:58,029 --> 00:51:03,910
sector for many years I won't even ask

1242
00:51:01,869 --> 00:51:05,410
nobody knows what this is but going back

1243
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:07,149
to that book where they wrote about the

1244
00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:09,879
pit the chapter four which was eligible

1245
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:11,710
receiver eligible receiver happens from

1246
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:14,109
June 9th to the 13th you know about

1247
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:16,029
three and a half days back in 1997 I

1248
00:51:14,109 --> 00:51:19,119
left in October of 96

1249
00:51:16,029 --> 00:51:22,690
what eligibles receiver was was a joint

1250
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:25,359
NSA wide hack of the DoD it was designed

1251
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:27,460
and set up to be very clandestine not

1252
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:29,558
not anybody you know very few people

1253
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:31,960
knew about it for any of the targets any

1254
00:51:29,559 --> 00:51:33,489
of the military services and there was a

1255
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:36,009
lot of coordination with the Pentagon

1256
00:51:33,489 --> 00:51:38,410
and so on and so forth and it was

1257
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:39,880
designed to last I think for 14 days and

1258
00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:40,580
they had to cut it after three because

1259
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:44,030
they'd already

1260
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:45,799
and everything they talked about it I

1261
00:51:44,030 --> 00:51:48,380
guess it was on the 20th anniversary

1262
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:50,180
because it was in the fall of 2017 they

1263
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:51,950
did a symposium called cyber at the

1264
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:54,799
crossroads at the University of Maryland

1265
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:57,410
University College and they got all the

1266
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,790
big you know senior management types

1267
00:51:57,410 --> 00:52:00,230
that were smarter than all of us

1268
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:02,810
actually doing the work to get together

1269
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:05,000
and talk about it and of course I wasn't

1270
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:06,440
included but what I did learn and I

1271
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,270
think that website is still up there

1272
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:10,700
although they've they've pulled down

1273
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:13,790
like the video recordings I think the

1274
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:17,120
guy will email it to you on request but

1275
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:18,680
they basically said nobody from the know

1276
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:20,450
but none of the original members of the

1277
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:22,790
Pitt participated in the eligible

1278
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:24,500
receiver one of the idea was they didn't

1279
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:26,210
want to have the uber elite hackers

1280
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:28,090
doing it they wanted to have just sort

1281
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:31,190
of run-of-the-mill hackers so they

1282
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:33,710
trained the B team to go out and do

1283
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:35,780
eligible receiver so I don't know if I'm

1284
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:37,910
feeling honored by that or feeling

1285
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:43,390
snubbed I haven't decided yet but I was

1286
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:46,520
gone anyway September 1st 1997

1287
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:50,810
that's when nmap came out for all of

1288
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:52,460
those you that love and map those of us

1289
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:54,279
that are were the original members of

1290
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:56,660
the pit we still try to get together

1291
00:52:54,280 --> 00:53:00,230
once or twice a year it's usually over

1292
00:52:56,660 --> 00:53:01,609
breakfast one of our recent visits one

1293
00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:03,560
of the guys is still worked there he

1294
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:04,790
brought some tchotchke for us there's

1295
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:06,440
this place called the National

1296
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:08,480
Cryptologic Museum that's outside of

1297
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:10,010
Fort Meade outside of NSA I encourage

1298
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:12,140
you if you ever come to Maryland to

1299
00:53:10,010 --> 00:53:14,630
visit it they have a gift shop where you

1300
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:18,410
can get cool stuff like NSA secret sauce

1301
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:20,990
who doesn't want that and you know you

1302
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:23,270
can get an NSA pen that projects a light

1303
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:25,310
signal which is the NSA seal so that's

1304
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:26,810
not a seal on a cup that's a projection

1305
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:29,180
that's coming from that pen

1306
00:53:26,810 --> 00:53:32,029
they got t-shirts they've got they've

1307
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:34,359
got flash whiskey bottles wine glasses

1308
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:37,160
shot glass with all sorts of fun stuff

1309
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:38,990
so you know and it all supports the

1310
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:41,000
civilian welfare fun which gives

1311
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:46,220
employees discount tickets the Orioles

1312
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:48,650
game so that's it in a nutshell problem

1313
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:50,750

1341
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:58,490
is a serious semi serious thing people

1344
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:04,280
know there's books that I showed you at

1345
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:06,470

Internet and UNIX security written by

1347
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:12,620
Spafford staff as you go as he's known

1348
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:14,840
to his friends there's a small group of

1349
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:16,250
people mostly old-timers that go to

1350
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:18,140
dinner with them and they call

1351
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:20,450
themselves a cabal of the curmudgeons I

1352
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:24,160
was invited into that group two years

1353
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:27,859
ago and the person that sort of

1354
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:29,870
sponsored me into the group is the guy

1355
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:32,230
on the end there in the red sweater that

1356
00:55:29,870 --> 00:55:34,520
I had my arm around he was the one that

1357
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:35,990
represented me into the group and I was

1358
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:38,900
voted in and once you're in you're in

1359
00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:41,029
for life the guy that I had my arm

1360
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:43,040
around happens to be the lawyer the

1361
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:45,230
