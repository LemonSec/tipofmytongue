1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,400
I'll say or roll them and then I will

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:10,830
start alright hello thank you so very

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:15,089
much for taking time to come see this

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:18,779
talk this talk is primarily about button

5
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:21,090
it's primarily about how do we make a

6
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:23,490
transition from point A to point B maybe

7
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,109
you've been in this industry a long time

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,400
maybe you're thinking of transitioning

9
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:28,410
from one to the other

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,419
maybe you're just stuck in a rut and

11
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:33,420
trying to figure out what you're doing

12
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:37,260
but I think all of us safely can say at

13
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:40,290
some point or another we have faced our

14
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:43,019
own version of impostor syndrome right

15
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,149
we've all gone through the nope not me I

16
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,820
don't know enough oh my gosh I'm just

17
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:50,940
terrified I'm not good enough I'm not

18
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:53,250
good thing the thing whatever your thing

19
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,800
is I'm going to start instead with a

20
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,050
story and kind of get back to that so I

21
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,358
don't know how you grew up but in my

22
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,370
house my brother had this stereo which

23
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,890
meant I had to watch or listen or

24
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:08,310
whatever to what he wanted to do so that

25
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:12,840
meant 80s music it was the 80s so the

26
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:14,460
band yes oh five there were all kinds of

27
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,930
crazy ways people would try to get

28
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,330
information you'd get it on the radio

29
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,700
right but let's talk about that for a

30
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,560
second there was no internet yeah there

31
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,580
was no ease there were no devices in

32
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,710
your hand well they were they were

33
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,380
Walkman right so you might have had

34
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,419
headsets or whatever but my brother had

35
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,280
yes nine oh one two five and he played

36
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,330
it over and over again and I discovered

37
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:40,320
my own sound the thing I liked it was

38
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:43,440
rinse the art of noise was a couple of

39
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:46,229
crazy people in a lab making music in my

40
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:48,000
mind and so what happens is I go and

41
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:50,100
fast forward a few years after having

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,350
been force-fed owner of a lonely heart

43
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:55,380
and this entire album of really

44
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:57,990
creatively built stuff and I said but

45
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,690
where's my stuff I won like my own if

46
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:03,869
you grew up depending on how you grew up

47
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:07,770
we only had the one stereo so I got to

48
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:10,440
hear a lot of yes music meanwhile I went

49
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,690
back later on and took another listen to

50
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,970
nano 125 when I had some clarity

51
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,440
distance we're talking years and I

52
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:19,050
discovered some new things about myself

53
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,790
I learned that I really dug the way they

54
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:22,920
built this album and I said but why

55
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,420
would I care what is it that makes this

56
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,630
so different it turns out there's this

57
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:29,910
dude his name is Trevor Horn and it

58
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:32,250
found it turns out he has made tons of

59
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:34,170
albums that I've always I've heard that

60
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,180
song and that song and these are all

61
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:38,850
really popular things maybe I just love

62
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,110
Trevor Horn as a producer you know do

63
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:41,970
they know it's Christmas if you ever

64
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:43,410
heard of relax don't do it Frankie Goes

65
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,060
to Hollywood that kind of thing

66
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:47,070
I just like his work but whatever

67
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:50,040
happened to the art of noise well they

68
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:51,150
broke up right nothing new gone bye-bye

69
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,329
thanks so much for playing

70
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,770
except they brought out one of these

71
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:57,150
liquidation sale box sets I don't know

72
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:59,400
if you've seen this with any of your

73
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:01,050
bands it was basically just piles of

74
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,590
music there was nothing new in it and it

75
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,959
was gone

76
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:06,270
but if we come forward much closer to

77
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:08,100
now meaning like last year two years ago

78
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:10,260
you get to wondering where play now

79
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,970
whatever happened and maybe you stumbled

80
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:14,910
across something in your social media to

81
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:18,989
find in the margin all another AD by

82
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:22,829
accident it turns out I found out that

83
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:24,510
there's this guy you look through about

84
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,590
that guy who produced the albums and

85
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,149
everything else he had a music

86
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:30,810
programmer that worked for him his name

87
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:32,160
is JJ jeselsohn JJ Gesell's sake is the

88
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,980
thread that ties this story together

89
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:37,440
because it turns out this producer had

90
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:42,869
his programmer and that programmer had

91
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:44,430
happened to be working on 901 25 and was

92
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,560
listening to some drum beats he was

93
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:48,750
capturing to help produce the album and

94
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,980
it turns out during that he got this

95
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:54,180
crazy idea

96
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:56,849
to make the art of noise so the thing

97
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:58,890
that I grew up loathing turns out to be

98
00:03:56,849 --> 00:04:02,129
the only reason the order of noise

99
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:05,010
actually existed that is a huge thing to

100
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:07,079
me right what if it turns out this thing

101
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:09,149
that drove you crazy as a younger person

102
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,920
turns out to be the catalyst that

103
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,630
created something you absolutely loved

104
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,760
how do you deal with that in your head

105
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:17,279
but that's kind of like the way that our

106
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,108
careers work isn't it because your

107
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:22,950
career and I need to get up here so I

108
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:24,810
can see a reference to my slides your

109
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,909
career is like that it takes time to

110
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,830
learn and grow it takes time for you to

111
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,970
figure out what direction you want to go

112
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:32,250
in and that's what this is really going

113
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:35,370
to be about because I've found it is

114
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:38,190
immensely rewarding to be able to help

115
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:40,229
people find their path right and I think

116
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:42,960
it comes to us in waves it goes in

117
00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:46,380
different ways as we progress so how do

118
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,930
you do that how do we value or excuse me

119
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:51,690
add value to ourselves or other people

120
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:54,539
and that's where conferences become this

121
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:56,430
amazing place not just that we all get

122
00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:58,680
together in a room and talk about the

123
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:01,320
stuff that broke work didn't work we

124
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:04,289
need interaction to figure out the next

125
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:06,300
step of our journeys to know that we're

126
00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:07,860
not alone even if you know it's to talk

127
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,990
about that thing that we're not thrilled

128
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,479
about it takes two people to say I hate

129
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:14,789
that I hate it though Oh boom and off

130
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:17,610
you go it's a start and that's what we

131
00:05:14,789 --> 00:05:21,300
need so one answer to add that value

132
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:22,919
could be maturity the ability to admit

133
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:27,360
were wrong or need help if you got to

134
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:29,580
see side dragons talk it's really a lot

135
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,460
about that maturity isn't it it was

136
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,270
working through his own

137
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:36,359
misunderstandings about himself his

138
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:38,880
misgivings his own trust issues among

139
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:41,610
other things but that's that maturity

140
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,400
another involves actively seeking the

141
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:47,970
help of other people or the influx of

142
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:50,489
new ideas hello welcome to Circle City

143
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:53,280
Colin it is a wonderful thing to have

144
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:55,500
the opportunity to stand here in a room

145
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:59,960
with you that you are actually here

146
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:02,099
listening to some idea from this guy I

147
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,690
appreciate each and every one of you who

148
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:06,330
took the time to come out here and hear

149
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:08,310
this because it means to me that you had

150
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:10,260
a curiosity or a break in your schedule

151
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:13,229
either one I'm good with both at this

152
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:15,090
point the thing is we cover these idea

153
00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:18,419
as an arc have you ever heard of a story

154
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:20,130
arc story arcs are these ideas that hey

155
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:21,390
there's kind of a first part and then

156
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:23,430
you're gonna come back and visit another

157
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:27,300
part of the same story if you've ever

158
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:29,700
seen things like oh I don't know pulp

159
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:31,320
fiction or a story that you just see a

160
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:33,450
piece of it and they aren't necessarily

161
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:36,090
told in order but you come to realize

162
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:38,250
it's all part of a larger story that's

163
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:40,890
what this is going to be about now

164
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:42,840
that's the metaphor we will use to do

165
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:44,340
have this discussion but there are some

166
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,260
disclaimers that are necessary as we go

167
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,580
on our journey together and that is that

168
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:49,289
you have to leave the comfort of the

169
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:51,570
herd if you ever saw that show from a

170
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:53,340
few years back called Chuck it was the

171
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:55,289
idea that you can't just stay in your

172
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:58,469
little group Chris talked about this too

173
00:06:55,289 --> 00:07:00,900
if you have an opportunity to go out on

174
00:06:58,469 --> 00:07:04,349
your devices or look up a talk or to

175
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:07,770
look for a talk by L o bunk that's a ll

176
00:07:04,349 --> 00:07:11,280
o Punk that talks about how to be a

177
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:14,159
mentor and how to get mentored it's a

178
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,539
fantastic talk that helps expand these

179
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:17,820
ideas that we're about to go over

180
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:19,560
another one is from my friend who's

181
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,570
sitting in the back of the room yes it's

182
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,090
Kathleen sitting right back there she

183
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:28,289
does a great talk that actually covers

184
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:30,960
how we communicate and build in a

185
00:07:28,289 --> 00:07:32,340
community how do we volunteer what does

186
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,650
it mean what do we do and how do we

187
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,719
learn and that's where we go with this

188
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:39,120
because you will need jerks this is not

189
00:07:36,719 --> 00:07:40,770
going to be easy this is going to be

190
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,190
there are times where you get nipped or

191
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:46,650
toughts down two or misspoken two or

192
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:48,530
about and these things are going to

193
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:50,580
happen and they're going to stink

194
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:52,859
they're gonna stink and they're gonna

195
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:55,409
hurt and that goes right back to side

196
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:57,450
dragon again that emotion if you CLO

197
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:59,460
Punk's talk it talks about dealing with

198
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:01,770
that and how do you feel what's your

199
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:04,138
self-worth and going back to adding that

200
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:06,659
value but persistence pays we know

201
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:08,459
gatekeeping is bad but persistence will

202
00:08:06,659 --> 00:08:10,529
win the day most of the time so let's

203
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:12,470
talk about this the agenda again in

204
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:15,050
story marks right and being able to

205
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:20,330
understand all of these parts of one

206
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:21,950
journey yours this is about you where

207
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:23,050
you are so we're going to talk through

208
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:27,800
some of these

209
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:30,770
if you imagine again it's as you prefer

210
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,870
it's getting that start and saying how

211
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:34,939
do I drink from this firehose and moving

212
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:37,520
on to wait I think I figured out where I

213
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:39,080
want to be and then it's oh wow wait I

214
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,780
think I have something to contribute and

215
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,330
then you realize you know I think it

216
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:46,040
would be rewarding to help others

217
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:48,260
contribute and then you have to defend

218
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:51,170
at all levels against the big bad

219
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:54,620
burnout beast well let's get into it

220
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:56,990
there are many types and locations for

221
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:58,820
cons and events you got your local stuff

222
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:00,680
you've got regional stuff you should

223
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:02,630
always start at the meet-up and the

224
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,459
local professional associations earlier

225
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:06,620
I'd like to tell you if this difficut

226
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,090
right here that's amazing and you're ok

227
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,500
great and thank you very much and I'll

228
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:11,390
have a piece of that pie that's terrific

229
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,040
thank you very much Oh a drink ticket

230
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:14,569
I'll take one and you move on and you

231
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,579
try to figure out where you can go I

232
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:18,230
know why don't you visit a local or

233
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:20,480
regional b-sides conference that would

234
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:23,270
be nice why because you need to do that

235
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,460
before you take on some of these if you

236
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:27,230
have ever gone to Def Con or some other

237
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:29,450
larger event and you're like oh my gosh

238
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:32,270
look at all the people if you go to the

239
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:33,980
shopping mall and decide you might want

240
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:35,870
to rethink just going to Def Con as your

241
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:37,339
first outing all by your lonesome it's

242
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:39,890
great to get a travel buddy or someone

243
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:42,560
you can say too much time to go see the

244
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:44,930
pinball museum whatever it is now when

245
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,520
you look at your traveling further you

246
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:49,099
can learn about other cultures it

247
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:52,220
broadens your own perspective which is

248
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:54,170
what we need to do each of us is to

249
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:56,360
realize being alone in the room will not

250
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:58,910
help you get out of the situation you're

251
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,740
in if you're trying to grow your career

252
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:03,770
or move forward you're going to have to

253
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:05,210
think about other places you know Circle

254
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:08,390
City Kong you should check that out

255
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:10,280
but really there are sometimes no

256
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:12,350
substitutes for finding a conference

257
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:15,470
that is more specialized to your need

258
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:17,780
because once you find that piece of

259
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:20,540
direction that gets you going that

260
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:21,920
really programs you or gives you that

261
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,990
sense of oh my gosh

262
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,930
I am NOT going to bed tonight or how

263
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:28,490
get to be sunup you've maybe found it

264
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:30,739
and there are specific events just for

265
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:32,870
you but let's keep going a little bit

266
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:35,240
broader than that there are going to be

267
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:38,120
times that sorry to bite that bullet and

268
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:41,480
go on behalf of your company or of your

269
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:43,640
profession and go to the corporate it is

270
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,550
important it is part of life and you

271
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:48,920
will hear in a group like this a wide

272
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:51,649
range of experiences that will not be

273
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,779
yours yours is unique to you and you

274
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:55,820
need to embrace that fact because there

275
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:57,410
will be opportunities that other people

276
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:00,680
may or may not understand but you

277
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:05,360
yourself might grow to realize and by

278
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:06,920
the way sometimes it's okay to skip the

279
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,750
restroom apparently I don't know it's

280
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,910
the people who do CTF those who take

281
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:13,100
part in challenges sometimes fall in and

282
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:15,380
that's okay too because you need those

283
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:17,000
caps of the flag events to learn where

284
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:19,040
your limits are and what you can grow in

285
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,440
it's another way to do the same thing in

286
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,689
my mind the conference to your career is

287
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,580
the same it's just a much longer

288
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:28,520
engagement because it's the course of

289
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:30,980
your entire career in your career raise

290
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:32,990
your hand if you have ever said I don't

291
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:35,839
feel like going out there right now I'm

292
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:38,630
just going to stay home instead thank

293
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,930
you okay now let's move on to another

294
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:41,329
one

295
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:45,140
hey we have an event coming up across

296
00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:46,399
town who wants to go right why did you

297
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:48,410
raise your hand oh I don't have to sit

298
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,850
at the desk today or is it something

299
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:51,920
that you can actually leverage and dig

300
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:53,540
something out of hey we need you to go

301
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,399
talk to this vendor and help figure out

302
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:58,550
a situation it doesn't sound exciting

303
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:59,930
but maybe it is to you it depends on you

304
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:01,699
but let's move forward

305
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:03,229
let's with that career level one if we

306
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,480
were doing this as a day Indian game you

307
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:06,770
get out the dice in your role level one

308
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,910
you've got to fight the chickens in the

309
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:12,350
yard all right because you got to get

310
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:15,920
experience somewhere don't mistake your

311
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:19,190
local groups don't mistake the value of

312
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,689
that local support job the first step is

313
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:21,770
stepping out of the comfort zone getting

314
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:24,170
away from the herd

315
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:26,510
this seems illogical see part of this

316
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:28,760
talk is engineered to discuss those who

317
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:31,160
say I'm an intern I literally had this

318
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,990
conversation yesterday morning we

319
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,589
haven't introduced come to work with the

320
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:36,830
unit

321
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:38,540
work in they said I have no idea what I

322
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:40,340
want to do actually she doesn't sound

323
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,630
like that so please don't don't think

324
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:43,160
that's supposed to be an impression and

325
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:45,680
I'm not going to try it would be bad

326
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:49,880
because they sound much nicer the point

327
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:52,640
is when you're looking into what next if

328
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:54,320
there's a gray cloud going in your head

329
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:57,260
then this is a good thing to consider

330
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,300
talk about the maps what rings are there

331
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:01,160
that you need to step out and consider

332
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,990
once you get out and find the thing that

333
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,490
kind of interests you a little bit let's

334
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,900
just talk about what experience you're

335
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:07,640
expecting to get at level one when

336
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:09,020
you're fighting those chickens you're

337
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,640
going to have to look at that first

338
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:12,829
conference and I can't talk about other

339
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:15,680
people but it is literally like drinking

340
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:18,320
from a firehose the very first event I

341
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:21,890
went to was besides Las Vegas back in

342
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,750
2011 okay short story the guy who was up

343
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:26,689
here just a few minutes ago was the guy

344
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:28,670
I ran into didn't know who he was I just

345
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:30,950
got done helping you with some boxes and

346
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:33,500
I said what do I do now and he said what

347
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:35,420
can you do and he said why don't you go

348
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,190
join the security team out there well it

349
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:38,360
turns out someone flaked on the AV team

350
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,890
and I was able to join up with them

351
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,800
because that's where my experience was

352
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:45,890
but they gave me the chance you see I

353
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,439
had taken the chance to step it out they

354
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:51,470
allowed me to come in what will you do

355
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:53,360
for yourself in this way will you just

356
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:56,150
like Chris talked about the dog

357
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,650
shoveling the snow take the chance and

358
00:13:56,150 --> 00:14:03,260
step outside that comfort zone and push

359
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:05,209
for your experience you're gonna have to

360
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:07,069
get away from the wall if you have a lot

361
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:09,080
of trouble talking to folks this is

362
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:10,700
going to get in your way you're going to

363
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,290
have to work on that even if you walk up

364
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,150
the very first time and put your foot

365
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:15,740
all the way into your mouth and the only

366
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:17,750
thing that prevents you from inverting

367
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:19,910
entirely is your belt bottle it is

368
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,410
important to recognize mistakes will be

369
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:24,800
made

370
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:26,719
pass them get over them that's not easy

371
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,630
I'm the guy sitting appearances so

372
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,280
thanks I appreciate you telling me that

373
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:33,770
but why are these other people here what

374
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,970
are they doing why are they doing it why

375
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:36,290
are they trying to share what they've

376
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:37,880
learned is it because they want to stand

377
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:40,880
up here and be able to say hey we'll

378
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:43,820
give me a I'm on stage because I Got

379
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:46,580
News for You is terrifying but public

380
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:47,209
speaking you get up start in your local

381
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:50,240
group

382
00:14:47,209 --> 00:14:53,420
why because this is part of what bill is

383
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,829
you this gives you the room to grow you

384
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:57,170
have to be able to focus on yourself

385
00:14:54,829 --> 00:14:58,790
this way and recognize it normally you

386
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:01,040
go out to an event you talk to some

387
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:02,990
folks it was nice I had some pizza maybe

388
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,599
a little bit of something else you're

389
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:07,429
done you move on and it doesn't mean a

390
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,399
thing to you but what if you stopped and

391
00:15:07,429 --> 00:15:12,290
took a note went out met six new people

392
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,879
maybe you reach out to those people and

393
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:15,740
see what they're doing next weekend or

394
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:17,720
you look for another event where you can

395
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:19,579
connect because that will give you the

396
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,759
opportunity to build the thing you don't

397
00:15:19,579 --> 00:15:24,618
know yet how to do but more than that

398
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:27,800
you have to get exposure to the names

399
00:15:24,619 --> 00:15:30,740
faces companies groups in the area why

400
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:32,300
because you don't know at some point the

401
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:35,569
bridge you build today may be the one

402
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:38,628
that saves your bacon tomorrow you must

403
00:15:35,569 --> 00:15:41,118
take that time you must make that time

404
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:42,290
now there's there's life there's family

405
00:15:41,119 --> 00:15:44,449
there are reasons there are always

406
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:45,679
excuses but this is one of those things

407
00:15:44,449 --> 00:15:47,329
I'm not gonna lie to you you never know

408
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:49,399
when you have to call on these people to

409
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:53,959
move things forward for you because you

410
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:56,749
got stuck or the manager doesn't like

411
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:59,479
you or you got a co-worker who's making

412
00:15:56,749 --> 00:16:03,889
inappropriate something whether it's

413
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:05,299
advances statements work items lighting

414
00:16:03,889 --> 00:16:07,220
things on fire every day and you're

415
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:09,350
having to put them out there are always

416
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:12,439
reasons where it becomes necessary to

417
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:15,649
move ahead or differently or sideways or

418
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:17,449
just out so ask if there are local

419
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:20,379
events and classes that can be taken

420
00:16:17,449 --> 00:16:26,929
when appropriate but more about that is

421
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:29,509
learn how to when we're giving back how

422
00:16:26,929 --> 00:16:31,819
to find things around right see if there

423
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:34,429
are ways in your own workspace that you

424
00:16:31,819 --> 00:16:38,839
can help with the grow because when you

425
00:16:34,429 --> 00:16:40,939
turn out to be the person to ask for

426
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:42,230
help maybe you don't know maybe it's the

427
00:16:40,939 --> 00:16:44,748
willingness to partner with someone on

428
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:47,119
the project maybe you can go and do a

429
00:16:44,749 --> 00:16:49,309
task you normally don't enjoy doing

430
00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:51,290
whatsoever but in so doing you

431
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:52,790
demonstrate your value to others and

432
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:54,410
maybe you help someone else out which

433
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:57,410
means they're willing to help you out in

434
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:58,110
return cool story bro nice you just

435
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:59,640
stand it up there

436
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:01,200
a bunch of slides you'll notice there

437
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,550
are no graphics in this deck because it

438
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,319
turns out the stories are what are

439
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:06,119
important because this is your story and

440
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:11,089
your version of this is different and

441
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:15,659
unique to everybody but I don't know you

442
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:18,928
I've got a pop it's the thing you're

443
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:22,130
talking about That's not me I got bad

444
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:25,290
news it's important to grow past that

445
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:27,480
the time to stop doing that is right now

446
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:29,670
in this room right here tell yourself

447
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:34,200
write it down take a note watch the

448
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:37,200
video email it whatever the point is you

449
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:40,679
must push to level two it's time to

450
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,330
specialize when I got done I showed up I

451
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:43,620
got to go to a meet up and I hung out

452
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:45,270
with a buddy and I'm like why are we in

453
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:47,939
a Thai restaurant with a video projector

454
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:51,360
on Wednesday night he's like because

455
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:53,309
these people are doing cool things what

456
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:57,330
contribution can I possibly make to this

457
00:17:53,309 --> 00:18:00,030
I don't do what they do I am different I

458
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:01,559
have my own thing well it turns out as

459
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:03,000
you choose your major or decide to

460
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:04,950
choose your own adventure and find out

461
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,330
that it's bad to try to pick up the

462
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,620
Babel Fish when it scoots across the

463
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:09,540
floor because you failed to pick up the

464
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:11,489
mail from the porch at the beginning of

465
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:14,460
the game you learned that you might have

466
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:15,809
missed a piece that's an old mmm text

467
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:18,059
adventure from Hitchhiker's Guide to the

468
00:18:15,809 --> 00:18:20,790
galaxy reference for those who may have

469
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:22,110
missed anyway so when you get to that

470
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:23,428
point and you realize you know I've

471
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:25,049
found this thing that really makes

472
00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:26,460
better sense to me I'm gonna have to

473
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:28,110
figure this out I don't usually make

474
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:30,350
direct statements but I believe in being

475
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:33,120
a decent person and there comes a time

476
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:36,360
to explain that being a generalist is

477
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:38,610
okay if you have focused all the way

478
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:41,010
down to only being able to person who

479
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:42,990
lists the bag out of the trash can and

480
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:44,600
that is all you do eventually this will

481
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:48,299
be automated and you will have no job

482
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:51,689
you must in my opinion I don't usually

483
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:53,580
foot stomp but there you go you must be

484
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:57,299
able and willing to be an inch deep and

485
00:18:53,580 --> 00:19:00,570
an ocean across and be willing to dive

486
00:18:57,299 --> 00:19:02,370
in when it's necessary and because for

487
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:04,350
me that's been the ability to adapt and

488
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:06,719
actually build my own career because I

489
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:09,449
am not that

490
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,820
okay I've got stickers on my laptop I'm

491
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:13,830
learning about how to apply patches to

492
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:16,110
my bag but that doesn't mean I know how

493
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:18,810
to break cool things and be all fancy

494
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:21,179
what I do know though is that if you

495
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:23,280
start zeroing in on specific talks and

496
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:25,110
building of progression where you

497
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,879
discover the things you like or the

498
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:29,760
things you're paying attention to you

499
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:32,040
suddenly discover it you have to step

500
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,870
back and recognize that's what's

501
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:36,090
happening see in that very first time I

502
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:37,979
went to b-sides Las Vegas and I had no

503
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:40,409
idea what I was doing and they let me

504
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:42,450
help with track three i sat in a room

505
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:46,020
and sat through talks I would never have

506
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:48,690
chosen for myself that turned out to be

507
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:50,760
the most amazing experience because it

508
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:52,710
showed me things I would never have said

509
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:55,110
if I looked at the list and said what do

510
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:58,350
I want to watch today I would not have

511
00:19:55,110 --> 00:20:01,020
chosen those things and it opened my

512
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:04,320
head not like an actual head wound I

513
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:06,690
know but seriously it gave me I I walked

514
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,740
up to almost every presenter and I'm

515
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:09,720
like that was amazing

516
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,830
I would like to shake your hand cuz I

517
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,410
didn't know what else to do with myself

518
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:14,790
I had no idea what are you what here's

519
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:16,200
my anthea what are you talking about I

520
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:17,550
used a cell phone to go ahead and

521
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,810
trigger this device and then it kicked

522
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:21,840
off this over here and I was halfway

523
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:22,830
around the planet what the video is out

524
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,389
there you can actually go back if you

525
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:26,070
look at the 2011 videos for kids my

526
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,780
anthea you'll see the exact talk that

527
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:29,040
broke my brain and I thought it was the

528
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,570
most amazing thing and the same thing

529
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,399
happened again when I went to DEFCON two

530
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:34,679
years later and saw the guys doing

531
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,720
talking about evil Foca and I met that

532
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,340
person too because I said this is the

533
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,200
most ridiculously amazing thing ever

534
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,820
you can actually break into that machine

535
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,480
doing those things with it but I don't

536
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,220
do that

537
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,320
well what does it mean then I'm on a

538
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:48,990
mission because a year after my first

539
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:51,030
'besides Elvia I went to shmoocon and my

540
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:52,410
mind was completely wrecked because I

541
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:54,480
saw all these things I never knew you

542
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:56,130
could do with a computer and okay fine

543
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,930
but you go to a few of these things

544
00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:00,570
you're like okay I go on a trip and I go

545
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:02,400
to a thing but you need a buddy if you

546
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:05,850
go to one your first big event alone it

547
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:08,880
will be tough if you are like me I need

548
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:09,360
someone to kind of okay let's go where

549
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,610
are we going

550
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,620
breakfast okay well I know how to eat

551
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:14,879
that's not the problem but when it comes

552
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,050
to hey we're going to go out and do this

553
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,270
thing or we're gonna go to see this

554
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,710
challenge I want to see this talk why am

555
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:21,139
i stare

556
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:24,580
in line for an hour why my standing here

557
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:27,890
we're waiting for the next top who cares

558
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:29,510
what you do and you should because at a

559
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:30,830
larger one Ashley attended event there

560
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:33,200
is a much broader cross-section of

561
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:35,899
attendees which means new ideas be

562
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,890
hungry be mentally pac-man B Frogger

563
00:21:35,899 --> 00:21:39,770
whatever it takes

564
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:41,419
you've got to decide that you're hungry

565
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:43,960
and when you're hungry you're willing to

566
00:21:41,419 --> 00:21:46,460
move and take those risks and because

567
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:48,169
you have to go back to the idea of

568
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:50,120
attending with that buddy who's going to

569
00:21:48,169 --> 00:21:52,340
help guide you a little bit at least to

570
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:54,979
get the ropes right figure out where

571
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:56,990
you're headed and when you get closer to

572
00:21:54,980 --> 00:22:00,409
that thing you're going to discover that

573
00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:03,770
you bring back something cool to your

574
00:22:00,409 --> 00:22:06,380
boss no it's not that strange h and AK

575
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:08,299
off i'm talking about the fact that you

576
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,890
can bring back ideas that you saw at

577
00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:12,200
this conference that may be applicable

578
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:14,120
to your actual work life and in so doing

579
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,950
the possible collaboration of other

580
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:18,699
teams who want to implement the

581
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:20,630
protections against the attacks you saw

582
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:23,330
see a lot of these things have been

583
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:25,220
focused around having to step up and

584
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:27,529
this is the next level of that stepping

585
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:30,409
up its level you're just fighting

586
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:33,080
chickens anymore now you're fighting

587
00:22:30,409 --> 00:22:35,179
with I don't know well level funky

588
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:37,010
beasts because you're talking about

589
00:22:35,179 --> 00:22:40,190
getting closer to middle management or

590
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:43,279
at least being seen if you watch the

591
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:45,429
Monty Python Flying Circus they had an

592
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:48,260
entire segment on how not to be seen

593
00:22:45,429 --> 00:22:50,600
this is the wrong talk to be and because

594
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:52,610
this is about moving ahead in your own

595
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,020
career art because in second art you

596
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:55,789
figured out what you want to do and

597
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:57,889
let's work on that because you're going

598
00:22:55,789 --> 00:23:00,470
to stay connected this is the value back

599
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:03,620
to you right the value to management was

600
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:05,090
I'm growing I have value I can do other

601
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:07,639
things that you didn't know I could do

602
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:09,799
before okay terrific what does it give

603
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:12,559
you it gives you now new contacts

604
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:14,629
because hey guess what here's where you

605
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:17,299
have to create a throwaway persona and

606
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:19,789
get on social media this is not the one

607
00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:21,590
you have your gam-gam on is not the one

608
00:23:19,789 --> 00:23:22,680
where you're sharing about this weekend

609
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:24,179
I went to it no you

610
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,620
might share those things with your new

611
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:27,450
conference family because you're gonna

612
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,770
make some you're gonna meet up with

613
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:30,270
these people they're going to become

614
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:31,680
important to you you don't even need it

615
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:33,270
to happen you're like that's not true I

616
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,980
can just throw things away I don't need

617
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:37,080
stuff I don't care but guess what it

618
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:40,290
really does mean something it doesn't

619
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:42,480
come quickly or easily though this is

620
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:44,159
about having to grow up in an industry

621
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,830
and grow your story or to the point

622
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:49,410
where you are going to have to spend

623
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:53,129
real time did you ever play the video

624
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:54,720
game Myst yeah I know I missed yeah did

625
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:56,190
you pull out the pencil on the paper and

626
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,450
start trying to draw out the map because

627
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:59,580
you're like I'm lost in these steam

628
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:03,390
tunnels I don't know where I am

629
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:06,360
yeah right here I didn't want to do that

630
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:08,100
it was that moment of and I had to go

631
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:10,949
find it burn a pencil to go see what I

632
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:13,709
could unearth this is exactly what the

633
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:18,450
problem is we all get to that point that

634
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:22,200
oh and we go home nope thanks I'm good

635
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:26,790
but no no no don't do that to yourself

636
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:28,980
take the step and you said story you

637
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:30,000
don't know me you don't know what I've

638
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,920
been through you don't know how my

639
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,080
challenges are but that doesn't matter

640
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,910
because it's another version of this and

641
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,919
it's a block at every level before the

642
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:39,900
end boss whatever the end boss is

643
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,760
whether it's going out after 6:00 p.m.

644
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,350
and you leave your room again and don't

645
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,690
just order pizza and ice cream to the

646
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:47,219
room and watch reruns of your show that

647
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:50,670
you brought on the streaming device this

648
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:52,590
is about getting past that because you

649
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:54,510
want to get to the prestige class where

650
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:56,129
you start acknowledged and the only way

651
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:58,379
to get there is to figure out you don't

652
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:59,820
know anything once you're aware of the

653
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:01,290
fact that you know nothing or at least

654
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:03,960
have a whole bunch to learn you can then

655
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:09,740
step outside yourself walk up going tug

656
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:09,740
tug tug more and they look down what it

657
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:19,860
gave me to just start moving on

658
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:21,270
what promise do you show you may become

659
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:23,939
the subject matter expert in your field

660
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:25,860
in your area I don't mean the world I

661
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:28,670
mean like locally because there's a lot

662
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,669
of people out there and

663
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:37,459
and it's okay to mess up I wrestle with

664
00:25:34,069 --> 00:25:39,079
this today every day I don't want to

665
00:25:37,459 --> 00:25:41,539
start writing this script because I'm

666
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:43,668
going to get it wrong and it will fail

667
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:46,158
that's my imposter syndrome talking to

668
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:49,069
me and when I do that I let it win and

669
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,989
when it wins I delay I procrastinate and

670
00:25:49,069 --> 00:25:51,918
wind up having in the next weekly

671
00:25:50,989 --> 00:25:53,689
meeting when the light what are you

672
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:56,659
working on this weekend or this week

673
00:25:53,689 --> 00:25:59,449
excuse me uh that that script we talked

674
00:25:56,659 --> 00:26:01,639
about wasn't at last week's work item

675
00:25:59,449 --> 00:26:03,529
but I'm still terrified of it so I

676
00:26:01,639 --> 00:26:04,849
haven't done it yet it might help to

677
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:07,789
think of this as a progression right

678
00:26:04,849 --> 00:26:10,039
let's borrow from some stand-up comics

679
00:26:07,789 --> 00:26:11,779
and presenters grab your hairbrush and

680
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:16,039
get in front of ladies and gentlemen and

681
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:17,739
record yourself time yourself because

682
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:21,859
you were about to have to public speak

683
00:26:17,739 --> 00:26:23,299
when you go to present and you actually

684
00:26:21,859 --> 00:26:26,208
watch yourself for the first time and

685
00:26:23,299 --> 00:26:28,969
realize you turn into Elvis Presley with

686
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:30,739
a podium or you just happen to have that

687
00:26:28,969 --> 00:26:32,959
nervous tic you never saw before that

688
00:26:30,739 --> 00:26:34,189
you just do a thousand times and it

689
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:38,689
turns out you could have been a sign

690
00:26:34,189 --> 00:26:40,849
dancer from Greece or some other popular

691
00:26:38,689 --> 00:26:42,319
something the point is you need to take

692
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:44,718
the long look at yourself and this is

693
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:45,918
the hardest oh my gosh unless you happen

694
00:26:44,719 --> 00:26:48,649
to be in love of yourself and have a

695
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:51,109
paper of yourself in your locker this is

696
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:52,549
hard because now you have to take a look

697
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:54,379
at it see look right now I know I'm

698
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:56,179
being recorded but I'm not going to

699
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:58,039
break the fourth wall because that means

700
00:26:56,179 --> 00:27:00,679
I acknowledge that it's happening and

701
00:26:58,039 --> 00:27:02,209
I'll get even more nervous so instead

702
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:05,419
you have to push through you've all and

703
00:27:02,209 --> 00:27:07,669
when you move on hello Spock I need

704
00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:10,249
answers and that's what we need here you

705
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:13,249
the person to figure out that there is a

706
00:27:10,249 --> 00:27:15,219
speech cadence that makes sense to you

707
00:27:13,249 --> 00:27:18,169
maybe you want to watch your favorite

708
00:27:15,219 --> 00:27:20,209
whodunit show and go to the last five

709
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:22,849
minutes and listen to the way that the

710
00:27:20,209 --> 00:27:26,449
ultra smart impossibly smart the Alex

711
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:28,968
Trebek of the show ever see Jeopardy who

712
00:27:26,449 --> 00:27:32,689
here has watched Alex Trebek on Jeopardy

713
00:27:28,969 --> 00:27:35,569
sound amazingly intelligent when we all

714
00:27:32,689 --> 00:27:37,099
know he has the cards but you know what

715
00:27:35,569 --> 00:27:38,509
that's kind of the thing that we have to

716
00:27:37,099 --> 00:27:41,689
recognize about ourselves again it's

717
00:27:38,509 --> 00:27:42,790
time to step back look at what we're

718
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:45,760
doing and real

719
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:47,139
in many cases we hold the cards if we're

720
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,690
willing to stop and look and see where

721
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:52,960
we are which of the story arcs are you

722
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:55,570
currently in only you can answer it or

723
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,890
you can have a friend buddy up say I'm

724
00:27:55,570 --> 00:28:01,360
looking at this thing and I think I'm

725
00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:04,390
here and though you're still in the

726
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,189
middle mark you're not here yet but can

727
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:09,490
you adjust your timing when you go to

728
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:12,580
present you can do so many things to

729
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:17,830
move through more quickly see like this

730
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:20,199
great thing this mouse to help me move

731
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:22,960
my butt forward because I have a

732
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:25,419
tendency to talk an awful lot but it's

733
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,940
getting the timing right as we move

734
00:28:25,419 --> 00:28:29,679
forward so realize when you're giving a

735
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:31,240
public speaking thing you can go through

736
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,490
a demo but you might want to make a

737
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:35,110
backup and then a backup for that backup

738
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:37,150
I actually carry a small minion with me

739
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:39,219
everywhere I go because it's the backup

740
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:41,890
of my presentation it's actually a

741
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:44,500
rubber USB Drive or it's a well it's a

742
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:46,900
regular USB Drive encased in a little

743
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:48,460
rubber minion object it's incredibly

744
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:50,530
hilarious and he's lost a foot so it

745
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:53,740
looks really violent but the point is he

746
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:55,809
still has my back so now let's get out

747
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:57,549
there and on open mic night at your

748
00:28:55,809 --> 00:29:00,340
local meeting treat it like open mic

749
00:28:57,549 --> 00:29:02,830
night or tacker karaoke yeah we're gonna

750
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:05,230
sing and you need to get out there and

751
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:08,049
present at your local meetup or your

752
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:10,240
b-sides but I don't know what to talk

753
00:29:08,049 --> 00:29:11,620
about what have you been learning what

754
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,720
have you been trying to do what class

755
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:15,790
have you recently done maybe you learned

756
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,230
how to set up your Raspberry Pi for the

757
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:20,230
very first time and you want to do an

758
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:22,840
intro talk they'll listen at the very

759
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:24,549
least you will start to see because you

760
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:26,678
must take that step and get the ball

761
00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:28,750
rolling because as you grow and move

762
00:29:26,679 --> 00:29:30,640
forward you've got to go for it get that

763
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:32,880
talk accepted you've got to polish it

764
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:39,390
and you've got to give it a try it I

765
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:42,910
myself have a lot of trouble getting it

766
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:45,070
well presented many times you got wolf

767
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:48,010
garlic here yes its Kathleen over there

768
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:50,200
and a bunch of other nice folks and

769
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:52,000
they're willing to talk to you usually

770
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,679
if you offer to buy them a coffee or

771
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,710
something you can probably get them to

772
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,659
sit down and chat over whatever

773
00:29:55,710 --> 00:30:00,120
you're looking to learn or at least get

774
00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:04,200
some additional guidance but if you have

775
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:07,590
the ability to present as part of your

776
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:10,230
repertoire the value to management is

777
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:13,470
huge but I don't like presenting I've

778
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:16,320
got bad news this is one of those things

779
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:19,140
that is like the vegetables proverbially

780
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,549
we did not care to eat find a way put

781
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:23,370
them through the blender mash them mix

782
00:30:20,549 --> 00:30:26,639
them up whatever it is because if you

783
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:29,549
can get this one thing and that's not

784
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,309
clickbait this will move everything else

785
00:30:29,549 --> 00:30:34,500
forward as now you start to battle your

786
00:30:32,309 --> 00:30:37,049
inner demons about that fear and the

787
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,820
goal is to represent well by the way

788
00:30:37,049 --> 00:30:46,049
because if you get really good at this

789
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:48,899
and you can talk out loud and see the

790
00:30:46,049 --> 00:30:52,679
people you work for have to know they're

791
00:30:48,899 --> 00:30:56,939
still valuable it's an important little

792
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:59,880
thing it's almost like talking back try

793
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:02,580
to leave some room but always be ready

794
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:04,320
to support that doesn't make sense yet I

795
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:07,080
know it doesn't but if you've done

796
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:09,000
presentations and you maybe leave room

797
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,990
for a question an obvious question that

798
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,840
would give them during the presentation

799
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:14,450
link to answer actually ask a question

800
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:17,189
that you know you have the answer to

801
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:19,049
that sets them up for success and builds

802
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:21,330
them up and by the way that's what this

803
00:31:19,049 --> 00:31:24,330
is really about building yourself up and

804
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:27,240
the people around you because as we work

805
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:29,549
together to start bringing each other up

806
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:32,429
we provide value back to our co-workers

807
00:31:29,549 --> 00:31:34,559
see now you start to get a reputation

808
00:31:32,429 --> 00:31:36,990
potentially if you're agreeable if you

809
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,908
treat others well do we have to go back

810
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:43,980
and look at size dragons talk again look

811
00:31:38,909 --> 00:31:45,539
at ello punks talk about mentorship look

812
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:47,970
at Kathleen's talk about how we learn

813
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:49,320
and how you connect and volunteer why

814
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:51,870
would you do it because you're looking

815
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:54,689
to grow you're looking to build each

816
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:56,399
other up this becomes so important that

817
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:58,020
having presented at a conference may

818
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:00,330
also expand your approach to fixing

819
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:02,070
other things because now you have

820
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:04,320
demonstrated not only your willingness

821
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:05,820
to learn but to learn from others just

822
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,639
because I'm standing here doesn't mean I

823
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:09,330
know anything it means I was willing to

824
00:32:08,639 --> 00:32:11,370
fight

825
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:12,629
battlin stand here and they said we

826
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:16,310
think you've structured it well enough

827
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:19,470
and it's worth sharing that's what it is

828
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:22,200
you know better than I do I bet because

829
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:24,120
what I do is not what you do and the

830
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,910
value back to you is learning that this

831
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:28,379
will help with your self-confidence and

832
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:31,110
deal with job interviews the worst

833
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:33,780
presentation of your life might just be

834
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:35,010
the job interview that in traffic

835
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:36,840
control so I would recommend you

836
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:39,180
practice the interview part and not the

837
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:40,800
air traffic part please not live

838
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:42,090
presenting at conferences puts you into

839
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,340
a new group of people the other

840
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:46,709
presenters those willing to share this

841
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:48,270
grows your personal network and again

842
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:51,000
may give you a new and specific

843
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:52,830
connection hi Kathleen it's so good to

844
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,020
see you again and so many other

845
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:56,730
wonderful people because that now means

846
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:59,460
they become part of your extended

847
00:32:56,730 --> 00:33:02,640
network and again you never know when it

848
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:04,380
becomes helpful to have that insight

849
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,050
because they've seen things you haven't

850
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:09,120
and did we not just say it's important

851
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:10,649
to realize we don't know anything so

852
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,550
we've got to learn from those around us

853
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:13,230
yeah uh-huh

854
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:14,070
okay there's level boss again which

855
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:17,190
means we've reached the end of another

856
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:22,070
arc but you don't know me and I'm afraid

857
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:24,330
I mean I have impostor syndrome right

858
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:26,879
okay fine let's go into the fourth arc

859
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:28,710
it's now your turn DM you decided

860
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,540
somehow that someone convinced you that

861
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:34,410
you should run an event or start

862
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:37,770
something what is wrong with you nothing

863
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:39,750
is it turns out because I and now is my

864
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:43,770
fourth year for coordinating besides San

865
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:45,630
Antonio and it actually changes your

866
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:46,920
perspective about how things happen and

867
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:50,550
people say are you out of your Vulcan

868
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:52,110
mind because this may open the door to

869
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:54,750
bigger things at work and by the way

870
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:57,209
this can opened itself starting last

871
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:59,280
year and I'm on round 2 of that and

872
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:00,750
there's a turns out a corkscrew inside

873
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:04,530
that you as you move up that little

874
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:07,380
level inside the story arc for me I hope

875
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:09,210
yours is different and better it's not a

876
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,440
bad thing it just means that someone's

877
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:12,360
going to come and ask you to help put on

878
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,710
the presentation for some kids and do

879
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,660
you know how to make some lights blink

880
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:16,350
when they see that I'm obsessed with it

881
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:18,060
to begin with

882
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:21,060
see I took off the blinking during the

883
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:24,540
presentation anyway

884
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:27,570
this puts us back to how do we look this

885
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:29,250
at work well now you have a way to build

886
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:31,290
contacts because now you're doing a

887
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:33,360
thing and people want to look for you to

888
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:35,100
give them an opportunity you've suddenly

889
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:37,530
put yourself in the odd position of

890
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:40,920
having something they want whether it's

891
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:43,290
exposure or an opportunity to polish

892
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:45,389
their own skill or they want to learn

893
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:47,370
something from you or get something from

894
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:49,589
you it gives you the room for all new

895
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:51,600
challenges isn't that awesome because

896
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:53,190
you weren't tired enough before but

897
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,810
that's what this is about as you level

898
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:57,330
up and move through that story arc of

899
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:59,640
your career is getting more things that

900
00:34:57,330 --> 00:35:01,890
you can do because you want to grow

901
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:04,020
because staying still means getting

902
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:05,790
stagnant and let me tell you if you have

903
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:09,750
never had the experience of thinking I

904
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:11,790
have arrived I think I'm good I could do

905
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:14,970
this for about 20 years and coast this

906
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:16,470
will be fine and then it all comes

907
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:19,080
crashing down around your ears as you

908
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:21,209
realize no no that doesn't work that's

909
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:23,880
not how that goes and let me tell you

910
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:24,450
I've had that experience and it it's no

911
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,760
fun

912
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:29,129
I know I'm being recorded so we'll just

913
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:30,960
say it's no fun but now what does this

914
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:32,970
do what value to you is there when you

915
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:36,030
start running things well now you have

916
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:38,459
getting help you have to learn about

917
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:41,160
marketing you learn about how to value

918
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:43,620
situations and how to negotiate a little

919
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,100
bit and if you're not good at this get

920
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:47,400
help

921
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:49,290
admit it openly my very first Def Con

922
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:51,390
there was a badge kid that was handed to

923
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:53,880
me and I had to solder something and I

924
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:55,710
said I don't know how to solder and they

925
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:57,750
said well that's not our problem thanks

926
00:35:55,710 --> 00:36:00,810
for the cash move along and I said what

927
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:02,880
do I do now and in my head the way it

928
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:04,620
worked out to me is I took a little walk

929
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,140
over to the hardware hacking village

930
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:11,790
walked in the main room held it up and

931
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:16,529
said I am a dummy and do not know how to

932
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:21,930
solder help in 30 seconds someone a hand

933
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:24,150
shot up in the ocean were here and there

934
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:26,819
was a line of people just like me and

935
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:28,380
this person was helping them so they

936
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,830
could get the electronic badge up and

937
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:33,420
running

938
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:35,520
who does that an amazingly nice person

939
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:37,230
if you ask me but there was the

940
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,000
opportunity again I don't recommend

941
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:41,040
necessarily walking into a crowded room

942
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,319
and shouting something that's your call

943
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,720
but it seems to have worked out okay for

944
00:36:43,319 --> 00:36:47,460
me so far because this is about team

945
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:49,169
building you're gonna have a volunteer

946
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:51,119
army if you try to run something in this

947
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:54,559
level and you must understand how to

948
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:56,849
gently encourage without squashing

949
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:59,309
because if you get angry and you get to

950
00:36:56,849 --> 00:37:01,710
that ragequit moment and you just say

951
00:36:59,309 --> 00:37:04,049
man this is not worth it oh my gosh

952
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:07,099
you can tear the whole thing down I

953
00:37:04,049 --> 00:37:09,569
thought it was called something like I

954
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:11,640
had a weird name I wanted to give it but

955
00:37:09,569 --> 00:37:15,329
someone smarter than me said no no it's

956
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:17,009
kind of a founders syndrome see you

957
00:37:15,329 --> 00:37:18,390
can't you get so into something and you

958
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:20,760
burn out and when you reach that burn

959
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:21,868
out you get to this real other problem

960
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,549
but we'll get there in a second because

961
00:37:21,869 --> 00:37:24,869
again if we look back and say well

962
00:37:23,549 --> 00:37:26,970
that's nice for you to say it's okay to

963
00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:28,380
run something you don't know what I'm

964
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:31,439
going through right now so you can't

965
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:34,099
possibly understand you're right because

966
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:37,170
you're afraid of no one showing up

967
00:37:34,099 --> 00:37:39,059
besides San Antonio is next week this is

968
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:41,970
my fourth year coordinating the event

969
00:37:39,059 --> 00:37:47,339
and we are actually on track to bring in

970
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:49,649
just around 600 people this amazes me I

971
00:37:47,339 --> 00:37:52,470
was handed such an opportunity from

972
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:54,900
someone who did an amazing job and they

973
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:57,209
handed it off to me and I had to start

974
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:59,490
over but we'll get there in a second

975
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:01,380
because we have to talk about burnout if

976
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:04,020
you've gone through all of these things

977
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:05,460
at every one of those level boss moments

978
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:08,880
with the imposter syndrome there's a

979
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:10,470
risk of the beast of burnout and when it

980
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,140
shows up it rears its head you get

981
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:14,848
exhausted too easily you find you're

982
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:18,420
frustrated for no reason

983
00:38:14,849 --> 00:38:19,920
you get I don't care or you shut down

984
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:22,980
and you curl up into a ball and you

985
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:25,589
watch reruns of your favorite show about

986
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:28,740
a thousand times but you look back on

987
00:38:25,589 --> 00:38:30,180
those things give yourself a moment for

988
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,799
the pity party it's gonna happen you

989
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:34,169
can't escape that it's going to come and

990
00:38:31,799 --> 00:38:35,759
it weighs on you like a wet blanket that

991
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:37,260
was out in the Sun and smelt kind of

992
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,980
foul and you're like I don't care I'm

993
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:43,740
gonna sit here and in and then after you

994
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:47,060
kind of realize you're holding on to a

995
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:49,189
moldy blanket and it's rotting you

996
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:51,290
you have to look back at the things that

997
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:54,380
invigorated you in the first place you

998
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:56,840
must revisit those original things

999
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:58,940
because you know what that original

1000
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:02,270
thing that got you interested may just

1001
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:04,850
open a different door seek to reconnect

1002
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:06,830
with the origins of an idea and see if

1003
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:08,750
there's something now further in a

1004
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:10,670
different arc because you're like yeah

1005
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:12,560
but I already did level one I've done

1006
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:15,680
the speed run through Mario whatever

1007
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:17,930
you've done it but you haven't redone it

1008
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:20,629
and when you visit it again later on

1009
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:23,210
it's amazing the things you might miss

1010
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:26,750
whether it's your favorite book a an

1011
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:31,130
inspirational text or maybe just a movie

1012
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:33,830
you've seen a thousand times it can look

1013
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:36,290
for that it can be that time to look for

1014
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:38,960
the people who will now reinvigorate you

1015
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:41,690
the people who still care the people

1016
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:46,730
who's still excited by all of this

1017
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:48,320
madness on Twitter because you've all

1018
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:50,300
opened social media accounts now right

1019
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,680
you've all chosen a name for yourself

1020
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:54,710
because there are a thousand John Steve

1021
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:56,720
Sally's and Susie's but how many sciatic

1022
00:39:54,710 --> 00:40:00,530
nerds are there or fluffy bunnies or

1023
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:03,560
whatever you want to be called make it

1024
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:04,760
yours make it unique but also realize

1025
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,710
there are other people out there who

1026
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:09,380
need you just as much as you need them

1027
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:11,510
and there is a small cadre of them there

1028
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:12,740
aren't enough of them see there was

1029
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:15,770
someone yesterday having a rough time

1030
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:17,689
someone who usually took time to give to

1031
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:20,240
others they didn't necessarily stand

1032
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:23,120
there in the hallway saying hug they

1033
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:25,310
shared their notes they shared their

1034
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:28,670
research they published the information

1035
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:30,680
they got from their classes who does

1036
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:33,050
that someone who's trying to build

1037
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:34,970
community that's it and this person

1038
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:37,250
wants so badly to connect and to

1039
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:38,689
demonstrate their value they would go in

1040
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:42,410
a hundred and ten percent on their

1041
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:44,330
inbuilt reactor and the beast got them

1042
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:48,020
and they burned out and stopped showing

1043
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:49,610
up at all and so I saw it for what it

1044
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:51,470
was and I tried to offer some

1045
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:53,510
encouragement that doesn't mean it's

1046
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:55,220
gonna fix it all of it it just means

1047
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:57,350
take a moment to realize we're not alone

1048
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:59,839
out there don't do this alone this is a

1049
00:40:57,350 --> 00:41:00,650
community for a reason that doesn't mean

1050
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,119
everyone gets along

1051
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:05,180
that doesn't mean there aren't jerks and

1052
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:07,130
messy things this is a Sufi swimming

1053
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:08,629
sometimes you have to go mean that

1054
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:10,520
tastes good today another days it's time

1055
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:12,950
to maybe get the strainer out and try

1056
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:14,390
something else there are always going to

1057
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:18,049
be different things but there are still

1058
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:20,720
valuable learning to be done still you

1059
00:41:18,049 --> 00:41:22,369
have to fight back a wiser friend a

1060
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,558
mentor told me that life is like a way

1061
00:41:22,369 --> 00:41:27,710
know that sometimes you're writing up

1062
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:29,869
the down is coming if you're down you

1063
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:32,210
come back up one way or the other just

1064
00:41:29,869 --> 00:41:34,849
keep riding the wave so that you can see

1065
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:36,859
the next routes now the adventure

1066
00:41:34,849 --> 00:41:38,750
continues don't be afraid to revisit

1067
00:41:36,859 --> 00:41:40,940
this idea as I was talking about earlier

1068
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:43,279
you may unlock something completely

1069
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:45,079
different a yet undiscovered new level

1070
00:41:43,279 --> 00:41:47,599
something you didn't even know about

1071
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:49,730
yourself just like I learned that the

1072
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:52,099
art of noise only existed because the

1073
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:54,529
band yes existed and because the music

1074
00:41:52,099 --> 00:41:55,460
programming needed to get done that

1075
00:41:54,529 --> 00:41:57,770
changed my life

1076
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:59,569
and it took me 30 years to know that

1077
00:41:57,770 --> 00:42:01,640
because when this all started

1078
00:41:59,569 --> 00:42:04,549
liner notes don't exactly share these

1079
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:06,710
stories but to read one article about

1080
00:42:04,549 --> 00:42:09,650
how this person got their start and what

1081
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:10,369
gave them the idea for the band mind

1082
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:12,740
blown

1083
00:42:10,369 --> 00:42:16,910
I would never have put those two things

1084
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:19,339
together but now this brings out that

1085
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:22,430
reflection it takes time to see these

1086
00:42:19,339 --> 00:42:25,038
changes and you don't know which arc

1087
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:26,779
you're in necessarily get someone to

1088
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:29,539
help you from the outside to look in

1089
00:42:26,779 --> 00:42:32,000
have those conversations write it down

1090
00:42:29,539 --> 00:42:33,740
on a piece of use Trillo or some other

1091
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,549
tool that allows you to organize these

1092
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:41,299
things but realize that this impacts

1093
00:42:37,549 --> 00:42:42,680
everything about what you do when you're

1094
00:42:41,299 --> 00:42:44,270
at your job and you're thinking about

1095
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:46,549
the things you want to do and you go to

1096
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:49,190
conferences to pick up that next piece

1097
00:42:46,549 --> 00:42:51,319
of information you bring that back with

1098
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:53,599
you when you get to work on your hobbies

1099
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:55,759
maybe it's someone you ran into here at

1100
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:57,770
Circle City this year maybe it's a Def

1101
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:00,589
Con maybe it's at your local meetup you

1102
00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:02,420
don't know I round up re running into

1103
00:43:00,589 --> 00:43:05,299
someone two months ago

1104
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:08,000
whom I hadn't seen in twenty years and

1105
00:43:05,299 --> 00:43:10,250
they changed my perspective on a few

1106
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,910
things as I got a different side of that

1107
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:13,650
story

1108
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:15,270
so never discount those things you

1109
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:18,869
have to have that sounding board and

1110
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:24,029
honest feedback makes things better

1111
00:43:18,869 --> 00:43:26,760
honest feedback okay sometimes you have

1112
00:43:24,029 --> 00:43:28,980
to tell the person the baby's ugly you

1113
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:32,069
just have to tell them and they're gonna

1114
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:34,230
be angry with you I have a situation

1115
00:43:32,069 --> 00:43:36,420
right now where someone told me that an

1116
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:39,420
idea that I am pursuing at b-side San

1117
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:40,260
Antonio is not to their liking and I had

1118
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:42,809
to say okay

1119
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:45,720
I wrote the email here's a huge tip

1120
00:43:42,809 --> 00:43:48,720
write the email with all of the

1121
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:52,020
frustration that is in your being but do

1122
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:53,609
not hit Send write put tape on the

1123
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:56,400
screen whatever you have to do do not

1124
00:43:53,609 --> 00:43:57,960
hit Send write it out get it out so it

1125
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:01,440
isn't burning a hole through part of you

1126
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:06,450
and then delete it and then go for a

1127
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:07,980
walk maybe a snooze come back now write

1128
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:10,288
the message back that needs to be

1129
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:13,349
written that needs to be said but taking

1130
00:44:10,289 --> 00:44:14,960
into account that this person has their

1131
00:44:13,349 --> 00:44:16,700
perspective they're seeing it from

1132
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,839
anyway

1133
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:21,359
usually it's not easy to hear these

1134
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:24,980
things don't be timid be willing to

1135
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:29,490
respond and explain but this is I

1136
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:30,990
actually my first InfoSec mentor and

1137
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:32,729
there have been many listened to my

1138
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:34,229
stuff and my goals and they offered ways

1139
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:37,319
to achieve them but as they put it I

1140
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:39,089
still had to do the work okay this is

1141
00:44:37,319 --> 00:44:40,890
not easy I've described for you what has

1142
00:44:39,089 --> 00:44:43,470
taken place for me over the course of 18

1143
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:46,859
years this is a version of that story

1144
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:53,669
and if the underperforming kid from

1145
00:44:46,859 --> 00:44:56,009
middle school who hid out in the a/v do

1146
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:58,760
this work and have a career that is

1147
00:44:56,010 --> 00:45:01,619
lasted for 18 years based on it I'm

1148
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:08,809
pretty sure you can make some headway on

1149
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:11,900
your own so cool story you don't know me

1150
00:45:08,809 --> 00:45:13,759
don't worry about that be free

1151
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:16,609
that's okay we're building a community

1152
00:45:13,759 --> 00:45:21,200
together let's help each other grow and

1153
00:45:16,609 --> 00:45:24,680
make it better this is the story of your

1154
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:27,439
career of your adventure please do not

1155
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:30,049
miss out on it it is something you

1156
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:32,890
should not miss and I hope the very very

1157
00:45:30,049 --> 00:45:32,890
best for you

1158
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:52,800
how are we for time got a couple of

1159
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:52,799
minutes are there any questions yes yes

1160
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:00,279
so the question was what happens if

1161
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:02,380
you're writing that angry email that you

1162
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:05,200
plan to delete and accidentally slip and

1163
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:07,660
hit Send if you're using certain online

1164
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:09,779
services there is a four-second undo

1165
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:12,310
I would recommend you use it

1166
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:15,160
alternatively there is such a thing as

1167
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:17,410
the consequences when those moments take

1168
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:20,920
place you must now live with your

1169
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:23,410
actions there is no escaping doing the

1170
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:24,930
work and at some point you either do the

1171
00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:27,399
work or do something else

1172
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:29,589
there's no magic pill to fix when

1173
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:30,880
someone is angry with you I used to try

1174
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:33,610
to do it on the phone I did phone

1175
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,900
support for over a decade and when I'd

1176
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:37,390
be on the phone now there are different

1177
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:39,850
levels of support of course in those

1178
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:42,190
levels and that mix I try to joke to

1179
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:44,319
kind of lighten the mood but when the

1180
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:45,640
customer and you just you're a low

1181
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:48,700
growling from the other end and you

1182
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:50,290
realize that's not gonna fly you have to

1183
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:52,660
figure out another answer and at that

1184
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:55,450
point it becomes yes/no let me get my

1185
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:58,330
supervisor because there's no fixing

1186
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:59,980
that mood there's only addressing so if

1187
00:46:58,330 --> 00:47:01,810
you hit Send on that angry one be

1188
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:05,020
prepared you may have just burned that

1189
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:09,460
bridge and there's no going back you

1190
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:27,960
didn't mean to but it happens and the

1191
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:27,960
other questions yes sir good suggestion

1192
00:47:43,109 --> 00:48:22,890
and that doesn't matter you are pop for

1193
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:24,989
me anybody thank you very much and for

1194
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:27,598
the recording sake the tip that was

1195
00:48:24,989 --> 00:48:29,339
offered was try writing the angry email

1196
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:30,960
in something that isn't your email

1197
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:33,119
editor write it in notepad or something

1198
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:35,269
else and the other comment from the

1199
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:37,680
gentleman from the audience was

1200
00:48:35,269 --> 00:48:39,538
Toastmasters is a great way to break the

1201
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:41,549
ice on learning how to build yourself as

1202
00:48:39,539 --> 00:48:43,470
a presenter learning about manners and

1203
00:48:41,549 --> 00:48:45,779
structure and order it can be a

1204
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:48,149
fantastic competitive adventure all its

1205
00:48:45,779 --> 00:48:51,089
own but it will help with that part of

1206
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:53,190
the journey all right any other

1207
00:48:51,089 --> 00:49:06,029
questions yes sir

1208
00:48:53,190 --> 00:49:08,819
okay sorry yes miss the question was

1209
00:49:06,029 --> 00:49:10,680
have we have I ever suggested someone

1210
00:49:08,819 --> 00:49:13,650
plan them towards therapy as a way to

1211
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:16,319
handle some of or to to work on some of

1212
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:20,700
the impostor syndrome and the answer is

1213
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:22,589
I honestly as a younger person I had a

1214
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:25,259
little bit of therapy and it actually

1215
00:49:22,589 --> 00:49:26,160
was good because it helps you get those

1216
00:49:25,259 --> 00:49:29,279
things out there

1217
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:31,499
it's you're a little in in some ways it

1218
00:49:29,279 --> 00:49:33,539
might be seen as paying someone to ask

1219
00:49:31,499 --> 00:49:36,959
you the hard questions that other people

1220
00:49:33,539 --> 00:49:39,569
are unwilling or unable to ask you to

1221
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:41,519
face about yourself that is a good good

1222
00:49:39,569 --> 00:49:44,339
point there is a group that's called the

1223
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:46,229
mental health hacker village those folks

1224
00:49:44,339 --> 00:49:48,839
will help discuss through some of those

1225
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:51,970
things that's a good idea as well thank

1226
00:49:48,839 --> 00:50:05,259
you very very much for bringing that up

1227
00:49:51,970 --> 00:50:08,919
anything else yes well congratulations

1228
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:08,920
graduate it good for you

1229
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:52,110
certainly good so to me and to repeat

1230
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:54,180
for the recording the question was I

1231
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:57,120
just graduated in a different field I'm

1232
00:50:54,180 --> 00:51:01,350
not in this field in particular and tell

1233
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:03,089
me if I get this wrong but okay so how

1234
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:05,400
do I bring what do I bring to a talk if

1235
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:07,370
I'm coming from outside in and I want to

1236
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:12,960
know what I should start to talk about

1237
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:15,569
so to me since you're asking I believe

1238
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:17,250
the answer lies within whatever it is

1239
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:19,590
that you found interesting or you've

1240
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:21,930
been learning take that for a minute

1241
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:24,000
it's something you discounted because

1242
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:25,169
you've done it a hundred times there's

1243
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,200
someone else who's never done that

1244
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:30,120
whatever that thing is so take that step

1245
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:33,930
back from it look at it and say okay I

1246
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:37,230
just reinstalled whatever was right that

1247
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:39,779
up as your talk it's the framework to

1248
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:41,850
start building from because what you're

1249
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:44,040
doing is trying to learn how to share

1250
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:46,020
information in my opinion how to share

1251
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:47,970
the information and then you're going to

1252
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:50,100
arrive there I had a very similar

1253
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:51,720
experience about six years ago where I

1254
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:52,830
stood in front of the local meetup group

1255
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:56,520
and said I want to talk to you about

1256
00:51:52,830 --> 00:51:58,890
something I have a voice I've got a face

1257
00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:01,170
for radio and a voice that goes with it

1258
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:02,879
so this will be fine and they said you

1259
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:04,230
are not allowed to call yourself dumb

1260
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:06,300
you're not allowed to do this you're not

1261
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:08,460
allowed to do that but we want to hear

1262
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:11,820
from you what have you been doing and it

1263
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:14,340
turns out they're heckling is actually a

1264
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:15,870
form of love in that group I don't know

1265
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:18,840
about the group's you spend time with

1266
00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:21,839
but it turns out that's a silent room is

1267
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:24,630
a bad one engagement is engagement

1268
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:27,950
learning is learning so whether it's

1269
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:30,810
standing up your very first server or

1270
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:33,529
figuring out your very first run on how

1271
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:33,529
to exploit
