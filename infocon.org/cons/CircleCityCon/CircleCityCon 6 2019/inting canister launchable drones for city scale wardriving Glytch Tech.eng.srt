1
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:07,520
hmm okay people are still filtering in

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,520
here so oh wait a minute

3
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:41,370
thank you is that everyone okay so I

4
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:43,050
want to preface this with the fact that

5
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,629
it may seem like I know what I'm doing

6
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,680
I do not may seem like I'm an expert or

7
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:49,079
I've been doing this professionally for

8
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,870
a while I haven't so I kind of just

9
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:54,090
learned everything as I'm going and this

10
00:00:51,870 --> 00:01:02,089
is my first talk so I guess here goes

11
00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:04,140
nothing so today I'm working on

12
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:05,549
presenting 3d printed cameras

13
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,770
neurological drones for city scale or

14
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:10,260
driving or how I got phone calls and

15
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,330
emails from you know defense contractors

16
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:18,119
and added to 18 watch lists and well

17
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:21,450
only part of that is a joke all right

18
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:38,240
this is gonna work first let me

19
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:38,240
introduce air try that one more time

20
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:06,409
please don't ban me thank you okay

21
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,789
Burn Notice references aside I have

22
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:09,709
several names most people know me as

23
00:02:07,789 --> 00:02:11,000
glitch there are no letters before or

24
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:13,849
after that name and I haven't grabbed it

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,709
graduated from MIT yet that said for

26
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:17,268
better or worse people regard me as a

27
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:20,510
knowledgeable person in the fields of

28
00:02:17,269 --> 00:02:22,310
drones robotics and well 3d printing why

29
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,690
well it probably has something to do

30
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:26,000
with the fact that I competed in first

31
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:28,069
FTC and FRC robotics competitions in

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,870
highschool I started building drones in

33
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:32,238
2013 got into 3d printing around the

34
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:34,579
same time designed to devote my first 3d

35
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,900
printed drone in 2014 and have worked on

36
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:37,760
all kinds of ridiculous things since

37
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,349
like the rocket launching robot and the

38
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,380
well rocket launcher you saw in the

39
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:44,209
previous clip yes that robot worked

40
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,560
that wasn't CG they were all you know

41
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:47,780
sitting there firing rockets that drove

42
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,489
around it it was awesome I have more

43
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:53,319
about that and some of my other projects

44
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:55,220
on youtube.com slash glitch and

45
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:56,750
something else I've worked on here this

46
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:59,810
is actually my first drone that I

47
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:01,489
designed in 3d printed and that's kind

48
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:03,260
of what got me started in down the whole

49
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:08,840
line of designing and 3d printing tiny

50
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:11,230
drones okay that's not working so we'll

51
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,230
put that way

52
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:24,600
okay so what am I doing here today

53
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,640
today I'm working on solving problems

54
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,829
and today's problem is mapping and we're

55
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,450
driving at city scale that means finding

56
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:33,390
radius sources such as Wi-Fi access

57
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:35,959
point cellular signals ESS IDs and as a

58
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:38,220
result the people tied to those numbers

59
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:39,600
basically we're doing SIGINT or signals

60
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,370
intelligence but I figured that was too

61
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,079
formal of a term to use in the title so

62
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,030
I'm using more driving as a catch-all

63
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,610
term for the stuff I mentioned above

64
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:49,770
anyway how do we solve this problem well

65
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:51,030
when I see a nail everything is a hammer

66
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:53,370
or at least I could think that's how

67
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,840
that phrase goes a lot of you know that

68
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,010
I have been interested in drones for

69
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,959
several years some of you may be

70
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:00,989
familiar with project cuckoo the Wi-Fi

71
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:03,030
pineapple drone in the top-left as I

72
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:04,890
implies it's carrying a Wi-Fi pineapple

73
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,360
on a 3d printed chassis I design

74
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:08,549
imprinted there's a couple videos on

75
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,900
hack 5 about that it was a project that

76
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:14,250
kind of got a lot of you familiar with

77
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:17,070
me what else here the one in the top

78
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:18,889
right is the endurance oriented modular

79
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:21,418
drone I designed in 3d print set as well

80
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:23,580
it has a flight time of like 25 minutes

81
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:29,210
and it can carry anything from 4k

82
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:33,390
cameras to you know Wi-Fi pineapples

83
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:35,130
raspberry pies and other such things in

84
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:38,159
the bottom left for now in the bottom

85
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:39,960
right that is Scout or no that's Navy

86
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,110
and we just don't talk about Navi that

87
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,810
was not a good project that's an example

88
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:47,870
in failure but you know and then the

89
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:50,430
bottom left that our Scout which is a

90
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,640
folding pocket-sized drone it did all

91
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,289
right

92
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:56,010
there's definitely some improvements

93
00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:57,810
that could be made on that one but for

94
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:59,909
the grammar attempting to cover most of

95
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:02,520
those drones wouldn't do the job we are

96
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:04,950
trying to cover map an entire city in a

97
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,599
matter of minutes and a lot of those

98
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:08,700
drones are just too heavy too large too

99
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,750
expensive to deploy dozens of which is

100
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,370
what we need to do in order to

101
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:14,010
effectively and quickly map at the scale

102
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:16,050
on top of that they lack advanced

103
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:19,530
control options for command control and

104
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:22,320
just generally cooperative

105
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:25,229
sorry one second and just in general

106
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,180
cooperative navigation and mesh

107
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:31,100
networking they just there's no real

108
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,100
software for that in the public sector

109
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:36,900
and a lot of that is necessary for what

110
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,060
we're trying to do we need to have a lot

111
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:53,820
of drones working together in a very

112
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:56,040
rapidly deployable way so now rapidly

113
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:58,169
deployable drones do exist but a lot of

114
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,850
them cost two to ten times what I make

115
00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:01,710
in a year this is the part where I joke

116
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:04,980
about supporting my patreon no please I

117
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:07,320
need to eat not only our rapidly

118
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:08,760
deployable drones that exist expensive

119
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,620
but if you would like that year selling

120
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,090
the worth of trying to explode in a ball

121
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,930
of fire and shrapnel that'll cost more

122
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:18,119
about three times more yes I checked up

123
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:20,400
here we have the aerovironment

124
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,320
switchblade this gets deployed from a

125
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,620
little backpack mount our back area

126
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:28,020
Bulow and that is the $70,000 one that

127
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:30,780
explodes and it is really cool

128
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:32,370
technology but you know I not in the

129
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:35,789
business of killing people so we're

130
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:38,000
trying to find people not kill them the

131
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:42,240
other drone down here is the Raytheon

132
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,910
coyote and it gets launched from tubes

133
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,790
as well in the picture there you see a I

134
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:49,340
think that's a p3 Poseidon sub hunter

135
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:51,720
aircraft that got repurposed for

136
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:53,159
hurricane hunting and they will actually

137
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,380
fly through hurricanes deploy these

138
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,030
drones and get even more data and info

139
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:00,030
and coverage from the drummer from the

140
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:03,320
hurricane and you can also make those

141
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:03,320
blow up too with an optional warhead

142
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:07,960
now the cool thing about those drums is

143
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:10,300
they can also be deployed in a swarm

144
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:19,150
fashion the problem is you need a

145
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:26,110
semi-trailer to do so the internet here

146
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:29,229
is gray so here you can see it being

147
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:32,349
deployed from a trailer mounted assembly

148
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:35,370
and the other option is to deploy them

149
00:07:32,349 --> 00:07:37,960
FRA is to deploy drones from an f-16

150
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:39,939
this is the perfect swarm it is one of

151
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,370
the largest and most recognized drone

152
00:07:39,939 --> 00:07:43,629
swarm projects currently being developed

153
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:45,189
by DARPA

154
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:47,889
these are little drones that get

155
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:50,050
deployed out of flare tubes on a an f-16

156
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:52,270
fighter jet and actually assembled and

157
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:54,069
deployed 100 of these and you can see

158
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:56,889
this is a sped up clip here just for

159
00:07:54,069 --> 00:07:58,719
brevity but they will circle around the

160
00:07:56,889 --> 00:08:00,490
points on the left navigate to a point

161
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:11,469
in the middle and then to a point on the

162
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:15,940
right and after this

163
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:17,680
from the ground and these are with zoom

164
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,910
lenses professional photographers trying

165
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,310
to get video in picture these these are

166
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:22,840
the most InFocus Clips I could find this

167
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:25,990
gives you an idea of just how hard it is

168
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:27,130
to detect these things and now you can

169
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:28,420
imagine trying to shoot these down with

170
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:34,030
something like a battle rifle or

171
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:35,409
something you don't you just hide while

172
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:39,909
we're talking about defense contractors

173
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:41,319
and lighting money on fire let's get

174
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:42,729
back to that subtitle for a moment

175
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,200
despite publicly expressing my

176
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:47,200
disinterest time and time again about

177
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,640
working on defense projects and just

178
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,590
wanting to work on search and rescue

179
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,240
I've gotten multiple six-figure job

180
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:54,130
offers from defense contractors I'm not

181
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,660
going to give the privilege of naming as

182
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:58,810
well as dozens of other emails and calls

183
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:00,969
from interested parties and while that's

184
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:01,510
great and all and I can definitely use

185
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:03,730
the money

186
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:06,430
who here is played call of duty black

187
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:12,580
ops 2 so you probably know where I'm

188
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:18,160
going with this this is the hunter

189
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:18,800
killer drone from that game and a lot of

190
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,219
my end

191
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,540
for the drum that you'll see later is

192
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:27,200
derived from this from the aesthetics of

193
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:29,300
this now the reason I declined those

194
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,250
aforementioned job offers is because why

195
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:33,319
not excel in such fields I don't want to

196
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:41,660
contribute to this problem and I'll use

197
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:43,130
all the swarm there so what can we do to

198
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:47,089
avoid getting involved with those

199
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:48,350
faceless Megadeth corpse well we can

200
00:09:47,089 --> 00:09:50,029
make them not explode for starters

201
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:52,220
making them recoverable and reusable

202
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:53,660
would be good quiet in them down by

203
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,829
ditching three of the rotors would also

204
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:58,250
make them lighter and cheaper as well

205
00:09:54,829 --> 00:09:59,660
and we can also use off-the-shelf parts

206
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,040
to further reduce the cost like these

207
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,529
open-source flight controllers from

208
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,870
omnibus and Talon

209
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:09,380
those run einav an open-source drone

210
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:12,290
firmware and also we could make them

211
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:15,980
rapidly deployable via grenade launchers

212
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:17,360
I mean it's a co2 powered grenade

213
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,250
launcher meant for airsoft but it's

214
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,230
still a grenade launcher this will

215
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:23,540
subject the drones to less g-forces than

216
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:25,370
their gunpowder counterparts and also

217
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:27,529
cost substantially less and you don't

218
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:29,180
need the tax stamp for each shell it

219
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:31,430
costs over two hundred and fifty dollars

220
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:33,050
and it only applies to that one shell so

221
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:34,989
once you've fired it it's gone you're

222
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:37,099
literally setting money on fire

223
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:38,510
anyway the airsoft version of the m30

224
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,339
two rotary grenade launcher could

225
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:41,779
theoretically launch six drones as fast

226
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:43,339
as you can pull the trigger though you

227
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:44,720
need to allow for some time so that

228
00:10:43,339 --> 00:10:46,850
drones don't collide into each other on

229
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,579
deployment so six drones in 10 seconds

230
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:50,600
is feasible the other advantage of a

231
00:10:49,579 --> 00:10:51,979
grenade launcher that might not be

232
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,450
readily apparent is that you are

233
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:55,190
skipping one of the most energy

234
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:57,079
consuming phases of flight and that is

235
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:59,540
the launching or the deployment and

236
00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:01,339
climb out to getting to altitude and

237
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:04,010
whatnot and this is critical because

238
00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:05,329
these a small Vedran we're using we

239
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:07,339
don't really have room for a lot of

240
00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:11,870
batteries so avoiding costly phases of

241
00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:12,170
flight is desirable so what else can we

242
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,209
do

243
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:15,680
how about modular payloads obvious

244
00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:18,109
sensors include cameras like normal

245
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,120
daylight cameras or even thermal which

246
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,709
here's a cool thing this is a picture I

247
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,630
took with a side project a couple of

248
00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:26,000
years ago they uses a relatively cheap

249
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:27,320
FLIR lepton sensor it's a person

250
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,730
standing over 200 feet away and

251
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,990
pitch-black and you can see them

252
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:32,850
perfectly and the ambient temperature

253
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,529
eighty-eight degrees Fahrenheit so it's

254
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:36,300
not all that different from you know

255
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:38,070
body temperature and yet they stand out

256
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:42,060
perfectly you can obviously make them

257
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:43,589
out but you all aren't here to see

258
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,119
another camera drone there's plenty of

259
00:11:43,589 --> 00:11:46,500
those around let's talk about something

260
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,240
other than visual spectrum like the

261
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,310
radio spectrum things like Wi-Fi

262
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,950
Bluetooth and cellular and just RF in

263
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:55,380
general everyone recognizes these right

264
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:56,910
this is the stingray that was everywhere

265
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,620
in the news a few years ago violating

266
00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:00,270
your privacy it can operate in both

267
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:02,430
active and passive modes so you couldn't

268
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:03,660
even tell it was there you know what

269
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,399
else can do some passive Jing of some

270
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:07,230
sniffing this one inch-long

271
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:08,730
software-defined radio dongle that can

272
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:10,470
connect to a tiny single board computer

273
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:12,870
all of which can fit in a grenade sized

274
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:14,430
route now one would think that would be

275
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:17,339
a really expensive and advanced advanced

276
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:20,219
piece of equipment right wrong it's 2995

277
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:23,160
on Amazon oh and look free one-day

278
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:24,660
shipping so that's cool but what else

279
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,939
can we track and monitor with hardware

280
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:28,770
like this what about pagers who uses

281
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,600
those anymore right well hospitals and

282
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:34,350
emergency response teams pretty critical

283
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:37,020
things baby monitors need i say more of

284
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:38,520
those just creepy and here's a fun one

285
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,839
tire pressure sensors in the wheels of

286
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,880
most modern cars have unique identifiers

287
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,860
that are beaconed out constantly and

288
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:47,310
thus can be used to track your movements

289
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:49,080
around the city and as for Wi-Fi well

290
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:50,550
that's an easy one that same single

291
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:53,040
board computer equipped with a Wi-Fi

292
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:54,839
dongle rather than an SDR could run

293
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,459
something called creepy doll Brendan

294
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:58,589
O'Connor gave a talk called stalking the

295
00:12:56,459 --> 00:13:01,439
city for fun and frivolity at DEFCON 21

296
00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:03,150
and he discussed his work on it as he

297
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,440
said it's a distributed sensor network

298
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:07,079
that combines wireless sniffing and

299
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,850
distributed command and control to do

300
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,920
real-time personnel tracking and true

301
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:13,620
identity theft on a major urban area it

302
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,270
is stalking as a service now that sounds

303
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,279
like a lot of what we're trying to do

304
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:18,900
but without deploys they without

305
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:25,500
deploying dozens or hundreds of boxes

306
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:27,029
we're going to give our boxes wings now

307
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,620
this is the wasp drone designed and

308
00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:30,870
built by people over at the rabbit-hole

309
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:32,700
I remember this being one of the first

310
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:34,020
drone projects I had ever seen and it is

311
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,510
quite possibly what got me into drones

312
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:38,850
and InfoSec it had me hooked it was a

313
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:41,370
uses a little via single board computer

314
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:43,890
and an old-school at a software-defined

315
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:45,420
radio some wireless and Wi-Fi cards

316
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:47,370
some other hardware and to my ta

317
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,930
yourself it was just so cool never mind

318
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:50,700
the fact that it has a six foot wingspan

319
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:53,760
and was bright yellow and could be seen

320
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:55,769
for miles but as cool is is it's a

321
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,920
decade old now and by the way it's on

322
00:13:55,769 --> 00:14:00,029
display at the International Spy Museum

323
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,189
that said I think it could use some

324
00:14:00,029 --> 00:14:05,130
modernization a new drone for a more

325
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:07,350
civilized era now this is work I've done

326
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:10,230
in the as I mentioned earlier it is the

327
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:12,089
canister or is the project kuku and it

328
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:15,050
carries a Wi-Fi pineapple 3d printed

329
00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:17,010
chassis you can also plug in

330
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:19,500
software-defined radios Bluetooth

331
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:21,689
dongles has a low-light camera over 20

332
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:25,110
minutes flight time and it can be made

333
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:27,329
relatively cheaply but I think we can do

334
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:28,740
better and even smaller yet introducing

335
00:14:27,329 --> 00:14:30,449
what you've all been waiting for the 3d

336
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,370
printed canister launch drone or at

337
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:40,380
least the first version of it as you can

338
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:42,180
see from this cat animation I had some

339
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,829
rather optimistic ideas about those tail

340
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:45,510
surfaces I'm still working through the

341
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:47,069
problems and making them making 3d

342
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:55,800
printed deployable fins on this small to

343
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:57,570
scale and as you can see here it doesn't

344
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,349
need fit in a 40 millimeter airsoft

345
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:00,029
grenade launcher

346
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:01,829
notice how the fins don't fold and the

347
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:02,630
prophets also rigid it was a work in

348
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:04,920
progress

349
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:07,380
these are proving to be the biggest

350
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:11,819
hangups with this project and the former

351
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:15,390
more so than the latter and if you look

352
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:18,720
here all of the avionics fit on a single

353
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:20,010
little slide end shim everything from

354
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,839
the servos flight controller motor

355
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:23,399
controller RC receiver and even the

356
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,199
motor are all connected to this one pod

357
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:26,490
the only thing missing is the battery

358
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,550
and that would go in the nose of this

359
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:31,199
design I was pretty proud of how this

360
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:32,519
all worked out until I did the math on

361
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,779
how much it weighed and how fast it

362
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:35,579
would have to fly in order to stay

363
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:37,019
airborne yeah it wasn't pretty

364
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:43,819
oh my battery's running low that's

365
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:45,620
lovely it weighed me

366
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:47,750
50 grams and would have to had

367
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:51,320
maintained over 55 miles an hour to just

368
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:52,310
not stall and fall out of sky it made

369
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,780
over two times to us the

370
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:55,099
thrust-to-weight ratio so I was pretty

371
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:56,449
confident could do it but it seemed

372
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,460
pretty ridiculous and quite frankly

373
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:59,960
scary to test excuse me one moment I

374
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:38,290
need to plug my laptop in or this stuff

375
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:45,779
will not get finished I don't think

376
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:47,439
turn back on I think we're done here

377
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:49,030
well the problem is

378
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:53,740
laptop will not turn on unless the

379
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:55,420
battery has 15% charge in it yeah so it

380
00:16:53,740 --> 00:17:06,120
is now dead and it will not turn back on

381
00:16:55,420 --> 00:17:06,119
for probably another 25 minutes so yes

382
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:26,470
we absolutely could us PC or even just a

383
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:32,680
laptop I do apologize used a lot more

384
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:38,170
battery than I thought would say that

385
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:39,610
again right I believe they have two

386
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:45,300
hours of run time because they had a lot

387
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:45,300
of battery in that the wasp that was I

388
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:48,699
don't know the range on it right off I

389
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:52,899
think they said something like a couple

390
00:17:48,700 --> 00:18:01,600
of miles thank you

391
00:17:52,900 --> 00:18:08,460
we're kind of saying it ok I'll be

392
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:08,459
changing it shortly after yeah thank you

393
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,029
well okay

394
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:44,199
that's good on it I think I think it's

395
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,200
rugged

396
00:18:54,220 --> 00:19:00,080
thank you my I can just put this back on

397
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:08,990
yeah yes

398
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:12,439
we'll get the post I won't actually be

399
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:14,300
able to do it so I will have to throw

400
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:23,180
out the demo where then what gods are

401
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:27,550
not with me today do you want to set up

402
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:42,590
the and can I do you extended display

403
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:46,550
mind notes well okay I just need to

404
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:49,030
track something over okay thank you do

405
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:49,030
apologize

406
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:24,270
third full-screen the sort of men are

407
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:24,270
okay

408
00:20:27,649 --> 00:20:34,158
talked about the pagers baby monitors

409
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:39,090
creepy tall wasp my stuff and we are

410
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:42,180
back here show must go on

411
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:42,179
[Applause]

412
00:20:43,899 --> 00:20:48,709
okay as I was saying I didn't I was

413
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:51,440
pretty proud of how this was all coming

414
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:51,919
together I did went and did the math on

415
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,870
it though

416
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:57,399
and it wasn't pretty it weighed over

417
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:59,899
nearly 150 grams and we would require to

418
00:20:57,399 --> 00:21:02,928
maintain a speed of over 55 miles an

419
00:20:59,899 --> 00:21:06,139
hour to stay flying which is a scary

420
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:08,029
thing to test so this is the current

421
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:11,418
version and I have it actually right

422
00:21:08,029 --> 00:21:14,720
here and it is absolutely tiny it weighs

423
00:21:11,419 --> 00:21:16,940
in at just 85 grams and is a bit over

424
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,740
half the weight of the first version I

425
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:21,409
think there's room to shed more weight

426
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:22,909
yet and get it under 80 grams it uses a

427
00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:24,769
lower voltage battery so it doesn't make

428
00:21:22,909 --> 00:21:26,570
quite as much thrust but it still has

429
00:21:24,769 --> 00:21:28,220
around a one point one to one to one

430
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:30,649
thrust to weight ratio which put simply

431
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:32,809
is excessive for most aircraft it could

432
00:21:30,649 --> 00:21:35,748
literally climb vertically as long as

433
00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:38,299
the atmosphere was thick enough this

434
00:21:35,749 --> 00:21:43,970
design will also have some rips nylon or

435
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:45,649
Tyvek in these areas here and that will

436
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:47,929
make it have some more wing area and

437
00:21:45,649 --> 00:21:49,279
reduce the wing loading and which will

438
00:21:47,929 --> 00:21:50,659
further reduce the stall speed or the

439
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:52,249
minimum speed at which the drone needs

440
00:21:50,659 --> 00:21:54,679
to fly in order to not fall out of the

441
00:21:52,249 --> 00:21:56,629
air now as I'm sure you all notice that

442
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:58,309
the version two isn't round like the

443
00:21:56,629 --> 00:22:00,168
first one which you might think doesn't

444
00:21:58,309 --> 00:22:01,908
lend itself well to being launched out

445
00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:03,710
of a grenade launcher no worries because

446
00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:10,549
a simple discarded subo like the ones

447
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:13,190
tanks use like the ones thank you thanks

448
00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:15,168
yous I will take care of that and the

449
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:16,610
other advantages of using a sub ohm will

450
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:20,629
add protection during transport

451
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:22,008
protection during launch and it will

452
00:22:20,629 --> 00:22:24,139
just prevent the body of the drone from

453
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:26,149
making contact at the barrel going this

454
00:22:24,139 --> 00:22:27,769
drew this route lets the drone have a

455
00:22:26,149 --> 00:22:30,600
substantially slimmer profile while

456
00:22:27,769 --> 00:22:32,190
flying and reduces drag and

457
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:35,909
prevents wind from pushing the dren

458
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:37,110
around quite as much this particular

459
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:39,960
drum currently has a thermal camera

460
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:43,080
equipped with a 5.8 gigahertz video

461
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,640
transmitter in it and I was going to say

462
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,899
if I were to attempt the demo gods but

463
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,970
I've already tempted them and they got

464
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:49,680
angry so we won't be able to do my demo

465
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:51,690
today showing the thermal camera in

466
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:56,490
action I just imagine a bunch of little

467
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:58,730
white dots in the audience and what else

468
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:58,730
here

469
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,969
the thermal camera could easily be

470
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:05,160
replaced with a normal daylight camera

471
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:06,720
or using a little remote video switcher

472
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,880
circuit I could even use both thermal

473
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,680
and daylight and to switch as needed

474
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,200
well in flight alternatively

475
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:15,090
alternatively as I've been alluding to

476
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,560
since the beginning the cameras and

477
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:18,530
video transmitter could be replaced all

478
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:20,340
together by a single board computer and

479
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:22,590
can be used in conjunction with

480
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:24,270
software-defined radios Wi-Fi cards and

481
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:26,520
combined with software like creepy at

482
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:28,740
all and some c2 software that provide

483
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:30,240
GPS waypoints for the drums to do some

484
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,040
pretty scary City Ride tracking and

485
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,440
surveillance for not a lot of money

486
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:37,050
depending on the exact payload and part

487
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:40,140
sourcing if you were able to bolt order

488
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:44,820
parts you could do as little as $100 per

489
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:46,980
drone and substantially less if you're a

490
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:49,980
running a big operation and have the

491
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:52,140
purchasing power to buy parts in bulk so

492
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:53,760
why am I talking about all this well I'm

493
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,230
23 self-taught and have been playing

494
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,840
with hardware like this as a hobby on

495
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:59,790
and off on an extremely restricted

496
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,139
budget for about six years if I can do

497
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:02,460
it and share it with you all that raises

498
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,500
questions about what is being done

499
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:05,910
buying closed doors just like Brendan

500
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,990
O'Connor said in his talk I mentioned

501
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:08,970
earlier sunlight is the best

502
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:10,470
disinfectant the more like we shed on

503
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:12,390
the problem the sooner we realize we

504
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:13,980
need to address it until then I plan to

505
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:15,300
use these flaws in technology we rely on

506
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:19,200
in our everyday lives

507
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:21,090
to try and help save some lives so when

508
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,010
I was 13 I relative of mine was on a

509
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:24,780
winter hunting trip he slipped and fell

510
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:26,570
down a steep hill breaking his ankle and

511
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:29,010
got knocked unconscious at the bottom

512
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:30,210
when he did not return as expected a

513
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,800
group of family and friends went out

514
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:33,390
searching for him he was found alive

515
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:36,000
after many hours with severe throat

516
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:37,530
frostbite but later that evening he

517
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,720
succumbed to complications of frostbite

518
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:41,460
and passed away in the hospital well I

519
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,300
wasn't personally close to him I saw

520
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,710
what it did to my family

521
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,840
I wanted to solve that problem to help

522
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:49,320
prevent more lives being lost and more

523
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,459
tragedy as such the good thing is I'm

524
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,120
not the only one thinking about these

525
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,530
problems

526
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,209
drones are already being used around the

527
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:56,160
world to help save lives finding people

528
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:57,900
on frozen lakes elderly who get lost in

529
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,850
the woods or fields as a result of

530
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,770
dementia or someone who just lost their

531
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:02,639
way in some marshes all without putting

532
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:05,550
more lives at risk

533
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,170
that's what drums are good for but as is

534
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:09,270
it's not good enough according to the

535
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:10,770
National Park Service over 46,000 people

536
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:14,550
went missing within a 10-year period

537
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:15,629
spanning 2004 to 2014 nearly 1,600 of

538
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:17,129
them were not found quick enough

539
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:20,040
resulting in their deaths and many

540
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:21,870
family tragedies and yes I said National

541
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,730
Park Service because this is just within

542
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:25,889
national parks inside the United States

543
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:27,150
I could not find how many search and

544
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:29,250
rescue operations happen throughout the

545
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:30,480
entire nation let alone globally so you

546
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:33,840
can imagine this number is much much

547
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,670
larger so obviously some things still

548
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,990
need to improve I hope some of the ideas

549
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:38,340
and thoughts I put forward today will

550
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:40,110
someday help prevent someone's family

551
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:42,360
going through the same experiences as

552
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:44,790
mine whether it's using Wi-Fi and cell

553
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:46,590
phone monitoring to detect beacons from

554
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:49,050
someone's phone without service and a

555
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:50,280
natural disaster recovery or swarm of

556
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:52,260
drones with sensors of all types

557
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:54,750
deployed from the back response vehicles

558
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:56,370
I do think drones are not only here to

559
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:57,870
stay but will become more common and

560
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:59,699
with a little luck and some improvements

561
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:01,860
to drones and the data collection

562
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:05,700
systems they need hopefully it'll be for

563
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:07,770
the right reasons anyway that's about

564
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:14,460
all I had it would still have a few

565
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:16,920
minutes are there any questions yes not

566
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:18,720
yet I'm trying to find a folding

567
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:21,090
propeller that is of a small enough size

568
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,580
I have yet to find one that is a three

569
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:26,129
inch and folds in the way I need most

570
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:28,740
quadcopter propellers fold this way I

571
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:30,720
need it to fold back this way and so

572
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:32,820
what I'm looking at is probably having

573
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,710
one SLS printed with shape waves out of

574
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:38,189
nylon or something FDM printing won't

575
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:41,000
work this motor spins at 33,000 rpm yeah

576
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:41,000
go ahead

577
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:47,130
I don't know three different scene out

578
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:49,650
of carbon fiber you can get carbon fiber

579
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:51,210
impregnated filament but I don't know if

580
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:53,540
Shapeways has that I will have to look

581
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,540
into that

582
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:08,460
any other questions okay that should do

583
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:09,750
it for me I would like to thank you all

584
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,430
for coming to my first ever talk I

585
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:12,780
apologize for the earlier complications

586
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:15,300
and it looks like we ran a little short

587
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:16,860
as well there are some links on screen

588
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:19,260
where you can find out more about what I

589
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:22,070
do keep an eye on my projects and feel

590
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:22,070
free to reach out to me on Twitter
