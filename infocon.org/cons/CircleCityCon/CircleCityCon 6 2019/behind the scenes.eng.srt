so what do you want to know about why do

111
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,629
you keep putting it this is a six year

112
00:07:21,289 --> 00:07:26,479
so this is our sixth year here's the

113
00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:27,860
thing about six years ago a group of

114
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,300
people in Indianapolis thought it would

115
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,219
be cool to have a conference but here's

116
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:34,129
the thing we've never really had a

117
00:07:31,219 --> 00:07:35,300
security industry in Indianapolis like

118
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:37,039
you know like industry events and

119
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,719
everything like that but we wanted to

120
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,060
make it happen so a group of guys in

121
00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:43,190
Chicago came down and they helped us get

122
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,930
some some stuff started up and then a

123
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,580
group of people from Michigan came down

124
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:48,560
was like we'll give a bunch of talks and

125
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:50,659
it's the people whom Missouri came over

126
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,340
like we'll give some talks and we had

127
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:54,349
gear one of several city cop first year

128
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:56,000
class in Louisville came to yeah we had

129
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:57,620
a lot of people from let you came up

130
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,029
from Louisville as a matter of fact when

131
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,740
you you were the one who did our video

132
00:07:59,029 --> 00:08:02,690
for the first year circuit city cop

133
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:04,430
which the thing after that first year

134
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:06,500
wrapped up everybody's like man that was

135
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:08,479
a lot of fun do you think we can do it

136
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,419
again and sure we did

137
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:13,250
that's gear too but after year two we

138
00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:15,469
learned a little more glue a little more

139
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:17,719
like can we do it again bands now we got

140
00:08:15,469 --> 00:08:20,180
your three here's the thing six years

141
00:08:17,719 --> 00:08:21,740
later we've grown every year we've

142
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,599
learned every year we've actually become

143
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:26,270
a stable conference which is something

144
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:28,460
we're particularly proud about and what

145
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:30,440
I mean by stable conferences we have

146
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:33,140
consistent training we have consistent

147
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,849
speakers to speak on not high-level

148
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:36,289
security things but security thinks

149
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:38,390
everybody can get around

150
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:40,549
everybody knows the topics that our

151
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:42,799
speakers speak about and they're very

152
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:45,020
good at conveying that information to

153
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:47,000
the wider public you don't have to be a

154
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:49,189
security expert to understand what our

155
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,399
speakers are talking about we take great

156
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:54,630
pride in this and so I am particularly

157
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:57,630
proud of Circle City cars for a car

158
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:59,430
this in six years you know we've done

159
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:02,220
six cons and we're already pretty much

160
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:03,959
like exactly where we wanted to be from

161
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,670
your watch and honestly that's

162
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,380
phenomenal a lot of countries just take

163
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,880
a lot of time to get where we are so I'm

164
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,220
proud of the fact that we've done this

165
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,630
but one of the things I've always said

166
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,830
about Circle City condors we're known
