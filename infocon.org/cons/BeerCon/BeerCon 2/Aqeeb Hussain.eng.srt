1
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,160
okay welcome back uh we hope we have a

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,200
pleasant lunch

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,840
and and stuff like that uh a break or a

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,120
walk or whatever

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,120
um it gives us great pleasure to welcome

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,519
akib to start off the afternoon session

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,840
um welcome mccabe you're going to talk

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,640
to us about

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,640
well hacking really and getting

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,240
footholds and targets and that kind of

11
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:22,880
stuff so

12
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,720
without any further ado with you akeeb

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,359
yes so hello everyone uh my name is akib

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,320
hussein

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,200
and uh as mike has introduced uh today

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,559
we're going to be talking about

17
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,840
the first steps of gaining an initial

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,960
foothold

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,399
on your target so let's make a stop

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,600
so just a quick who am i um so

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,079
as mentioned i'm aki busan i study in

22
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,840
northumbria university

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,239
i'm doing a masters of computing in a

24
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,480
computer network cyber security

25
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,800
and my background is mainly in linux

26
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,680
technologies

27
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,640
so i've done year of industry have dealt

28
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,039
with

29
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,040
different types of um linux distros

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,799
most of my interests are in offensive

31
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,880
security penetration testing

32
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,240
and that's kind of what we're going to

33
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,640
be looking at today as to

34
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,479
you know how to gain a foothold and

35
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,479
look at the the red team aspect of it

36
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,400
all

37
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,040
so just before we get really get into

38
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,720
the presentation i just want to

39
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,720
go over a quick plan of um what's going

40
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,840
to happen so

41
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,000
first of all going to talk about um how

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,040
to gain a foothold

43
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,640
on your target and then moving on to

44
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,960
some actual tools that you could use and

45
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,880
some actual techniques

46
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,960
and from that point we're then going to

47
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,240
be looking at

48
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,240
um some considerations you should make

49
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,320
when you're gathering information

50
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,040
and once all the talking's done i'm then

51
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,000
going to show a

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,840
live not a live but a pre-recorded

53
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,159
demonstration

54
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,200
which is um going to showcase some tools

55
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,799
and actually talk about the different

56
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,119
approaches which i'll be theoretically

57
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,479
talking about first

58
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,560
also got a slide at the end for anybody

59
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,520
who kind of

60
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,759
wants to know a bit more pick up some

61
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:08,959
more tricks

62
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,599
and um you know maybe learn some new

63
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,840
things so let's get down to it

64
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,080
so to start off what is an initial

65
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,200
foothold

66
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,920
well to introduce an initial foothold i

67
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,720
first of all want to

68
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,200
discuss the image on the left which is a

69
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,599
what we call a cyber kill chain

70
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,040
now created by lockheed martin in 2016 i

71
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,680
think

72
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,400
um also referred to as the intrusion

73
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,760
kill chain

74
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,480
it's basically a set of steps which an

75
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,080
advanced persistent threat or an

76
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,840
advanced attacker would use

77
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,200
to exploit a system now when it comes to

78
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,720
gaining a foothold the first

79
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,480
kind of step would be reconnaissance and

80
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,200
that's where gaining a foothold is

81
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,000
so what we sometimes call recon that's

82
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,159
the shortened version for reconnaissance

83
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,200
um in practical terms recon consists of

84
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,480
a few things

85
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,640
um such as you know looking for open

86
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,599
services

87
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,400
which you can exploit as an attacker um

88
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,840
versions of software

89
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,120
so outdated versions updated versions um

90
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,879
port numbers which are open maybe

91
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,239
filtered and

92
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,599
that then helps us to map out any

93
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,840
potential vulnerabilities

94
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,120
so then moving on to detecting services

95
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,000
so you first of all got port numbers

96
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,519
you've got the versions

97
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,120
now you need to move on to the next step

98
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,280
so you're detecting the services

99
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,840
you're probing them with certain packets

100
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,000
and then that helps you to move on to

101
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,200
the next step

102
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,400
which would be exploitation now i know

103
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,239
within the diagram you see in

104
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,319
weaponization and delivery

105
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,040
but when you're dealing with network

106
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,840
devices

107
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,159
such as maybe servers so we're talking

108
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,480
remote servers email servers

109
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,720
the weaponization and delivery steps

110
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,400
kind of get wrapped into

111
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,879
the exploitation phase because it

112
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:01,920
depends on

113
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,840
what payload you've got and how you

114
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,959
decide to deliver that

115
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,280
so i haven't really gone into the

116
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,040
actual meaning of the word

117
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,959
reconnaissance which is something that i

118
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,680
really want to talk about so

119
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,600
um the actual meaning of the word

120
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,959
reconnaissance

121
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,320
is derived from the military so it's all

122
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,919
about observation

123
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,919
and scoping out an area so in this case

124
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,080
as red teamers you want to perform

125
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,639
reconnaissance on a target

126
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,360
where you're essentially trying to

127
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,880
figure out you know the ins and outs of

128
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,639
your target you know what's open what's

129
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,360
closed

130
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,120
what are your entry points what are your

131
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,040
um you know what are parts that you

132
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,280
should shouldn't be going to

133
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,040
so that is kind of that kind of sums up

134
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,720
what reconnaissance is

135
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,320
and now i want to talk about some of the

136
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,080
key tools that i've got listed

137
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,240
so talking from personal experience and

138
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,800
map has to be with the number one tool

139
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,240
when it comes to recon

140
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,840
as a few reasons i'm calling it the

141
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,840
number one tool it's

142
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,080
because it's packed with additional

143
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,120
scripts

144
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,759
it's got a additional component attached

145
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,759
to it known as the nse

146
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,080
and the nmap scripting engine which i'll

147
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,080
be getting into in my demo

148
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,000
and with nmap you can get as much

149
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,240
information on your targets possible

150
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,280
which then helps you to basically uh get

151
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,479
exploitation

152
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,320
steps done the next tool is net cut

153
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,759
so net card's generally more useful when

154
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,639
it comes to

155
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,479
having your exploit ready you know

156
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,080
you've sent an exploit you then want to

157
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,440
catch a connection

158
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,720
so such a scenario would be basically

159
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,080
that would be classed as getting a

160
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,840
reverse shell

161
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,120
but net card can also be used in things

162
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,759
like port scanning

163
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,400
similar to nmap it is done for for it

164
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,840
can't be used for scanning but the good

165
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,840
thing about end cut or net cut as we

166
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,639
call it

167
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,840
is that it generates far um less

168
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,479
traffic now the other two tools which

169
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,080
i'm going to mention here nicktoon

170
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,360
goalbuster

171
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,720
they're more directed to a web

172
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,039
penetration testing scenario

173
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,960
so from previous experiences which i've

174
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,880
had with kind of red team and stuff

175
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,120
you know by engaging in labs and stuff

176
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,000
like that

177
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,120
i could confidently say that most vms

178
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,240
or ctfs or any kind of you know hack the

179
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,080
box machines you may come across

180
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,680
there's always going to be an element of

181
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,120
a web server

182
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,400
so it's always important to know how to

183
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,160
tackle the web server

184
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,080
so that's why i've included two really

185
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,080
good tools so that you've got nicto

186
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,199
where you can nicto is basically a tool

187
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,639
which is written in perl

188
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,080
and niktor has the ability to basically

189
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,360
identify vulnerabilities and

190
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,000
gain information on a website so it'll

191
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,199
you know

192
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,080
basically scan a web server and then

193
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,520
tell you the vulnerabilities

194
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,759
and then you've got go buster go buster

195
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,520
brute forces a website

196
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,000
gives you all the file parts and that's

197
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,039
usually useful

198
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,120
when there's maybe there's hidden file

199
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,639
parts there's hidden files

200
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,560
or there's even hidden domains if we're

201
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,960
talking about maybe virtual hosts on the

202
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,800
server

203
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,000
so now moving on to um

204
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,800
the next part which is now you've got to

205
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,400
make a choice here

206
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,039
now based on your rules of engagement

207
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:25,919
and even

208
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,080
your personal preference what do you do

209
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,599
do you go fully aggressive

210
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,160
or do you stay under the radar now it's

211
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,680
a choice that you need to make

212
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,360
but each choice will have its own

213
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,080
results so being aggressive

214
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,919
which is quite literally full frontal

215
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,280
assault you know going through the front

216
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,000
door

217
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,520
you will have um a lot of information

218
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,400
as a result and you know the more

219
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,599
information you get from your

220
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,120
reconnaissance

221
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,759
the more the better chance you've got of

222
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,560
getting

223
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,319
of accurately exploiting your target

224
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,800
now the downside of something like that

225
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,840
is that it

226
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,160
generates a lot of traffic so if you've

227
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,680
got network defenses

228
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,520
so let's put this in an example let's

229
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,319
say we've got an ssh server

230
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,280
now an ssh server may have some defenses

231
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,039
like filter ban

232
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,599
and if you're trying to send too many

233
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,440
requests to the ssh server you've

234
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,879
you've got yourself blocked you've

235
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,199
blocked yourself from a network defense

236
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,560
whilst trying to you know possibly recon

237
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,319
a service or exploit service

238
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,160
you've got yourself blocked and you've

239
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,919
made yourself known

240
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,640
on the other hand you could go for

241
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,559
stealth recon

242
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,839
now stealth recon would be less

243
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,519
information gained initially

244
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,240
but it would mean more steps you could

245
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,680
still achieve the same thing that you

246
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,279
would with aggressive recon

247
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,480
you just need to take more steps and

248
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,279
i believe with stealth recon it's more

249
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,320
directed towards

250
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,040
hardened systems so if there's firewalls

251
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,360
if there's an intrusion detection system

252
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,040
you want to apply stealth recon you

253
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,279
don't want to make yourself known

254
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,080
and just one more disadvantage about

255
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,720
aggressive recon before i move on

256
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,959
aggressive reconnaissance does have that

257
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,320
element of

258
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,519
causing a denial of service now you as

259
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:15,920
an

260
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,320
infosec professional you need to take

261
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,839
into consideration

262
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,120
what you do could cause damage to your

263
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,920
target

264
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,440
now if it's not in the rules of

265
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,040
engagement then

266
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,279
you know then that's not exactly the

267
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,800
best idea

268
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,000
so let's say you've got as i said

269
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,440
earlier let's see you've got an ssh

270
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,440
server let's say that's on production

271
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,000
you knock out that ssh server you've

272
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,440
then caused the denial of service for

273
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,720
your client

274
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,360
so being aggressive yes it's good it

275
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,399
creates a lot of

276
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,200
um generates a lot of output for you but

277
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,000
if you don't do it

278
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,040
carefully then you're causing yourself

279
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,160
more trouble than you're causing

280
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,120
yourself more benefits

281
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,440
so as i said at the beginning i'm going

282
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,800
to be

283
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,800
talking a little bit about about you

284
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,160
know what i'm gonna

285
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,440
about some of the tools some of the

286
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,920
approaches and kind of some of the

287
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,959
things and

288
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,399
now what i'm gonna do is i've got a

289
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,720
pre-recorded demonstration

290
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,959
so just to give you an overview i'm

291
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,079
going to be looking at

292
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,120
aggressive tactics so you know

293
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,560
how does a machine

294
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,800
oh sorry how does a attacker

295
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,839
aggressively

296
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,720
scan a machine how did this stealthy

297
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,480
scanner machine

298
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,519
and on the other hand

299
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,440
looking at some more tools so search

300
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,360
flight which i'll be explaining in my

301
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,279
demo but just you know

302
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,519
just to give you some oversight now it's

303
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,800
just an offline

304
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,480
vulnerability database where you can

305
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,880
confirm if a target's vulnerable

306
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,120
or as for certain version looking at

307
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,200
some manual reconnaissance that's always

308
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,880
important whenever you're

309
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,360
um looking at hardened targets hardened

310
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,040
targets are not the types

311
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,880
to just broadcast information you really

312
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,560
need to you know get in

313
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,959
deep into the target and really look um

314
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,160
hard

315
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,440
and looking at netcat you know how to

316
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,279
how does a scan of net card compared to

317
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,800
nmop and

318
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,519
f tcp dump looking up you know how you

319
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,000
would

320
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,720
look at such traffic so let's move on to

321
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,200
the video

322
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,360
first of all introducing the use of

323
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,279
aggressive admob scanning

324
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,120
so nmrp is a great tool in both ways

325
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,760
it can't be used very aggressively or it

326
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,839
can be used in the stealthiest ways

327
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,519
possible

328
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,760
now first of all i'm going to show this

329
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,680
aggressive use of nmap

330
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,800
and how you can benefit from an

331
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,839
aggressive scan

332
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,279
and how much information you can get

333
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,959
from it so first of all

334
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,720
i'm going to put the switches in and

335
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,880
then i'll explain each one

336
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,800
one by one so that you can gain a better

337
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,959
understanding of what you're looking at

338
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,839
and you can also use these kind of

339
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,600
methods and techniques in your

340
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,760
own pen tests so

341
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,639
starting off nmap minus sc which is a

342
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,000
default scripts

343
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,360
so admob is armed with a

344
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,320
scripting engine known as nse also

345
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,959
called the nmap scripting engine

346
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,680
now the nmap scripting engine is also is

347
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,399
almost a

348
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,639
it's an additional component which makes

349
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,480
nmap much stronger

350
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,320
and kind of gives it a lot more

351
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,600
capabilities

352
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,360
so that means your reconnaissance would

353
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,959
be a lot better

354
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,639
sv version detection so when nmr

355
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,760
attaches to a port it's able to detect

356
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,440
versions because you're given it that

357
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,079
option minus st

358
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,920
you're doing a full tcp connection

359
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,600
you're not trying anything sneaky you

360
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,600
don't really care about any of that

361
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,639
um minus n which

362
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,240
is no dns so

363
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,079
we are connecting to an ip address and

364
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,320
we're not connecting to a horse named

365
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,120
minus t5 which is the highest possible

366
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,560
timing

367
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,160
um you could make use with an n-map scan

368
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,920
minus vv uh the voice switches can

369
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,079
i think go up to at least five so

370
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,120
from from the from personal experience

371
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,959
using too many verbose switches can't be

372
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,639
a bad idea because then

373
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,240
you're almost getting redundant

374
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,839
information that you just don't really

375
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,600
care about

376
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,760
mine minus vv is good enough to kind of

377
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,760
give you a live update of what ports are

378
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,800
open

379
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,920
minus p minus so the first port on the

380
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,360
box support one

381
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,560
to port six five five three five

382
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,360
that's the maximum port on the tcp stock

383
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,680
on any machine

384
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,399
and of course the ip address of my

385
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,279
target

386
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,160
so i'll run this and as you can see

387
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,360
there's a lot of

388
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,800
there's a lot of information there a lot

389
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,399
of open ports

390
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,760
um so if we just quickly decipher the

391
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,880
output 151 scripts for scanning

392
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,000
um of course it's telling us what the

393
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,040
nmap scripting engine is doing

394
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,160
and it's given us the open ports now

395
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,760
when it comes to an aggressive scan um

396
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,839
i've i've just had a tcp dub running

397
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,560
there now tcp dump is just an equivalent

398
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,639
of wire shock

399
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,959
it's a terminal version where you can

400
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,040
kind of use tcp dub

401
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,880
to live can live track you know track

402
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,240
you know track traffic live when it's um

403
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,800
being sent across the wire so just

404
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,000
quickly explain the switches

405
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,360
again minus v v is the boss minus x x

406
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,959
is basically how the information is

407
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,480
displayed here

408
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,199
minus i is the interface so i'm using

409
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,880
each zero for mine

410
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,519
and the host filler now think of this

411
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,720
traffic think of this

412
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,760
um in terms of stealth factors

413
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,920
now let's say you've got a network

414
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,680
administrator on the other side or let's

415
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,079
say you've got port scanning defenses

416
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,519
now for those of you who've done a bit

417
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,040
of pen testing before who have come

418
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,079
across

419
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,040
things like um port scan port scan

420
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,160
detection

421
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,079
you'll see that as soon as you send too

422
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,279
many packets

423
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,360
the port will shut down and your end map

424
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,160
scan is basically worthless

425
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,199
now the reason there's so many packets

426
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,160
being sent right now

427
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,440
is because well

428
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,120
there's been so many packets been sent

429
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,480
because you've got

430
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,240
so much nmrp is sending so many packets

431
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,360
because there's so much version

432
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,720
detection

433
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,279
there's a lot of work going on in the

434
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,040
background of venmo

435
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,000
which means there has to be a lot of

436
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,240
traffic sense so you can already see

437
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,279
imap s is one of the open ports is

438
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,920
getting a lot of packets thrown at it

439
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,199
because there's so much um there's so

440
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:04,639
much information that

441
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,160
end map is sending to it and it's

442
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,560
getting back at the same time

443
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,839
now that's live tracking

444
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,519
the uh information going over the wire

445
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,759
now these scans can go on for a long

446
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:18,880
time which is why

447
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,000
i've already done the scan and

448
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,560
what i'll do is i'll quickly decipher

449
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,800
the

450
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,279
i'll quickly decipher the output file

451
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,199
and move on to the stealth side

452
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,320
so in terms of open ports we've got

453
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,800
53 open for dns we've got a few email

454
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,440
servers

455
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,399
we've got samba share and we've got um

456
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,399
an http server running

457
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,800
which also as you can see there's been a

458
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,560
bit of brute forcing going on here

459
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,040
because it's found some directories

460
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,240
now this information is very good for us

461
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,199
because

462
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,519
now we know exactly what services are

463
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:56,480
open

464
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,120
we know which services to target and

465
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,880
we've also got version numbers that we

466
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,279
can kind of use

467
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,720
in terms of searching for exploits so

468
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,400
this it would be too soon it could it

469
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,839
might be too soon at this stage to

470
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,199
search for exploits

471
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,799
but of course if you find specific

472
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,640
version numbers there's a really good

473
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,280
tool called

474
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,799
search flight which can help you to find

475
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,160
specific um versions and public

476
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,880
available exploits so

477
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,000
four point three point eleven now

478
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,240
i can run search flight search floyd is

479
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,679
an offline database

480
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,840
which is available on every kali linux

481
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,720
machine

482
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,600
well every kali links machine i've used

483
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,120
um in case you use one that's not

484
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,559
available then you'll come back and say

485
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,039
no

486
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,240
it wasn't available so um from the

487
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,720
machines that i've used it's available

488
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,039
but

489
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,600
if it's not available just do apt

490
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,240
install

491
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,520
exploit db of course if you're not root

492
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,120
and by the way never run a linux box um

493
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,320
use a root bad idea just me being me

494
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,039
um of course if you're not root pseudo

495
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,000
is what applies and exploit db should

496
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,200
get you sword

497
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,320
anyway search ploy

498
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,200
now put the exact number in of the

499
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,799
exploit now gonna bash

500
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,919
right okay it's about to do samba

501
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,840
again there we go so we've got an

502
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,120
exploit of

503
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,400
is known pipe and again if i wanted to

504
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,000
go to that exploit if i wanted to read

505
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,360
it if i wanted to pull it all i need to

506
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,000
go use that share exploit db

507
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,799
and linux

508
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,600
sorry one second exploits

509
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,120
it's been a while since i used exploit

510
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,720
db

511
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,480
remote for tool yet

512
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,360
so this is a mass flight script now

513
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,200
whether it applies to this machine or

514
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,000
not

515
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,360
you'd have to read the exploit you'd

516
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,640
have to understand it then you'd have to

517
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,760
fire it off but

518
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,240
my point being if you're ever coming

519
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,280
across

520
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,679
um if you're ever coming across version

521
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:02,480
numbers

522
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,640
search floyd's a really good resource to

523
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,760
turn to

524
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,120
now moving on to the stealth aspects of

525
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,240
um

526
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,039
and map and like i said is really good

527
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,320
when it comes to using stealth

528
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,360
techniques

529
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,760
so you can use nmap in such a way where

530
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,400
you're basically

531
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,960
being a little more sneakier with map on

532
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,600
your base

533
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,880
you're not going through you're not

534
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,000
going through the front door guns

535
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,120
blazing

536
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,760
you're employing some techniques which

537
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,640
could

538
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,600
um bypass network defenses but you know

539
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,280
there's no guarantees

540
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,039
some of these techniques will get caught

541
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,960
by modern day defenses

542
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,960
but not every defense will catch this

543
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,320
so nmap ss which is a sense gun

544
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,640
so send scan is what we call a half open

545
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,600
connection

546
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,919
when a tcp connection happens what

547
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,840
happens is a three-way handshake

548
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,919
you send a connection you receive a

549
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:56,880
connection back

550
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,039
the connection is enclosed what you do

551
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,960
with a sin scan you send a connection

552
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,559
you get a response

553
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,120
but with the way the pocket is crafted

554
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,720
it's designed in such a way that the

555
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,320
connection never closes therefore it's

556
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,480
not locked

557
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,559
it's considered stealthy but modern day

558
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,320
ids is like snort

559
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,799
intrusion detection systems can't catch

560
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,080
it but again

561
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,600
don't get disheartened by that because

562
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,640
not everyone's using this note

563
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,159
minus t2 um

564
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,200
that's slow timing so

565
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,799
again you know you don't want to fire

566
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,320
too many packets at once like you saw

567
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,480
those so many packets being sent before

568
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,000
you want to be a bit slower you want to

569
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,760
be you want to hide in plain sight

570
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,280
minus minus mtu now what this is is

571
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,120
maximum transmission unit and what we

572
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,360
call this is packet fragmentation

573
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,440
pocket fragmentation is when we minimize

574
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,120
the size packets

575
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,919
and we send smaller packets so that they

576
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,000
could pass under the radar

577
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,080
minus vv again like you saw before the

578
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,120
boss

579
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,200
now a bit more of a targeted scan so

580
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,320
we're not

581
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,880
basically ripping the stack apart the

582
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,600
tcp stack apart terms of ports

583
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,120
we're going for specific ports

584
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,559
now run that and quickly go back on tcp

585
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,240
dom you can already see

586
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,200
that the packets being fired or not it's

587
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,280
not going berserk this time

588
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,640
there's you know very there's a steady

589
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,039
pace of packets and ports that are being

590
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,400
um probed now

591
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,000
already you got a result back so you

592
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,080
know there's less information there

593
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,919
but at the same time you've left a much

594
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,600
smaller footprint

595
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,440
so like what as you already saw the

596
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,720
packets were

597
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,000
not going as fast it's definitely not 31

598
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,320
000 that's the previous capture included

599
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,760
um so you've already so you now saw

600
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,760
so you've now saw the stealth users of

601
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,320
nmop the aggressive users of map

602
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,799
now one thing i want to stress is and

603
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,320
map can be

604
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,039
a tool it nmap is such a good tool that

605
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,720
you can rely too much on it

606
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,080
now what you don't want to do is rely

607
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,000
too much on nmr put yourself in a

608
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,679
situation where nmap isn't available

609
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,280
what do you do then

610
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,720
you're either in big trouble because

611
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,400
you'd rely too much on it

612
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,400
or you're absolutely fine because you

613
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,080
don't rely too much on the map

614
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,840
and you've got other ways around it now

615
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,919
if you don't have other ways around

616
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,919
just use an n-map well you will by the

617
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,440
end of this demo

618
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,520
so one of the tools which i like to um

619
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,760
use to be a bit more stealthier and to

620
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,200
produce less traffic

621
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,240
than nmap itself is a tool called netcut

622
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,799
now netcat is just generally known for

623
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:39,280
being

624
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,799
a um network administration tool

625
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,280
but you can't use it for kind of port

626
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,120
scans and stuff like that

627
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,679
so i'm going to repeat or recreate this

628
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,360
nmop scan

629
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,880
and what i'm going to do is i'm going

630
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,480
gonna run it through net card so i'm

631
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:54,799
gonna

632
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,760
use some um

633
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,760
i'm gonna use the kind of bar shell

634
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,480
to do some net card scripts

635
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,720
no not well it's almost like a like a

636
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,200
full loop to use them

637
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,280
net cards so just quickly explaining

638
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,559
what i'm doing

639
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,679
um what i'm doing is i'm doing nvbz

640
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,799
which is a port scan so no dns fully

641
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:21,760
verbose

642
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,919
you want zero i o mode which is a port

643
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:24,960
scan

644
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,000
um you want a timeout three seconds each

645
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,159
time

646
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,960
you want the ip address of your target

647
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,880
you want dollar i

648
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,200
and again to be a little bit tired but

649
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,120
stealth here you probably want to have a

650
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,000
five second

651
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,720
sleep switch go done

652
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,559
now let's uh kind of wait for that one

653
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,799
let's kind of watch that happen on the

654
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,960
tcp dump capture

655
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,720
so you can already see packets are being

656
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,679
sent one by one by one by one

657
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,760
five seconds another five another five

658
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,960
and another five

659
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,360
and you can already see ports open so

660
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,720
less noise slower less pockets being

661
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,240
generated but you're still

662
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,720
getting some information now

663
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,840
you don't have nmap to give you

664
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,400
information

665
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,360
but at the same time there are tools

666
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,120
which you can use to manually connect to

667
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,320
these services

668
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,919
so i'm going to quickly run an example

669
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,960
then so 8080 is open

670
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,880
now a common tool that you can use is

671
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,440
wget to connect to any web server out

672
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,400
there

673
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,720
now what i'm going to do is i'm going to

674
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,320
use wget

675
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,200
or i can use curl which whichever based

676
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,320
on preference

677
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,919
what i'm going to do is i'm going to use

678
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,000
w get minus q

679
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,400
to kind of really quiet in the output

680
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,440
and minus s

681
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,080
to extract the headers so what i'm going

682
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,360
to do now

683
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,240
is i've got the port number what i'm

684
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,679
going to do now

685
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,279
is as you can see and map in the nmap

686
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,000
scan

687
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,240
the aggressive nmap scan somewhere here

688
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,159
it told me it's running apache

689
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:10,080
1.1 yeah now just using wget

690
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,559
i can get the same information just by

691
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,360
sending a normal http request

692
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,559
and not using nmap and

693
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,000
risking being caught by nmr i can go a

694
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,760
step further so now i know

695
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,039
apa is running apache coyote 1.1 i can

696
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,080
then

697
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,320
no i didn't do that i can then use curl

698
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,720
what i can then do is i can basically um

699
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,600
read the the webpage using curl or i can

700
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,440
manually go to the web page using curls

701
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,000
so

702
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,640
i know it's now using it it's using

703
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,600
tomcat 7.

704
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,360
now from this point i can also use other

705
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,320
tools

706
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,679
such as smb client so i know

707
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,640
that the um

708
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,960
i know that the

709
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,720
server is running a samba share so i can

710
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,559
just directly connect to it

711
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,600
and start probing it manually

712
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,840
now all this probing is being done

713
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,960
manually

714
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,360
you're producing less traffic and you're

715
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,400
not relying

716
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,440
on just a tool to do your reconnaissance

717
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,360
so there are workarounds and i hope you

718
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,559
learned something from this

719
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:28,240
demonstration thank you very much

720
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,480
first of all so i hope that talk was uh

721
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,159
i hope the demo was definitely helpful

722
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,000
and informative to you all

723
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,440
and um now let's talk about some

724
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,360
things which i feel are important

725
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,880
definitely if you're progressing in red

726
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,919
teaming

727
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,720
um the first thing i want to emphasize

728
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,440
definitely emphasize so much so much is

729
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,720
take your time when you're doing your

730
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,200
recon doing your recon

731
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,240
is is think of it like an 80 20 rule

732
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,400
80 reconnaissance 20 um

733
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,840
20 percent uh 20

734
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,039
of exploitation and now

735
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,520
from that point you then want to think

736
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,520
about

737
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,120
try to learn a scripting language from

738
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,600
that point so

739
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,520
python bash you know if you're doing n

740
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,279
map scans all the time if you're doing

741
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,240
niktor scans

742
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,240
all the time if you're doing these kind

743
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,480
of things all the time

744
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,399
you're eventually you're just going to

745
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:29,919
waste time doing them all the time so

746
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:30,960
automate that

747
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,000
move on to manual recon the third

748
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,520
part is use a proxy server so

749
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,679
this is more for web apps but it's still

750
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,760
applicable to any kind of

751
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,720
ten testing you do so use a proxy server

752
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,559
to intercept requests

753
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,880
use a proxy server to modify them and

754
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,320
essentially you can keep a track of

755
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,640
everything from that point

756
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,000
um just a quick trick

757
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,919
if you ever wondered how to identify an

758
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:59,919
os without doing too much active

759
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,000
reconnaissance and active probing

760
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,080
ping the machine and once you ping the

761
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,320
machine you'll see a ttl value

762
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,480
the ttl value should be

763
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,559
6401 to it and

764
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:15,120
of course if you're want to learn

765
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,320
further

766
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,360
ensure that you are um looking at things

767
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,200
like hping3

768
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,320
and uh scopy those two

769
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:29,120
are certainly good things to

770
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,120
use so that's about it from them

771
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,399
from me i really do hope i um

772
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,480
give you some food for thought and

773
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,320
definitely you know

774
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,200
give you some uh things that you can

775
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,640
learn and

776
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,200
and all the rest and uh thank you very

777
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,159
much do take care

778
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,720
thank you okay brilliant nice detail
