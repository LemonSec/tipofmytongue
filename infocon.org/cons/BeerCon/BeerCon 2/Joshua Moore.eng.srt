15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,400
everyone

16
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,760
this is a co-vacation or

17
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,079
a what fancy new word of how i would

18
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,719
call it so

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,920
here we are my recent late faculty

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,559
graduate first class of coronavirus

21
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:45,680
pandemic

22
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,039
recently landed my first blue team role

23
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,000
ethical hacking society of leeds backup

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,719
member

25
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,840
conference goer in normal times were

26
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,600
on virtual beer drinker and a runner

27
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,159
so 2020 in a slide

28
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,280
we've had a lockdown and we've had

29
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,240
donald trump

30
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,280
put us all out of jobs because

31
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,880
we only need 15 of a password

32
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,640
it has been a strange one all year round

33
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,680
and we're back in lockdown again to make

34
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,840
matters more interesting

35
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,840
so let's talk about

36
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,479
education more precisely universities

37
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,640
why universities because

38
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,680
being a recent graduate i

39
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,720
have recently found that us as an

40
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,759
industry and fulsac have

41
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,759
been helping people students succeed

42
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,240
and we probably haven't realized that

43
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,799
we've been doing it

44
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,960
even though we've been doing all these

45
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,000
things for the current time

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,399
another point why we need to talk about

47
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,360
this

48
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,840
this group of students coming through in

49
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,960
this pandemic

50
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,919
will have likely a new set of skills

51
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,080
which few got from the experience

52
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,560
before

53
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,959
so my experience this was lovely

54
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,080
leads back at campus during a sunny day

55
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,680
which was rare first year of uni was

56
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,879
an introduction to infosec um

57
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,040
my first real experience of hearing

58
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,000
about it

59
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,760
with a lot of beer second year of uni

60
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,400
hobbes

61
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,599
the same amount of beer a lot more work

62
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,519
on some late nights in this big building

63
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,000
third year i was i don't placement as an

64
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,120
it intern

65
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,000
100 worth it i'll cover more about that

66
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,040
later

67
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,599
and fourth year was when things got

68
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,519
challenging

69
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,959
eighty percent of the time was on campus

70
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,959
in a normal year and then

71
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,200
covet hit we moved to work from home

72
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,480
and it got interesting

73
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,319
for the class of 2020

74
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,680
why because it was unknown

75
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,840
we haven't done this in so long

76
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,280
since the last pandemic which was

77
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,480
way before the last world war so i don't

78
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,680
think we've ever really had to

79
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,640
experience this

80
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,680
in my opinion

81
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,879
so uni year one a message

82
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,599
to freshers what a time to be a

83
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,440
fresher

84
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,959
you're all online you can't go out

85
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,440
you can't drink beer especially at the

86
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,480
minute you've lost all the socializing

87
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,920
university has changed a lot but

88
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,720
it's inevitable that with the

89
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,640
coronavirus pandemic

90
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,840
the things was accelerated to change

91
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,480
however on a positive the amount of beer

92
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,080
that they're probably saving from not

93
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,599
going out

94
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,840
money-wise means they're not going to be

95
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,959
as skint as

96
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,080
previous ones coming through

97
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,079
so if i were a fresher now i would go

98
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,720
do i want to be here should i be doing

99
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,279
this

100
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,639
working from home in a environment

101
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,680
in which you're paying

102
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,800
uk fees of most likely

103
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,080
nine thousand pound over the year

104
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,040
for an experience in which you can get

105
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,560
on open university

106
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,320
for a lot cheaper and there's a

107
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,720
discussion to be had around that

108
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,840
around fees but i'll not leave it for

109
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,040
this talk because

110
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,479
it's a storm waiting to happen

111
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,000
so you're in second year of uni

112
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,680
during this pandemic keep buggering on

113
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,960
is the message which is most likely

114
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,800
to happen and the best one to be said

115
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,039
it's getting more real it counts a lot

116
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,840
more towards your

117
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,680
degree if you're in second year of

118
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,479
uni and you have a sandwich your course

119
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,919
coming up

120
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,919
don't panic about looking for a

121
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,759
placement

122
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,400
or either if you don't go on a placement

123
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,720
you're looking into

124
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,680
moving to your final year of you of

125
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,680
university

126
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,639
second year of uni is also when you

127
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,440
start to

128
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,639
specialize a lot more within

129
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,759
your degree this is where

130
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,680
i realized that as a

131
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,639
job red teaming is something that

132
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,600
interested me

133
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,199
however life had a different plan

134
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,639
corona virus it changed what i wanted to

135
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:54,960
do

136
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,039
on how i wanted to do it but

137
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,400
that change happens and there isn't too

138
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,759
much in which

139
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,800
you can do about it which is why kbo

140
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,800
is the perfect message to be telling

141
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,280
everyone

142
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,720
so this is quite an important slide to

143
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,360
me

144
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,800
in the fact that uni year three

145
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,000
i did a placement year i've had

146
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,160
people ask me from that i know

147
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,800
should i be doing a placement the answer

148
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,360
is

149
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,400
yes will placements be available

150
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,840
during the current climate the answer is

151
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,479
yes they are available at the time of

152
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:39,120
writing

153
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,919
i went on to graham cracker and there

154
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,000
was

155
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,600
336 placements

156
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,720
last internships available the almost

157
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,080
truth

158
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,639
placements are cheap labor for some

159
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:53,440
companies

160
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,400
to get they get the job done because

161
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,240
they're paying intern rates

162
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,280
whether that is how some employers

163
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,400
would see it but it's the best way of

164
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:04,880
getting

165
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,919
more experience within your cv

166
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,960
so placements when i did mine

167
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,199
i was in the office these days it's

168
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,240
going to be

169
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,599
a lot more different when

170
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,720
you look at how it's going on

171
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,720
but this is where a new set of skills

172
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,479
in which a lot of people do not have

173
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,800
will be coming through working from home

174
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,440
it is a challenge it won't be for the

175
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,400
longer term

176
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,880
it will be a short term but if you're

177
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,440
already

178
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,479
in uni on surviving and smashing it with

179
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:45,759
the short term

180
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,400
then that is the skill in which a lot of

181
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,440
people

182
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,919
didn't have you'll be able to integrate

183
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:52,639
easier

184
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,520
with some of the teams in which you're

185
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,960
looking at

186
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,080
another note on placements

187
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,599
my placement was as a system

188
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,360
administrator

189
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,240
again it wasn't what i thought i would

190
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,039
be doing

191
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,319
was i glad i did it yes

192
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,360
did it give me a lot more experience yes

193
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,240
did it give me a lot more hands-on

194
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,280
experience

195
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,039
as well it also gave me basic

196
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,520
knowledge in which i did not think i

197
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,639
needed

198
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,919
but i'm glad i've got it so

199
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,080
the placements are out there if you're

200
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,360
looking for a placement

201
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,719
keep going because they can be there

202
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,240
and you will get them

203
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,679
so final year is the dissertation

204
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,600
for a lot of people and graduation

205
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,120
or for me on the class of 2020

206
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,120
we're still waiting for one which is

207
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,040
an interesting time to see when it'll

208
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,279
happen if it'll happen

209
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,440
so my dissertation it was

210
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,279
on a lovely iot device seen in the photo

211
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,760
a yi home camera was i glad in which

212
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,880
i did this yes again was it not what i

213
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,600
wanted

214
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,800
to be doing or what i thought i would

215
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,000
end up doing

216
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,360
yes things change as a plan and through

217
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:23,680
this

218
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,800
changing you adapt you cheat

219
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,800
you get new skills through doing this

220
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,160
so if you have an idea stick with it

221
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,560
but if you can adapt and change

222
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,399
especially within the circumstances in

223
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,080
which you're doing it

224
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,279
because during coronavirus

225
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,440
on this pandemic you're going to have to

226
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,839
i also think we should be encouraging

227
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,000
more people to do more side projects

228
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,560
within

229
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,519
university not to the same extent as

230
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,120
which a dissertation is

231
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,839
because of the amount of work that goes

232
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:00,480
into it

233
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,880
this is a whole year's work however

234
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,519
there is a lot to be said about the

235
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,320
experience

236
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,760
of taking on the whole practical side of

237
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,040
a dissertation

238
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,360
this is done by the students

239
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,320
or by myself for example and you gain a

240
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,600
lot more skills

241
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,240
in which you're doing it so side

242
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,600
projects like this

243
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,959
which make a very good point of saying

244
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,519
these could be picked up more in my

245
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,839
opinion

246
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,480
everyone's favorite one-liner we all

247
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,240
said it at one stage during

248
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,680
uni i'm going to drop out some people

249
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,279
say it more than others

250
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,800
however my advice if you really want to

251
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,680
do it

252
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,839
do it getting into industry through this

253
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,399
way is not the only way

254
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,399
in which it can be done and it's

255
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,079
important to point that out

256
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,880
there is a lot to be said about sticking

257
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,680
with it

258
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,560
especially because we know that we're

259
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,600
going to be living with

260
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,959
coronavirus during this time and in how

261
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,640
we make it better

262
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,600
and unis will change and units will

263
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,320
adapt

264
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,959
in different circumstances it may not

265
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:15,600
always

266
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,320
be this bad so if you're going to drop

267
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:18,720
out

268
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,680
make sure you really want to do it and

269
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,040
if you do it

270
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,480
then you'll get into your favorite job

271
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,959
or how wherever you want to end up a

272
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,079
different way

273
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,320
there is multiple ways to end up doing

274
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,560
this

275
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,640
so then we come to my experience

276
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,480
after july when i finished university

277
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,680
job hunting during a pandemic it changed

278
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,720
a lot i started job hunting at the start

279
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,200
of final year through the normal ways

280
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,040
linkedin was something i set up

281
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,920
but i didn't expect to be using it

282
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,639
however

283
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,880
building up this digital platform in

284
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,160
this current time

285
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,680
became so important to me finding myself

286
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,959
on locating my first job twitter

287
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,600
is something nothing new we've been

288
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,519
doing this as an industry for years

289
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,440
we all speak to each other we all know

290
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,000
this and we all help each other through

291
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,800
this

292
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,440
so getting on these two platforms and

293
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,959
getting to know the people

294
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,560
on the current topic within these is

295
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,519
interesting there will be days when you

296
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:31,920
go

297
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,040
why did i join this platform but again

298
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,560
if you stick with it

299
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,680
like like anything the benefits will

300
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,279
rape

301
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,920
so when i mentioned earlier about saying

302
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,920
that

303
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,639
the skills in which some of the current

304
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,120
students having these

305
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,560
which myself and some others do not have

306
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,760
working from home uni is work from home

307
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,560
at the minute

308
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,200
this is something in which students

309
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,519
whether you're an undergrad a postgrad

310
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,600
a master's student you're going to have

311
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,120
to learn to deal with

312
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,160
and if you're in final year then

313
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,720
you're more than likely going to have to

314
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,480
join the team in a work from home

315
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,040
environment the good news is if you've

316
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,160
been doing it

317
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,320
through university you've got the

318
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,360
experience

319
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,839
in it it's not going to be that much of

320
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,360
a change

321
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,000
so on to the next slide

322
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,000
a current problem we face in industry

323
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,240
i can't get a job but i can't get

324
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,240
experience to get a job

325
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,240
something we have all thought about

326
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,079
we've all struggled with

327
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,639
but i'm going to offer a different

328
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,399
opinion on that

329
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,639
and then fusek new starter looking at an

330
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,560
emphasic rule

331
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,120
understanding a domain is an example of

332
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,160
a simple thing

333
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,920
in which university students

334
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,000
sometimes overlook something very simple

335
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,279
i'm not nailing down the job advert

336
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,399
before they apply

337
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,760
to freely understanding that

338
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,519
which again is a different perspective

339
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,720
but there is a side to this coin in

340
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,880
which you can flip and saying

341
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,880
you can teach someone to be good at a

342
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,279
job within this job

343
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,600
you can teach them how to use the

344
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,639
platforms

345
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,680
in which some circumstances unis may not

346
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,120
teach

347
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,240
which in my case was splunk i'd

348
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,639
i had very little experience with this

349
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,240
during

350
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,639
uni i have no experience with this i'm

351
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,320
going into the job now

352
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,160
i'm working in a job where i'm using

353
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,839
this day in day out

354
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,480
you will learn these things however

355
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,720
let's slowly move to the next slide

356
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,000
which is one that is interesting

357
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,040
this is a google scholar search of the

358
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,839
effects

359
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,920
of coronavirus on education

360
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,079
these effects will be

361
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,839
seen for a long time within

362
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,720
the academia whether it's through

363
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,560
ransomware attacks that are being felt

364
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:18,959
now

365
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,680
within industry which are being

366
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,440
disclosed within

367
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,680
the news however some unique horses

368
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,320
may feel these more than others if

369
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:30,720
you're

370
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,440
studying cyber security though i would

371
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,199
bet

372
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,800
on the fact that a lot of it is online

373
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,040
on that you're in a better place to deal

374
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,920
with this

375
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,599
than some other courses

376
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,399
the last thing to say on this is

377
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,639
this was a change in which the world was

378
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,399
forced into

379
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,680
no one predicted coronavirus to come up

380
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,680
to this stage of how where we are now

381
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,680
we've been living with it for nearly a

382
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,120
year

383
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,079
when i was finishing uni this got thrust

384
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:09,600
on to us within

385
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,800
days or weeks we walked in to uni

386
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,839
as a group one day and we got asked why

387
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:16,880
did you come into

388
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,440
uni there's a pandemic on and we were

389
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,720
like we weren't given

390
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,000
any more information as to not come in

391
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,800
whereas now unis have had the summer to

392
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,600
adapt

393
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,560
they're in a better position to do this

394
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,440
and to teach

395
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,920
online

396
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,160
another important slide to mention is

397
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,360
common questions

398
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,199
in which i get asked myself

399
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,560
how how to do a cv and make it good

400
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,320
questions you can ask during an

401
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,800
interview where to look for job rules

402
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,920
search slash qualifications um

403
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,639
i'm just going to start with the fact

404
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:57,519
that

405
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,800
certs do not make a good input member

406
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,279
there's plenty of people out there that

407
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,319
have

408
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,480
good jobs well respected within the

409
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,799
industry without certs

410
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,319
job rules i'm gonna move to next again

411
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,880
through linkedin through twitter they

412
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,520
can come about in any way possible

413
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,480
yes there's the sights of indeed where

414
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,760
they happen

415
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,119
and they get posted to even grab cracker

416
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:29,200
they have been used for day in day out

417
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,400
and again it's not really reinventing

418
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,280
the wheel here

419
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,039
it is coming through the same

420
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,000
information that has been

421
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,200
used there for ages it is using these

422
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,640
tools in a different way

423
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,520
to make the current students coming

424
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,200
through and the new year and fusac

425
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:47,919
members

426
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,760
succeed how to do a cv and make it good

427
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,679
and questions you can ask during an

428
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:54,960
interview

429
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,320
both depend on the interview on the job

430
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,160
in which you're going for

431
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,360
tailor it to which you're looking

432
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,840
get a job spec down to make sure that

433
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,880
you don't end up

434
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,760
in a situation mentioned before where

435
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,440
you go for an infosec rule

436
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,160
and you don't understand a basic concept

437
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,360
where it can happen

438
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,919
and it will happen a lot frequently if

439
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,840
it does happen

440
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,880
that's okay it happens you you move on

441
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:28,720
you learn you go research

442
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,320
so improve set hobbies on top of this

443
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,240
things that you should be really looking

444
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,840
to make sure that you don't fall into

445
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,120
the pit trap

446
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,720
of some of these i don't understand

447
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,080
key concepts things that we have said as

448
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,000
an industry to do

449
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,400
for many years now that are not

450
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,320
reinventing the rail

451
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,640
but when you look at blogs that are out

452
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,679
there in

453
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,960
a university concept because it's all

454
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,760
online

455
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,000
these will become so much more important

456
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,200
into how

457
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,360
our students that are coming through are

458
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,440
learning it is what helped me

459
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,559
in the last few months of uni

460
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,840
building the homeland lab getting used

461
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,520
to them windows linux mac os concepts

462
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,400
in which you can give yourself a better

463
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,080
platform to thrive

464
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,280
hack the box and try acme platforms in

465
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,559
which you can learn

466
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,840
a lot and again not reinventing the

467
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,640
whale

468
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,960
but making sure that people know about

469
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,760
these

470
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,400
have the skills that are being picked up

471
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,600
from their

472
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,880
blogs there's loads out there again

473
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,200
if you want to make your own that's okay

474
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,559
if someone's done

475
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,440
a topic that you want to blog about go

476
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,400
and do it

477
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,679
because it's just going to look better

478
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:50,240
on you

479
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,080
you can learn and you can develop from

480
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,240
what other people have done

481
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,960
follow the news of your niche look at

482
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,880
what you want to get into

483
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,000
for example my dissertation around iot

484
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
i spent months around this in trying to

485
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,200
follow the news

486
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,760
making sure that the death was racing

487
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,520
vulnerabilities were coming through that

488
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,158
were recent

489
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,679
something that we don't say to a lot

490
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,520
life outside of infosec you do not have

491
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,280
to live and brief and focus

492
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,640
24 7. yes there is people that do

493
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,440
and that's their way it is important to

494
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,280
make sure that you don't get burnt out

495
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,799
with these sort of stuff

496
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,400
go have a beer go follow a football team

497
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,000
like mike does go tweet avoid football

498
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,200
um you can there's

499
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,760
so much to be said about people that

500
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,640
have hobbies

501
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,440
outside of infosec hobbies these people

502
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,919
are coming along with soft skills

503
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,080
and these soft skills will only force

504
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,960
you into a better position

505
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,360
because these soft skills are on

506
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,799
communication

507
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,200
we need we need them we need to be able

508
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,840
to talk to other people

509
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,840
why we need to talk to other people that

510
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,039
don't understand this

511
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,520
is because as soon as we start blaming

512
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,880
and through

513
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,120
non-infect people for improve sex

514
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,200
problems is the minute we start to lose

515
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:17,760
the battle

516
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,840
with these people a little quote

517
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,960
which i think is fitting in this current

518
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,440
time

519
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,000
a man with new ideas is a madman until

520
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,159
his ideas triumphed

521
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,240
during the most challenging times we

522
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,760
often see some major

523
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,919
development whether we have seen this or

524
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,480
not in the current pandemic

525
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,919
this will be told but when the world is

526
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,280
faced with a crisis

527
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,400
we often see new new

528
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,600
ideas coming to fruition some of which

529
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,919
can change a lot on how we work

530
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,080
a final word of hope that any students

531
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,200
that are out there

532
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,679
look to the class of 2020 that have just

533
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:00,400
gone

534
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,280
why because we've graduated we got

535
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:03,840
thrust

536
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,880
upon this we lived it we got jobs it

537
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,240
can't be done

538
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,559
and we didn't crash and burn when the

539
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,280
unknown came to us

540
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,440

yeah absolutely brilliant josh yeah

553
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,919
superb and and we do kind of work

554
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:47,679
closely as best we can with people in

555
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:48,799
academic life

556
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,240
and you know we've done a lot of talks

557
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,600
the beer farms and a lot of talks over

558
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,120
the past two years around

559
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,559
the university circuits and all that

560
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,640
kind of thing and we're really

561
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,799
we really do want to encourage it and

562
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,720
and help her bring people along

563
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,000
and i think you talk there should

564
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,919
encourage a lot of people that are going

565
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,360
through perhaps the back end of their

566
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,880
academic life and then

567
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,520
taking those little steps into industry

568
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,320
um

569
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,799
so yeah you know really well done and i

570
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,159
think some of your points about it being

571
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,760
a collaboration and people got to work

572
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,320
together

573
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,600
marching on together right apologies for

574
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,679
the dark room it's got very dark over

575
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:22,000
here

576
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,320
and lockdown north northern ireland we

577
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,360
just thought that you were

578
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,880
practicing gradual opsec

579
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,960
getting used to this hacker guys yeah

580
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,159

582
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,760

583
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,159
about

584
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,200
it you deliver it really patiently um

585

very articulately so well done to you um

586
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,760
i don't think we have any direct

587
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,440
questions for you i think you probably

588
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,440
oh we do have a question and it's from

589
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,360
mr scott mcgrady in the room scott

590
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,240
yeah thanks a lot um josh i just have a

591
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,080
bit of a question about

592
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,559
what your thoughts are and not from a

593
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,240
kind of

594
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,600
what do you think is going to happen i'm

595
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,360
going to hold you to it it's more just

596
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,520
a general what do you think is going to

597
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,640
happen here

598
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,720
um education for me was a bit different

599
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,000
i got my education

600
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,799
paid for by the state so that helped

601
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:13,919
massively

602
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,919
do you think because there is a lot of

603
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,840
students and when you said you know this

604
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,440
is a time to be a student

605
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,600
um the twitch chat was just like yep yep

606
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,000
yep yep yep yeah plus one plus one

607
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,240
um so my question is do you think

608
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,840
universities are gonna

609
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,000
change maybe their their models in some

610
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,279
way and offer

611
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,480
a remote can of course as a

612
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,279
as a reduced fee or something or do

613
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,120
something a bit differently try and do

614
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,880
like a covered package basically

615
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,600
education

616
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,520
and the standard education once

617
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,200
everything returns to normality

618
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,320
do you think there's going to be

619
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,480
something like that there

620
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,919
is a lot to be said about this because

621
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,120
universities have tried in trying to

622
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:00,159
accommodate the old way and there is

623
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,480
the most likely scenario in which we end

624
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,480
up in face-to-face learning

625
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,520
back in the way that we were

626
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,039
before all this hit however

627
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,880
there there needs to be a change

628
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,480
in not so much our courses

629
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,600
but whether it's fees or how it's taught

630
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,880
and yes whether there should be a

631
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,720
coronavirus package

632
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,039
like forcing students back into student

633
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,240
accommodation

634
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,279
on government was not a good eye not a

635
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,559
good idea

636
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,760
but it was to try to get back to

637
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,039
some normality however if

638
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,279
we look at this night after christmas it

639
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,559
could change

640
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,559
we it's hard to know given the change in

641
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,240
circumstances

642
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,760
that happens so often

643
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,760
yeah it just sucks it sucks from my

644
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,880
point of view it's like

645
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,200
hearing about conferences that you know

646
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,960
cost money or training courses that cost

647
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,559
money but it's all delivered virtually

648
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,480
now and not in person but it still costs

649
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,520
the same amount

650
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,840
yeah um and you know people just

651
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,559
overlook

652
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:09,279
or the vast majority of people overlook

653
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,200
academia and don't realize it's 9 000

654
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,320
pounds a year

655
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,080
and you're forced to go in and you're

656
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,919
forced to go to student accommodation

657
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,080
even if it's all delivered virtually but

658
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,840
the bills are still waiting

659
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,919
um and that's that's a you know we're

660
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,760
we're moving to more online i think it

661
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,400
was

662
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,159
was it black cat moved to completely

663
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,679
free this year

664
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,679
i think it was yeah yeah black can't

665
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,120
move completely free if and

666
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,880
sans moved completely free that was the

667
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,279
one i was thinking of if they can do it

668
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,960
why can't other conferences and why

669
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,400
can't universities or at least

670
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,000
lower the fees and be a bit more

671
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
accommodating it's just more

672
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,520
i feel as if you know the education is

673
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,880
we should really be looking after

674
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,720
students not not trying to

675
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,520
dick them over as as human beings so

676
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,440
there is something that he said about

677
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,799
how we fall back

678
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,080
onto human communication

679
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,320
we like that face to face contact

680
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,400
because it makes us feel

681
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,120
a lot safer in what we know we're

682
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,719
talking about i'm being taught

683
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,840
yeah yeah i completely agree

684
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,880
i mean personally i i've i've

685
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,960
battling the bets and lack of

686
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,159
interaction and that and

687
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,320
at the end of the day we aren't designed

688
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,640
to communicate through a camera we

689
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,159
desire to communicate

690
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,600
via whatever um we normally do

691
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,600
um i actually had a question as well um

692
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,760
so with the whole virtual thing there is

693
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,600
a downside but as we've seen these

694
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,200
conferences especially like us

695
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,840
organizing conferences like this the

696
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,360
virtual aspect has

697
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,159
a benefits in terms of hey i don't have

698
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,480
to catch a flight and spend thousands of

699
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,039
pounds on traveling and accommodation do

700
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,159
you think that's going to

701
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,440
help in some aspects on the education

702
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,200
part like universities getting different

703
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,960
speakers in that

704
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,480
yeah i mean at calm because as a as i

705
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,399
said as an industry we've been

706
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:07,440
doing blog posts and reading up on each

707
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,559
other's work for

708
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:11,760
years and now it's a time in which

709
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,039
we actually have a need for these posts

710
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,200
to be looked at and pushed out the

711
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,000
students

712
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,399
and get them doing their own to increase

713
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:21,440
their learning

714
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,640
in which they may not be getting

715
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,840
as much of in university given the

716
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,320
circumstances

717
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,760
