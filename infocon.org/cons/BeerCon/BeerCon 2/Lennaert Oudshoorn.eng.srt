1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,040
all right welcome back

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,160
uh for a final talk of bureaucon 2. um

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,000
we're joined by lennox and he's going to

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,240
talk all about responsible hacking

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,679
and responsible disclosure take it away

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,359
thank you for the introduction sean uh

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,720
and i indeed will be talking about

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,240
ethics in ethical hacking and

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,800
responsible disclosure

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,560
and we'll start with an outline of what

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,720
i will be talking about today

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,800
starting with a short introduction then

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,199
i'll go on to why we're having this talk

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,000
and what ethics actually are followed by

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,920
the principles of ethics

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,719
four different types of ethical theories

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,879
and my personal considerations during

18
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,239
responsible disclosure about

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,399
ethics and followed by some practical

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,760
examples

21
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,160
to give an idea of what kind of choices

22
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,640
you can be making

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,399
starting with my introduction i'm

24
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,840
leonard

25
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,239
i do volunteer research for the dutch

26
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,640
institute of vulnerability disclosure

27
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,520
you can find me on twitter at the 989

28
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,000
and i sometimes blog over at the url you

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,879
see on screen

30
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,159
but very infrequently so we'll start

31
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:08,560
with

32
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,360
why we're having this talk and when i

33
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,080
pitched the

34
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,680
uh slides or the cfp for this

35
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,720
i spoke about it with uh scott mcgrady

36
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,880
cyber security expert and asked if it

37
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,560
would be interesting and they went on

38
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,320
i don't even know what two of these

39
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,680
words mean

40
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,880
so we take it that even though we use

41
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,720
the term ethical hacker

42
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,960
a lot in our industry we apparently

43
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,920
don't really know

44
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,799
that much about ethical theory or ethics

45
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,159
in general really

46
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,920
so we have quite a poor understanding of

47
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,759
it i would say so

48
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,680
that's why we're having this talk and

49
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,880
i'm hoping to

50
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,320
give you some tools to make the

51
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,479
decisions and to make the right

52
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,280
decisions when ethics are in play

53
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,200
and that brings us to what ethics

54
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,880
actually are

55
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,880
so there are moral principles that

56
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,119
govern a person's behavior

57
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,159
or the conducting of an activity that's

58
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,759
according to the oxford languages

59
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,479
then merriam-webster says the discipline

60
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,639
of dealing with what is good and bad and

61
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,280
with moral duty and obligation

62
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,840
note that none of these definitions

63
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,720
really speak about

64
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,040
legal or illegal while we use the term

65
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,520
ethical hacker often to

66
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,640
refer to legal hacking but

67
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,800
according to dictionaries legal or

68
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,879
illegal is not necessarily the same as

69
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,360
ethical

70
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,680
so then what is ethical what are the

71
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,519
ethical principles

72
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,280
well we'll go on about that the first

73
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,920
one is beneficials

74
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,080
or doing good to benefit society

75
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,200
do what's right and good and strive

76
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,959
for the greatest amount of good you

77
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,959
could possibly strive for

78
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,879
another principle would be that of the

79
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,239
least harm

80
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,360
so when you can't do good at least do

81
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,760
the least harm you possibly could so

82
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,239
minimizing the negative effects

83
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,239
and there are no good choices try to

84
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,959
make the least bad one

85
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,680
another principle would be respect for

86
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,760
autonomy

87
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,599
so that would be respecting the

88
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,159
capability of the other or in this case

89
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,319
the organization you're disclosing to

90
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,640
to make their own decisions after all

91
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,440
only they

92
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,519
really understand their motivation for

93
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,920
having made certain choices

94
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,080
and the way that they might be dealing

95
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,080
with your report to them

96
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,400
you might not really understand it and

97
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,239
might get frustrated by that

98
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,519
but you have to remember that they know

99
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,200
their own reasons for doing what they're

100
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,640
doing the best

101
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,879
and you can't know all their

102
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,560
considerations or feelings

103
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,080
etc so allow respect their autonomy

104
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,840
and allow and enable them to make the

105
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,480
decision do your disclosure but

106
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,239
don't get too upset if they're not

107
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,080
exactly going to do what you

108
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,879
would want them to do ideally in the

109
00:03:58,879 --> 00:03:59,599
last

110
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,519
ethical principle i wanted to talk about

111
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:02,959
would be justice or

112
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,720
doing the right thing doing the fair

113
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,840
thing and and doing it consistently

114
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,120
so good decisions in an ethical dilemma

115
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,319
are fair

116
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,840
and it should always be the same in

117
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,160
similar cases in my view

118
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,918
so when you have the same kind of

119
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,160
reports two different companies

120
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,199
deliver it in the same way this brings

121
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:23,919
us to

122
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:29,280
different types of um ethical theories

123
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,919
the first one would be deontology or

124
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,120
adhering to one's duty one's obligation

125
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,560
so someone that um follows

126
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,120
ethical theories in this would always be

127
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,080
following the law

128
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,160
and would be very consistent in the

129
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,759
decisions he makes

130
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,759
downsides of these are that there's no

131
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,040
logical basis in it

132
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,280
it's only simple the duty follow the law

133
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,919
obey the obligations that you have but

134
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,840
there's no real

135
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,320
logic and there's a huge potential for

136
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,199
conflict

137
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,759
you could say it's your obligation to be

138
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,440
on time for meetings other people are

139
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,639
expecting you there

140
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,960
you should be on time but what if you're

141
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,680
running late

142
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,919
is it okay to speed to get to your

143
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,680
meeting faster

144
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,400
because you would be you know keeping up

145
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,560
with your obligation of being on time

146
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,639
but then again you would be breaking the

147
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,400
law or breaking the obligation to null

148
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,440
speed

149
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,840
so it doesn't give us a very good

150
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,360
way of making a decision when there's a

151
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,759
conflict which brings us to

152
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:36,720
utilitarianism or the greatest benefits

153
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,080
for the greatest group this

154
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,280
has another set of problems where

155
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,639
you get tried to do the best

156
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,759
for the biggest group but

157
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,520
it means you would have to predict the

158
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,680
exact outcome of all your actions

159
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,520
and you can't always know exactly what

160
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,960
the outcome would be

161
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,680
so predicting that is hard and it

162
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,440
doesn't concern itself with

163
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,039
individuals really it just wants the

164
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,360
best for the greatest group of people

165
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,400
so if you put that into overdrive

166
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,240
you could be talking about a healthy

167
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,639
person walking into a hospital

168
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,400
well you know we should probably take

169
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,160
all his organs and cure seven sick

170
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,120
people

171
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,960
one person suffers but seven people

172
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,319
benefit that would be the

173
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,759
you know greatest benefit for the

174
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,160
greatest group i think we can all agree

175
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,680
that that would clearly not be an

176
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,440
ethical action to do

177
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,240
so these theories too have their own

178
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,600
problem

179
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,440
then there's also theories that concern

180
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,120
about rights

181
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,520
and with rights we take the rights that

182
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,759
are established by society

183
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,759
and they're given the highest priority

184
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:42,960
they need to be protected

185
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,759
and if someone has the right to do

186
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,400
something

187
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,440
one would say it's ethical to do so

188
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,759
but it doesn't really look into how

189
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,280
we're establishing these rights you

190
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:53,919
would need

191
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,560
a secondary ethical theory to lean upon

192
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,280
to

193
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,080
get to and establish these rights so on

194
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,039
its own it's not

195
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,960
still not very useful for making an

196
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,840
ethical decision and it's

197
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,960
actually quite hard to make a

198
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,520
naturalization looking at all these

199
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,039
the last ethical theories are those of

200
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,800
virtue

201
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,440
which means that they mostly look at the

202
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,400
moral

203
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,639
the reputation and the motivation of an

204
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,639
individual

205
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,560
for whether or not actions are right

206
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,120
i would say scott is a good guy he does

207
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,479
the right thing even though this

208
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,080
decision wasn't perfect we'll still

209
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,759
consider it ethical because we consider

210
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,919
scott's an ethical person

211
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,720
this leaves very little room for change

212
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,520
and

213
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,039
it leads us to that actions

214
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,720
from two different people even if

215
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,360
they're the same action or comparable

216
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,800
might be judged differently someone

217
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,479
that's known for

218
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,919
frauds you might judge very harshly for

219
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,560
filing something wrong or as someone

220
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,520
that's known

221
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,520
to not be fraudulent and usually do

222
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,120
things good you might

223
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,520
pass off and say i probably is an honest

224
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,319
mistake

225
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,000
it's the same action but we're judging

226
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,599
vastly different

227
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,039
it also leaves very little room for

228
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,120
change someone might have done something

229
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,879
bad in the past

230
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,560
and then they're still being judged for

231
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,560
that

232
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,479
not considering them to have changed

233
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,160
became a better person grown so

234
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,080
the theories that fall in a virtue are

235
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,240
also very hard to

236
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,320
consistently make good and ethical

237
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,880
decisions

238
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,000
that brings us to how i would personally

239
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,799
try to

240
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,039
make ethical decisions when doing

241
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,399
responsible disclosure

242
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,519
or ethical hacking

243
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,760
in my views your actions should always

244
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,760
be proportional

245
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:55,279
so try to pull only a single database

246
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,959
record instead of dumping an entire

247
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,880
database when you want to prove

248
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,000
something like sql injection they should

249
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,800
also be confidential

250
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,839
if you hack a target don't run to a

251
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,560
journalist

252
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,760
disclose it to them and only

253
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,440
publish about it after everything has

254
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,680
been fixed

255
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,760
and you should always choose means that

256
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,440
are least infringing

257
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,120
it's super cool to have code execution

258
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,720
somewhere but

259
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,920
you probably want to run something

260
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,399
not very interesting instead of popping

261
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,320
an entire shell

262
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,519
you probably if you can have a file

263
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,720
inclusion

264
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,040
want to pull a config file that does not

265
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,880
really contain sensitive data instead of

266
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,279
pulling a password file

267
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,279
and last i think that everybody has a

268
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,839
right to a responsible disclosure

269
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,080
even if i really dislike someone i think

270
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,839
that they're a bad company or a bad

271
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,120
person

272
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,320
um if we find a bug in a scan or

273
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,399
you know see their ip for some

274
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,519
vulnerability

275
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,600
we will still be disclosing to them

276
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,360
considering that everyone has a right to

277
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,079
responsible disclosure

278
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:05,839
which brings me to a practical case in

279
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,640
this case a remote code execution

280
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,320
in the wordpress discus plugin

281
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,560
we had a few options to disclose this or

282
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,160
to scan for it rather

283
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,320
we could check the version this turned

284
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,720
out to be very inconsistent because

285
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,360
uh the plugin needed to be configured in

286
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,440
a certain way to allow you to pop the

287
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,839
remote code execution on it

288
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,880
um so this would have resulted in a lot

289
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,200
of people getting a false notification

290
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,000
that their wordpress site was vulnerable

291
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,480
and we decided that that was not what we

292
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,040
wanted

293
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,279
so just simply checking for the version

294
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,959
of the plugin and notifying based on

295
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,200
that was something we did not

296
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,640
really consider beyond that point it

297
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,079
would have been really nice because we

298
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,519
would have not had to infringe on

299
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,640
anything we could just check the

300
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,839
versions and

301
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,720
send out notifications so our next

302
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,720
option was are we gonna run code

303
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,399
like are we gonna pop the remote card

304
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,320
execution to prove the vulnerability

305
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,200
across

306
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,279
a few hundred sites in our scans that

307
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,800
turned out to be vulnerable to this

308
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,279
we thought about it we would have rather

309
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,720
done something less meaningful we

310
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,399
eventually decided that running

311
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,279
php info was still code execution it

312
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,040
would still prove our point

313
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,640
and it was the least infringing thing we

314
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,480
could think of at that point

315
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,120
so this brings me to the point i made

316
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,160
earlier

317
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,279
is ethical the same as legal is

318
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,880
well running code remote code execution

319
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,560
on someone else's website is

320
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,240
probably not legal i'm afraid

321
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,560
but does that make it unethical i don't

322
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,839
believe so

323
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,079
the goal was to notify them of the

324
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,680
vulnerability

325
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,399
not infringe on any of their rights and

326
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,640
to reach greater benefits of protecting

327
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,200
all the users of their sites

328
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,200
so we considered it to be ethical in

329
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,480
this case to

330
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,240
run a simple php info command on the

331
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,120
servers and then notify website owners

332
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,320
with proof hey

333
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,399
look your plugin is vulnerable you

334
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,079
probably want to update this because

335
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,079
their users their info is a risk

336
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,240
another practical case and this is

337
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,200
probably one that

338
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,920
most of you would have seen is the one

339
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,399
of the i and giggle

340
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,120
that good old giggle hq has a security

341
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,639
theme we don't need random twitter

342
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,320
people

343
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,360
um their disclosure was

344
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,480
in my view absolutely ethical they

345
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,519
did the right thing uh

346
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,440
by warning giggle there's just a lot of

347
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,720
info on that app

348
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,360
and it's really sad to see how the

349
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,200
researchers were treated after

350
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,079
trying to disclose initially not sure if

351
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:42,880
twitter vm

352
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,639
is really the best way to reach a

353
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,160
company

354
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,839
but that's what they had to work with

355
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,800
and uh well things went quickly south

356
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,839
from there

357
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,680
from publicly from reaching out

358
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,240
privately on twitter to being ignored

359
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,959
to sending a quite public reminder to

360
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,279
you know please check your dms

361
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,120
and leading to all the researchers in

362
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,720
the company account being blocked on

363
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,959
twitter by google

364
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:13,440
um which posed the question how ethical

365
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,040
is it to poke at something that

366
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,760
no one really asked you to poke at and

367
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,279
that's a tough call because

368
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,720
you know it's their app it's their

369
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,320
platform you're gonna poke at it

370
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,760
and asked is that ethical i think it can

371
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,000
be defended by the greater good for

372
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
the greatest amount of people because a

373
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,120
lot of innocent

374
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,120
unknowing well-meaning users will be

375
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,560
using the application

376
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,800
and they won't quite be able to you know

377
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,639
judge if it's safe to do so if their

378
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,480
information is stored safely

379
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,560
whereas a researcher will be able to

380
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,000
judge these things and

381
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,079
you know help make the users more safe

382
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,839
so in that view i do think it's ethical

383
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,959
to do but i can definitely see you know

384
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,399
they're being asked questions of hey if

385
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,160
there's no obvious

386
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,399
bug bounty program or other thing giving

387
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,880
you the rights to poke at it

388
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,279
it can be viewed as an ethical one of

389
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,320
the things that

390
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,160
the i wrote on their blog of the writer

391
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,760
of the case that i find very interesting

392
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,240
was

393
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,920
denial is not uncommon when trying to

394
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,399
disclose well this is very obvious

395
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,920
we're used to being ignored and even

396
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,519
getting some pushback

397
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,120
but ultimately we feel it's our

398
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,199
responsibility to persist and ensure the

399
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,519
personal data of users is protected

400
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,199
so it seems they are thinking along the

401
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,279
same ethical lines that i was of

402
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,000
you know protect the users even if the

403
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,959
company

404
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,239
might not want you to do so

405
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,240
and last but not least i have a sort

406
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,680
small personal situation

407
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,680
this has been running for about six

408
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,160
months now that i've pulled the

409
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,199
image that you see from my website it's

410
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,720
their source which is leaking with a

411
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,120
nice array of hard-coded passwords

412
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,720
if you recognize this code please do

413
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,839
answer my emails

414
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,920
um it's quite a sensitive side

415
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,680
it stores a lot of information users

416
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,680
probably don't really want

417
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,720
to see out in the public they have

418
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,800
no clear way to report this they don't

419
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,839
have any social media i can reach out to

420
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:12,000
them

421
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,839
all they really have is their customer

422
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,519
service because they'll

423
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,120
would like to take your credit card and

424
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,480
the customer service is probably quite

425
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,920
helpful if you're having payment issues

426
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,199
i mean i'm sure they're happy to take

427
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,079
your money

428
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,440
but they don't seem quite happy to

429
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,199
answer emails about uh hey

430
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,519
your site's quite broke so customer

431
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,279
service will not give me any technical

432
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,880
contact details

433
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,199
just like tells me it's impossible to

434
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,040
put you in touch with anyone technical

435
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,399
we can't do that

436
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,519
so i eventually decided to disclose my

437
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,120
report of what was going wrong

438
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,360
directly to customer service which is

439
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,639
not something i'm a fan of because

440
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,399
they're clearly not the people that

441
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,519
are going to be able to do something

442
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,839
about it but

443
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,360
nothing happens i have no idea if they

444
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,959
even passed it onto someone technical or

445
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,000
notes i just

446
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,480
never got an answer on that email so

447
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,720
as an exercise for the audience we're

448
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,079
now six months later

449
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,639
and uh i'll leave it up to you what i

450
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,399
could potentially do about this one

451
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,120
because

452
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,800
i can't find people to listen to me so i

453
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,079
just publicly disclose and see it burn

454
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,720
i wonder what you guys think might be

455
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,360
the right way to go about this

456
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,240
and as a final slide do you have any

457
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,920
questions please ask them and i want to

458
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,920
say a big thanks to the beer farmers

459
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,240
sponsors mentors and everyone else

460
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,120
making this possible

461
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,040
thanks leonard uh awesome talk something

462
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,160
i'm quite passionate

463
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,120
about because i've experienced very much

464
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,320
similar things that

465
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,160
you've talked about um and often i think

466
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,000
responsible disclosure can be both

467
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,440
rewarding and extremely frustrating

468
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,120
um so i actually had a question um

469
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,120
but before i do ask it there is a

470
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,560
question from

471
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,040
b uh what is your

472
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,880
what's your take on platforms which

473
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,599
we're using and we find to be vulnerable

474
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,319
and later try to disclose companies

475
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,919
would that be ethical

476
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,439
if so why and if unethical

477
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,559
why i think it's definitely

478
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,240
at school if you're using a platform to

479
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,599
disclose to them

480
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,000
uh i think if you put it out on the

481
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,760
internet then

482
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,919
you're just asking for it to be posted

483
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,919
like someone's gonna do it

484
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,480
so if you're using the platform and you

485
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,080
see a bug somewhere i would absolutely

486
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,480
encourage you to disclose it to them

487
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,480
like write a good report

488
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,200
be as clear as possible in um what you

489
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,480
think is happening and the steps you

490
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,280
took to

491
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,160
reproduce this issue and hope they would

492
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,120
listen i mean

493
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,880
for me it's if it's on the internet and

494
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,160
someone's gonna poke at it

495
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,039
and i think that's okay

496
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,720
i mean that's a good way to look at it

497
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,240
it's not it's not like the attackers are

498
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,160
gonna go oh it's on the internet i don't

499
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,080
own it so i'm not going to poke at it

500
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,039
no i really like the old mantra of

501
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,799
that's out of scope said no attacker

502
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,240
ever

503
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,919
exactly um so i had a question

504
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,320
um it kind of relates to that that issue

505
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,480
that you had um

506
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,039
i i'm fully on board and aware of full

507
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,960
irresponsible disclosure but do you feel

508
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,520
that there comes a point where

509
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,799
you've given them enough opportunity to

510
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,480
address the issue and they're still

511
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,280
ignoring you that possibly going to the

512
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,960
social media might help

513
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,840
like for for example one instance i know

514
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,400
of um

515
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,919
i'll disclose something uh i got ignored

516
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,120
a year later

517
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,840
suddenly exploded on twitter and within

518
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,240
a week or so it was suddenly fixed

519
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,000
i think going on social media for

520
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,679
disclosures is

521
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,720
generally quite bad because as i said i

522
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,039
think

523
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,760
disclosure should be confidential and if

524
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,520
they're ignoring you

525
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,520
a lot you often see is sort of the risk

526
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,120
that people

527
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,799
just go to social media because they're

528
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,480
upset they're annoyed or they want to

529
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,000
stroke their ego and just

530
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,480
show off i think for all those reasons

531
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,480
it can be a bad move to do

532
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,640
but if no one's listening to you and you

533
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,919
can't get in touch

534
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,320
and you think the impact of the issue is

535
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,600
big enough that

536
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,120
it might either be actively abused

537
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,360
or might in short term be actively

538
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,280
abused by people with ill intentions

539
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,880
then i think it's very fair to go on

540
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,320
social media

541
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,679
because you're gonna um mitigate harm by

542
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:30,320
doing it

543
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,520
you would get the problem fixed if the

544
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,960
only way to get it fixed is by going to

545
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,720
social media and calling the company out

546
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,480
then so be it for instance the recent

547
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,679
disclosure of

548
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,360
the donald trump email hack went through

549
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,799
social media because

550
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,559
the researcher felt that he had no other

551
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,640
way to get in touch

552
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,919
like he considered it quite a big risk

553
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,760
that the account was that easy to log

554
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,640
into

555
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,160
especially with the elections coming up

556
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,240
and everything and the consideration was

557
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:58,640
okay

558
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,640
if i do nothing then something

559
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,039
potentially bad can happen

560
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,960
and what's then the only way to get

561
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,559
attention for this one go on to social

562
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:07,679
media

563
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,600
it's sort of the same thing the guys

564
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,320
from the i did when disclosing to giggle

565
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,320
and i think it should absolutely never

566
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,520
be your first stat

567
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,919
but it can be worn in certain scenarios

568
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,200
i hope that answers your question

569
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:21,919
marshall

570
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,799
yeah and i i i completely agree uh my

571
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,880
personal opinion is give them a chance

572
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,080
uh sufficient chance and if not then

573
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,080
try because at the end of the day it's

574
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,559
helping the users more than anything

575
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,480
because they're gonna ultimately be the

576
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,840
ones affected

577
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,400
yeah and by go on social media i mean

578
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,080
call them out and i'll just

579
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,520
zero they drop whatever the

580
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,200
vulnerability was yeah

581
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,400
yeah i would recommend that um it's good

582
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,919
i would not consider that very ethical

583
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:50,720
to be honest

584
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,760
no scott do you have

585
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,120
any questions uh yeah um we got one

586
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,000
through from

587
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,720
nikos um but before i read that one out

588
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,960
i just want to say it's

589
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,640
really important to have the discussion

590
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,480
around vulnerable uh

591
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,960
responsible disclosure and vulnerability

592
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,240
disclosure

593
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,440
uh it's really easy um i know we've said

594
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,039
it a million times i'm kind of bored

595
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,120
saying it but it's really easy to see

596
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,559
something on twitter jump on a bandwagon

597
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:23,600
and be a company around the head even if

598
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,440
they're being ridiculous even if they're

599
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,080
being

600
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,360
objectively stupid compared to us

601
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,720
but as we've heard from multiple

602
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,520
speakers who like gerard like james you

603
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:33,919
know

604
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,440
everybody that is going to come from a

605
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,880
different industry or had a different

606
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,080
experience and goes

607
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,120
here's what your work impacts in this

608
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,600
sense we have no idea how they're taking

609
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,520
it so they could take it as a troll or

610
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,799
as an attack so

611
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,840
having the having the discussion is

612
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,559
really good and

613
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,559
i think mike's talk really ties in

614
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,320
nicely about understanding how your

615
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,000
message is going to be interpreted by

616
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,200
the other side

617
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,000
before you send it um and how you handle

618
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,960
it it's

619
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,039
really important i'll ask nicos's

620
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,000
question now

621
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,520
um any opinions on intermediaries

622
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,840
for responsible disclosure hacker one

623
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,840
etc

624
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,840
if you mean intermediaries those

625
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,440
bug-bounded programs

626
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,480
then i think they're a good thing i'm

627
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,640
not entirely sure if the researchers

628
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,480
really financially benefit from it

629
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,919
and i would personally don't pick it as

630
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,679
a career but

631
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,240
if you mean intermediaries as like just

632
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,320
a company you disclose to and they'll go

633
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,360
and do the entire disclosure for you

634
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,240
i know there's a few of them around um i

635
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,679
prefer not to use them if i have other

636
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:40,000
options

637
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,080
because it means i'm telling a third

638
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,840
party about a bug

639
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,200
before really speaking to the company

640
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,559
that is impacted

641
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,320
so i prefer not to use them but if

642
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,520
there's no other way or if the

643
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,840
disclosure is being

644
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,159
painful and companies being horrible to

645
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,600
work with and i can totally see why you

646
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,120
would use an intermediary and just

647
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,159
know how to deal with that [ __ ] okay

648
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,080
yeah no listen thanks for that um

649
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,679
does anybody else have any questions in

650
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,280
the room for leonard

651
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,960
no i i just want to again say awesome

so yeah thank you thank you for giving

655
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,400
the chance to speak

656
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,159
it's been an absolute pleasure brilliant

657
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,039
yeah and before before um before we wrap

658
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:29,760

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,480
speaking at this

662
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,480
um you and gerard's are the two speakers

663
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,360
um you're both on today but you had like

664
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,120
a slight disadvantage where you were

665
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,799
working for us behind the scenes in the

666
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,240
green room and helping all the other

667
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:46,960
rookies

668
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,799
so you didn't get that whole you got to

669
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,480
set yourself and tweak your slides up to

670
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,840
the last minute you're busy helping

671
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,679
others tweak their slides

672
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,520
massive respect and kudos to you for

673
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,039
that thank you so much we couldn't run

674
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,799
an event without people like you behind

675
00:23:58,799 --> 00:23:59,679
the scenes

676
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,360
thank you so much that was a brilliant

677
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,720
talk mike sean

678
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,200
any last words nothing really can't
