00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,280
a career thing which is super cool

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,200
she's going to talk to us about moving

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,320
from an admin role

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,560
into becoming a security security

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,320
professional at buggy pardon

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,519
so without further ado welcome elizabeth

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,439
and over to you hello everyone

11
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,000
my name is elizabeth and today i would

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,159
like to talk to you about my transition

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,440
from administrator to security analyst

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,760
the graduate apprentice program and why

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,480
is also

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,520
an awesome thing for employers so let's

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,960
start with who am i

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,200
first and most important of all i am a

19
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,520
graduate apprentice security analyst at

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,879
quorum cyber

21
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,960
i'm also a student at edinburgh napier

22
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,120
university currently doing my second

23
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,879
year of cyber security

24
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,600
and working towards my bachelor degree i

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,000
am a mom of two amazing kids that keep

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,840
me busy 24 7

27
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,239
and i am a proud owner of two fluffy

28
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,119
cats

29
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,840
and one crazy pup and a year and a half

30
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,240
ago

31
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,479
i was working as an administrator in the

32
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,080
public sector

33
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,479
now you might wonder why would i want to

34
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:15,600
give up a job

35
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,200
and start the learning process from the

36
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,799
beginning well

37
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,560
in my case i was looking for a stable

38
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,720
career the public sectors are under

39
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,080
constant reviews

40
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,600
looking to save as much money as

41
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,080
possible my department in our local

42
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,840
council was also undergoing these

43
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,560
reviews

44
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,960
which in practical terms meant that i

45
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,720
was on a fixed term contract

46
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,799
and every three months i would wait to

47
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,119
hear whether my contract got extended or

48
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,400
terminated

49
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,159
and when you have a family to support

50
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,680
that's not really an ideal situation

51
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,280
so you might ask why cyber security

52
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,479
in my previous job one of my many

53
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,680
responsibilities was making sure

54
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,560
offices in my team were gdpr compliant

55
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,479
doing financial investigations and

56
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,280
audits

57
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,479
and i really enjoyed that

58
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,479
problem-solving bit of my job

59
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,240
looking for those tiny cash

60
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,759
discrepancies that made

61
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,000
whole budget reconciliations just go

62
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,639
wrong and cyber security seemed like a

63
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,120
field

64
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,200
in a way related to that so i could

65
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,120
transfer some of those soft skills that

66
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,680
i gained in my previous positions

67
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,400
now my journey i guess started around

68
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,560
february 2018

69
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,480
at that time i got promoted to a senior

70
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,920
position still fixed

71
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,640
term and around the same time i joined

72
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,200
google audacity front and web developer

73
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,560
challenge

74
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,400
back then i didn't even know that the

75
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,560
graduate apprentice program existed

76
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,319
and i couldn't afford to just give up my

77
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,400
employment and study full-time

78
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,560
so doing online courses and challenges

79
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,400
like this one in my free time

80
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,480
seemed like the only way to get my feet

81
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,599
into it

82
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,000
and make a slow transition after

83
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,840
completing the challenge i was offered a

84
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,480
place

85
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,959
on the google nanodegree program and i

86
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,280
think back then it cost around 900

87
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,480
pounds to do it

88
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,440
and i was offered it for free so i was

89
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,080
thrilled

90
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,519
and i thought that this would be my

91
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,120
turning point

92
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,599
however due to a series of unfortunate

93
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,400
events

94
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,400
my job turned from full-time to

95
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,000
full-time times too

96
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,720
my manager went off sick long-term and

97
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,480
there was just no replacement

98
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,400
so part of the responsibilities was

99
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,680
shifted onto me

100
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,920
plus i became the first point of contact

101
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,720
for our seven offices across town

102
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,319
so i had to give up the nanodegree

103
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,080
program to cope with the workload

104
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,959
and at that point i just knew that if i

105
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,239
want to make the transition

106
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,959
i just need to jump into deep water i

107
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,120
had to find an entry level position

108
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,440
that would accept me as i was without

109
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,519
much knowledge and with zero experience

110
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,799
in the field

111
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,720
i started my search from the most

112
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,000
popular job sites

113
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,280
s1 jobs total jobs indeed only to find

114
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,599
that the positions closest to entry

115
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,959
level were either graduate or junior

116
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,959
now even though i didn't meet the

117
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,120
requirements i was still applying

118
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,239
hoping that maybe a recruiter would spot

119
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,159
me and take pity on me

120
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,159
and then i came across an apprentice

121
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,280
position

122
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,560
that was posted by qa apprentice

123
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,319
i can't remember what was the exact job

124
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,599
title it was something related to it

125
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,320
i've applied and a few days later i got

126
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,238
a phone call and i can remember the

127
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,358
excitement

128
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,080
i thought this is it i got an interview

129
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,919
someone noticed me

130
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,919
the lady on the phone said that they got

131
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,199
my application and they would

132
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,199
potentially be interested

133
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,320
but she needed to clarify one thing my

134
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,120
age

135
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,120
because looking at my cv it appeared

136
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,880
that i'm over 21

137
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,680
and that was my first pitfall um when i

138
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,360
started to question whether maybe it's

139
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,400
too late for me

140
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,840
to to do a career change i mean

141
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,160
is the age 21 an expiry date for a

142
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,680
person's career

143
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,080
despite that the discouragement i kept

144
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,040
looking

145
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,639
but this time i focused on the word

146
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,080
apprenticeship

147
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,400
i came across apprenticeship scott

148
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,360
website

149
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,680
and that's when i hit jackpot

150
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,039
apprenticeship scott

151
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,600
is a website that provides information

152
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,199
about the apprenticeship program in

153
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,160
scotland

154
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,600
and lists available jobs back in january

155
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,560
2020

156
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,000
there wasn't much jobs in i.t and i have

157
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,199
extended my

158
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,240
search to include glasgow and five

159
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,800
and not just edinburgh where i'm based

160
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,120
and i think back then there was maybe

161
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,320
nine positions in it most of them

162
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,880
were software development related but

163
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,639
one caught my attention

164
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,840
it was a cyber security slash

165
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,280
infrastructure graduate apprentice

166
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,960
so after confirming that my polish

167
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,120
education was just as good as the

168
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,880
scottish a level exams

169
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,199
i got an interview as part of the

170
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,440
interview i had to do a logical test

171
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,919
and answer questions like would i be

172
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,039
able to assemble a pc

173
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,639
in may 2019 i got the job

174
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,160
the job turned out to be more

175
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,680
infrastructure based

176
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,280
but it was a great starting point to

177
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,800
learn about networking

178
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,199
and how it departments look from the

179
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,560
inside

180
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,160
in september 2019 i started my uni

181
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,240
there was only eight of us doing cyber

182
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,400
security as apprentices

183
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,360
and i was the only woman over half of

184
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,960
the people in my group

185
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,440
already had some sort of experience in

186
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,240
i.t

187
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,680
and they were just looking to boost up

188
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,520
their experience and gain some

189
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,039
theoretical knowledge about cyber

190
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,240
security

191
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,479
that was a bit intimidating and i think

192
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:33,600
that at that point i

193
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,360
understood that in order to be

194
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,000
successful i needed to learn a lot and i

195
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,080
needed to learn fast

196
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,960
i felt that my work just wasn't able to

197
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,800
provide me with that

198
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,800
my team was very small and extremely

199
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,000
busy and there

200
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,919
just wasn't enough time to provide me

201
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,840
with a structured training program

202
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,560
and i felt that it would be unfair to

203
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,440
ask for more

204
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,280
when people were stretched above and

205
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,919
beyond with their responsibilities

206
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,720
in january 2020 i attended a

207
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,319
cybersecurity event

208
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,080
organized by napier university the event

209
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,120
was organized

210
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,599
mainly for future graduates and it

211
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,440
offered an opportunity to learn more

212
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,479
about the market

213
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,199
and meet potential employers that's when

214
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,720
i first met quorum cyber

215
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,280
and to be specific that's when i first

216
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,599
met our managing director federico

217
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,520
who at the time was talking about

218
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,639
personal well-being in cyber security

219
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,479
during the break i took the opportunity

220
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,240
to approach every company

221
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,720
and see if they had any apprenticeship

222
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,919
openings

223
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,680
um quorum cyber was the first company

224
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,599
that i've approached um i went over to

225
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:40,479
federico

226
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,800
i've explained my story as briefly as

227
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,680
possible

228
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,199
and that was much briefer than what i'm

229
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,960
doing right now and

230
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,879
i've asked if they had any graduate

231
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,400
apprentice openings

232
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,639
uh i was asked to get in touch with bill

233
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,680
who is our

234
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,960
head of talent i sent over my cv with

235
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,919
a few words about me and my situation

236
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,160
and in february 2020

237
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,280
i was invited over for an interview so

238
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,520
at the interview it turned out that

239
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,960
quorum cyber did not have

240
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,840
any graduate apprentice job openings

241
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,360
they never ever

242
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,599
employed a graduate apprentice but i

243
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,759
think my story caught their attention

244
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,599
and they wanted to learn more about the

245
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,840
program and how it works

246
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,400
in april 2020 i officially became part

247
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,599
of corn cyber

248
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,520
but i think the story of remote

249
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,800
onboarding on

250
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,879
training of new employees during the

251
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,240
pandemic is a topic for another session

252
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,958
so what is graduate apprenticeship

253
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:37,679
basically

254
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,320
you work get faith and study at the same

255
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,200
time

256
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,679
it starts with you finding an employer

257
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,279
or working for an employer

258
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,519
who is willing to support your learning

259
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,200
the employer then fills in an

260
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,640
application

261
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,360
and sends it over to the university that

262
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:53,680
has

263
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,279
an appropriate graduate apprentice

264
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,519
program the application

265
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,920
isn't complicated it's just to confirm

266
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,440
your education

267
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,160
company details and personal details the

268
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,600
university then applies to the

269
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,720
government

270
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,720
to get the funds to pay for your

271
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,160
university fees

272
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,920
in scotland this is done through skills

273
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,839
development scotland

274
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,399
then at the end of every academical year

275
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,240
the university fills in a progress

276
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,680
report together with you

277
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,680
and your employer and returns it to the

278
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,160
government to keep the funds coming

279
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,480
a very important thing to remember is

280
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,920
that the funds

281
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,560
for your tuition fees are linked to you

282
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,440
as a person

283
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,279
not to your employer or to the

284
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,480
university

285
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,640
so at any point during your journey you

286
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,120
need to change universities or employers

287
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,760
it is possible assuming that the

288
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,440
university you're moving to

289
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,680
has a graduate apprentice program and is

290
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,760
willing to transfer you over

291
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,760
or if you're changing the employers

292
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,519
assuming that your new employer will

293
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,399
support you

294
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,320
and your learning process and will

295
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,720
provide you with a release from work

296
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,160
to complete your university studies

297
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,240
so how does the program work i've

298
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,680
mentioned that the employer needs to

299
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,800
release you

300
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,399
from work to complete the university

301
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,920
studies now the

302
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,640
apprentice program is designed so that

303
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,399
all of your university modules

304
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,480
are compressed into one day so

305
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,920
effectively the employer needs to

306
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,079
release you only one day per week for

307
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,560
you to go to university

308
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,800
however don't be fooled thinking that

309
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,640
it's only one day that you need to

310
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,160
complete your degree

311
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,720
on top of that you will need few hours

312
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,959
every week to read through material

313
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,600
or prepare for assessment review for

314
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,839
exams or code

315
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,680
the modules that consist of your program

316
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,519
will be different depending on what

317
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,200
university you're studying at

318
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,399
so cyber security at napier will have

319
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,079
a bit different modules compared to

320
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,160
glasgow university

321
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,959
now you might think how is it possible

322
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,720
that you're studying only one day per

323
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,279
week

324
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,720
and you get the same diploma as

325
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,720
full-time students

326
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,519
well the graduate apprentice program is

327
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,000
built

328
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,399
around the learning experience and in

329
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,320
order to make this work-based learning

330
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,760
experience valid

331
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,480
universities created modules like

332
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,160
professional practice

333
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,800
where you document and write reports on

334
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,720
what skills and what experience

335
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,920
you've learned in your workspace you

336
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,000
don't have to be a rookie to do it

337
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,480
as i've mentioned in my group there are

338
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,040
people who already had experience in it

339
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,480
and they were just looking to boost up

340
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,200
their skills there's also an option to

341
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,440
start your bachelor degree from second

342
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,079
year

343
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,640
or you can do your master's degree in an

344
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,720
apprentice mode with a one day release

345
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,760
to do your university work there is no

346
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,040
upper age limit

347
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,440
and i think that this photo taken during

348
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,560
a group work

349
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,519
last year at university gives a great

350
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,200
image of the gender

351
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,399
and age diversity

352
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,959
now as much as i love the graduate

353
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,160
apprentice program

354
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,920
and as much as i want to sell it to you

355
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,480
all i need to come clean about something

356
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,560
now you probably heard of a term

357
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,000
work-life balance

358
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,600
and in my head it looks something like

359
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,000
this installation of a tight wire walker

360
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,279
in my hometown now in my world ever

361
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,040
since i became a graduate apprentice

362
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,120
there is no such thing as balance

363
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,959
and i think this applies to most of

364
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,680
people in it in the current times

365
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,720
with so many things going on it's more

366
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,120
about

367
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,200
tuning in or tuning out different

368
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,959
aspects of my life

369
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,040
sacrificing free time to learn and i

370
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,920
mean there is a lot to learn

371
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,240
so what's in it for you i've talked

372
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,360
about the cons

373
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,680
the workloads the sacrifices that come

374
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,959
with the commitment

375
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,519
so now let's talk about the pros first

376
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:44,240
of all

377
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,079
you earn money you don't have to give up

378
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,920
your employment to do a full-time

379
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,279
university course

380
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,959
how much you earn will depend on your

381
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,320
level of experience

382
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,639
and will be set up by your employer it's

383
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,880
a great networking opportunity

384
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,680
you get a degree and a diploma and with

385
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,360
the diploma you also have

386
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,320
four years of working experience putting

387
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,480
you way ahead of full-time students

388
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,120
and you learn you learn a lot and even

389
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,200
if you already have experience in it

390
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,040
there will be still new things that this

391
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,959
program will teach you

392
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,279
now a bit about the link in the top

393
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,399
right corner

394
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,079
whether you're thinking of changing your

395
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,760
career path or

396
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,519
you're already in the process just as i

397
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,079
am you will have your ups and downs

398
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,800
and believe me when i tell you um from

399
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,839
my own experience

400
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,839
everyone gets their downs and their

401
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,440
doubts and

402
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,000
what you need then is a good pep talk

403
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,560
for me

404
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,199
it's this video from a ted conference

405
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,920
well

406
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,880
mel robbins talks about how to make

407
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,800
changes in your life happen

408
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,800
with her mantra being getting what you

409
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,279
want is simple it's not easy but it's

410
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,079
simple

411
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,079
now in my case it was as simple as

412
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,680
quitting my job and joining the

413
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,880
apprentice program

414
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,440
it wasn't easy but it was as simple as

415
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,519
that

416
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,279
now this part of my presentation is

417
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,519
directed to employers

418
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,360
i could bore you to death with

419
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,560
statistics

420
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,639
and if your brain is just like mine

421
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,560
you'll switch off and wake up at the end

422
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,160
of the presentation

423
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,600
and some of you will agree with the

424
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,839
statement that there is a skills gap in

425
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,040
cyber security

426
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,680
and some of you will strongly disagree

427
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,160
um

428
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,560
and say how easy it was to fill in cyber

429
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,399
security posts in your company

430
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,959
but i think we'll all agree with an

431
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,680
opinion that the cyber security industry

432
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,440
is still in its early stages and will

433
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,279
keep growing and expanding

434
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,199
with every new piece of software newly

435
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,800
developed technologies

436
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,040
and new laws like gdpr there comes an

437
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,480
immediate need for

438
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,639
cyber security solutions to prevent

439
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,000
cyber crime or

440
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,160
misuse of technologies or data so

441
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,079
creating entry-level positions

442
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,639
like graduate apprenticeship will allow

443
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,600
the industry

444
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,079
not to be only dependent on university

445
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,399
graduates fueling the market

446
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,240
must i also mention that employing an

447
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,839
apprentice will save you money

448
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,240
and you will help the economy by

449
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,199
allowing people

450
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,440
looking for a university degree to work

451
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,360
as an apprentice while studying

452
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,440
you put them in the tax system four

453
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,480
years earlier

454
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,800
than if they would study full-time

455
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,480
companies will be able to shape the

456
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,320
industry by allowing people such as

457
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,199
myself

458
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,040
to re-qualify the word sustainability

459
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,199
is very popular and trendy and i think

460
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,040
it should also be applied when we talk

461
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:25,440
about

462
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,240
job markets and creating opportunities

463
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,759
during my time of work in the public

464
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,680
sector i've heard people complaining on

465
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,279
numerous occasions about

466
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,680
how software and technologies leave

467
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,399
people without

468
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,040
jobs simply because automation makes the

469
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,959
processes easier to manage

470
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,279
by creating apprenticeship positions we

471
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,560
are being sustainable

472
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,720
we are allowing these people who might

473
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,040
become jobless or are jobless

474
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,360
because of technology or economical

475
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,240
changes

476
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,720
to re-qualify and utilize their very

477
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,240
valuable skill set

478
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,240
skill set that many freshly graduate

479
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,920
students will lack

480
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,920
maybe in the future it won't matter what

481
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,360
university you've finished

482
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,120
harvard or oxford or napier or mit

483
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,120
but what company trained you to become

484
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,040
who you are

485
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,279
this is the end of my presentation but

486
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,120
it's just the beginning of my journey

487
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,639
and cyber security

488
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,959
i hope you've enjoyed my story and maybe

489
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,880
it served as an inspiration for people

490
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,800
looking for a career change or

491
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,639
employers looking to expand their teams

492
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,880
or boost their employees skill set

493
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,560
to make this presentation even more

494
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,639
memorable i have prepared a joke

495
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,279
where did the hacker go he ran somewhere

496
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,320
i would also like to give many thanks to

and

538
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,720
you know it's great seeing a journey a

539
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,840
career path

540
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,240
you know from where you were and some of

541
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,760
the struggles and difficulties that you

542
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,240
had

543
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,960
into what appears to be very clearly a

544
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,160
much better place you

545
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,400
obviously very happy in your career your

546
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,919
life in general you're working for a

547
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,280
great organization

548
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,280
so yeah kudos to you for being able to

549
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,480
make that leap

550
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,320
um but keeping everything in perspective

551
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,240
as well at the same time so yeah very

552
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,039
well done there

553
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,080
do we get any questions uh

554
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,240
none on slack everybody's just saying

555
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,400
this is a really inspirational story

556
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,840
um one anonymous person though did say

557
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,000
as an employer of graduate apprentices

558
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,039
they are also driven

559
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,360
by the awesome people who give great

560
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,960
talks so

561
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,039
that came from an anonymous person no

562
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,280
idea who it was just don't share that

563
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,799
um but no i i have a quick comment on

564
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,320
well people are probably going oh let's

565
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,799
get the questions in there um

566
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,440
you mentioned that um others already had

567
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,200
a grounding or a qualification or some

568
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,799
sort of background in cyber security and

569
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:01,679
wanted to just

570
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,520
kind of get that piece of paper or that

571
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,160
background or that additional book

572
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,559
um but you obviously came at it from a

573
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:09,440
different angle

574
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,760
do you think that was advantageous to

575
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,640
you

576
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,240
whereas people were kind of stuck in

577
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,320
this mindset and you were kind of open

578
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,240
and just like a sponge taking everything

579
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,679
in

580
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,799
um it's it's difficult to say i mean

581
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:23,679
some of the people

582
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,240
for example had a networking background

583
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,799
and i think in cyber security

584
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,200
it's important to understand the traffic

585
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,960
flow of information

586
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,919
and it can make it easier to detect

587
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,320
stuff when you know how networks behave

588
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,919
and what's expected and what's not

589
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,600
expected um

590
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,559
for me everything is new so sometimes

591
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,160
there are subjects which

592
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,039
um the guys with the id background will

593
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,000
roll their eyes

594
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,160
and think oh my god we have to do this

595
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,400
or this is pointless to learn

596
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,400
programming or scripting and for me

597
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,280
everything is new and i want to just

598
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,000
inhale

599
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,919
everything that i can and learn

600
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,520
everything that i can

601
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,520
so i think the advantage of not coming

602
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,039
from an i.t background

603
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,240
is that everything's exciting for you

604
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,159
i i think that's that's that's really

605
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,000
nice though i mean can

606
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,520
for example the boring stuff that we

607
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,280
have to do day in day out it can get

608
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,039
quite monotonous but working alongside

609
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,000
someone that's like oh my

610
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,080
god this is so cool even if it's boring

611
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,280
to me like that would

612
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,520
really you know it could spur you on so

613
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,720
that's that's awesome i think

614
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,320
sean had a question yeah i i had one

615
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,520
um so scott kind of touched on this

616
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,400
in our opening remarks that the industry

617
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,240
is often seen as very toxic

618
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,000
you got gatekeepers and that and there

619
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,080
certainly are instances of that

620
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,559
i'm just wondering from your perspective

621
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,799
since you've come into the industry as

622
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,400
a new person and you don't

623
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,120
have that sort of background associated

624
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,320
with yourself

625
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,720
what's it been like for you have you had

626
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,640
any issues

627
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,440
um i think my biggest issue was just

628
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,720
putting my foot

629
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,919
in the door and getting this

630
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,120
first opportunity to to start the work

631
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,679
in it it's difficult when you don't have

632
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,200
any sort of i.t related background

633
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,799
or like a feasible

634
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,559
level of certificates or knowledge to

635
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,320
convince the employers that your soft

636
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,159
skills are valuable

637
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,720
and that you're willing to learn stuff

638
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,360
and

639
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,400
um i think that my background i mean i

640
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,320
worked in customer service i worked as

641
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,919
an admin i worked as an optical

642
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,159
assistant at one point in my life

643
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,720
and i think that all of that experience

644
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,520
uh

645
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,280
made me a good employee in a way because

646
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,840
like doing this talk

647
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,679
did not freak me out as much as it

648
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,039
probably would freak out

649
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,760
anyone else who didn't have any working

650
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,880
experience

651
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,720
i'm good with like sorting stuff and

652
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,400
organizing stuff and i

653
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,679
love looking for like you know

654
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:03,520
irregularities because of my background

655
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,960
um so i i also love

656
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,000
the the community and cyber security um

657
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,159
i mean when i was working as an admin we

658
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:13,840
didn't have these groups we didn't have

659
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,679
confidences where people talked about

660
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:16,400
you know

661
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,120
reconciliation of budgets uh but in

662
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,200
cyber security it seems that

663
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,000
those small communities are very lively

664
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,559
and

665
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,320
they're very welcoming at least from my

666
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,400
perspective

667
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,440
ah that's that's awesome um because so

668
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,440
often there's the negativity that drowns

669
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:33,840
out

670
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,720
the positivity and that to me at least

671
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,120
the negativity is only a small portion

672
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,280
just look at today there's huge amounts

673
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,559
of people involved

674
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,960
and it's just nothing but positivity so

675
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,039
it's really encouraging to hear that

676
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,080
so thank you 100 sure um

677
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,000
and i guess the last point i'd like to

678
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,760
make is that you are living proof

679
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,480
elizabeth

680
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,720
that people can make a success of a

681
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,760
career

682
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,960
