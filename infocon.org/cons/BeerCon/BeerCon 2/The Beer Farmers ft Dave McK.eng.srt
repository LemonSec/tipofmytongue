1
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:04,960
hello

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,879
welcome back um we're going to do

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,160
something a little bit different now uh

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,440
have a break from the main talks and

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:09,920
just do

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,320
a little bit of a panel for you and the

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,160
subject of the panel is going to be the

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,079
i guess the good the man in the ugly of

9
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,920
the talks that we've been involved in as

10
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,720
a group

11
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,199
um we the beer farmers have done a lot

12
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,199
of talks in the last 18 months two years

13
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,800
or up and down the country

14
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,880
and so sean and i are probably going to

15
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,320
share a few of our little experiences

16
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,519
around that

17
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,119
dave's got his stuff to talk about

18
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,640
obviously scott's relatively new to the

19
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,360
band but

20
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,440
um has got many stories and so i'm going

21
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,800
to hand it to scott right now and he's

22
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,800
going to start

23
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,920
yeah um if you saw the intro cards

24
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,239
someone anybody in the uk will probably

25
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,840
be very familiar with that story

26
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,079
it was a few years ago a fair few years

27
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:48,879
ago now

28
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,920
on the bbc um this guy

29
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,320
turned up and he looked like he didn't

30
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,120
belong there

31
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,680
um and the interview was a complete

32
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,640
train wreck

33
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,359
and it turned out later that uh he was

34
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,239
he was actually just

35
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,840
there for a job they went into the

36
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,280
interview room the green room they said

37
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,799
all right your name's guy yep that's not

38
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,000
a problem you know shove you in the

39
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,720
green room

40
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,920
um and he went on and he was billed as

41
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,520
this expert in

42
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,600
apple music i think and apple's

43
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,960
streaming services

44
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,640
and it turned out he was applying for a

45
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,560
technical job at the bbc and it turned

46
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:20,960
out

47
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,560
you know he just happened to share the

48
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,400
same first name as the other guy

49
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,880
um the guy blagged it really really

50
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,759
really well

51
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,240
and that kind of leads me on to

52
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,920
something that happened to me about

53
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,240
three years ago um i get booked for

54
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,200
radio

55
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,280
uh quite regularly they phone you up and

56
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,560
they say hey we've got

57
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,360
this interview slot this time this is a

58
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,000
topic

59
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,920
here's the host are you comfortable yeah

60
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,399
that's good and they throw you on

61
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,320
well this one particular day a very

62
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,000
similar situation happened to me where

63
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,200
was a guy

64
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,240
called scott on before me talking about

65
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,240
stocks and shares and the stock market

66
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:56,799
and the

67
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,640
stock price with the current political

68
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,040
climate etc etc

69
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,000
um unfortunately producer of the show

70
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,520
switched us both around

71
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,560
um he got this cyber security segment

72
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,959
and managed to blag it pretty well and

73
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,480
it came to me and it was like okay so

74
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,200
you know

75
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,959
here's apple and i'm thinking okay

76
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,800
that's fine i can talk about apple

77
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,640
you know this their stock price has just

78
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,480
plummeted in the last 24 hours what do

79
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,000
you think about it like i don't

80
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,520
care i really don't care

81
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,360
but i had to blag it 10 minutes of

82
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,840
interview on national radio

83
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,760
um and it was clear the host was like

84
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,120
this guy doesn't know what the hell he's

85
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,239
talking about

86
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,720
um and then afterwards the producer

87
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,959
realized the mistake and

88
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,599
massively apologized but for 10 minutes

89
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,360
somewhere out there there's a recording

90
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,120
of me blagging it about stocks and

91
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,080
shares

92
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,959
recommending what people invest in next

93
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,800
um you know is this a good start to

94
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,840
invest in i'm like yeah

95
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,760
sounds good great to me you know just

96
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,360
yeah go for it whatever you think you do

97
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,560
you man

98
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,640
that's it for 10 minutes it's just me

99
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,720
just big shruggy shoulders and national

100
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,200
tv

101
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,400
it was absolutely the most

102
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,800
petrifying moment of my life being put

103
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,159
in the spot but i think

104
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,519
you guys have some absolute crackers to

105
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,800
share yeah

106
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,200
i'm gonna go back to my first ever um

107
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,159
public talk

108
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,720
which was at b-sides london um in 2018

109
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,560
and that that's not a small thing right

110
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,720
but your first talk being

111
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,519
a big b size london talk and i think i

112
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:30,720
applied for a rookie

113
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,720
talk and got thrown on one of the main

114
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,560
tracks which was kind of like oh that's

115
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,360
cool

116
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,680
um not sure i deserve this but i'll do

117
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,879
it anyway

118
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,120
um so i got down there got involved in

119
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,040
all the buzz and met a few people i knew

120
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,799
and hung out and stuff and it was really

121
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,159
really good fun

122
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,760
um and then started to get more and more

123
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,519
nervous as the day went i think i was on

124
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,360
like mid-afternoon

125
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,760
and we were upstairs in the i like it on

126
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,200
if you're familiar with the venue but

127
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,480
uh on the first floor and um

128
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,360
i was on directly after andy gill

129
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,959
zephyrfish who

130
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,920
many of you will know um fairly well

131
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,480
known

132
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,120
in sick person and so we went up to the

133
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,400
room to scope out and

134
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,480
you know do your kind of thing work out

135
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,599
what you're gonna where you're gonna

136
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,080
stand

137
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,079
and what the room dynamic looks like and

138
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,279
we noticed something important was

139
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,079
missing

140
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,880
um there was no camera and no recording

141
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,440
equipment

142
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,680
and we'd been told specifically that we

143
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,680
were gonna have the talks recorded

144
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,400
and then that was a bit weird and andy

145
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:28,960
was

146
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,960
rather less than happy with that because

147
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,400
he was planning to record all of his

148
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,840
talks that year and then published him

149
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,320
out

150
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,919
because he was doing like back to back

151
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,360
but different subjects at each

152
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,560
conference that he was talking so he

153
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,080
wanted a record of that

154
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,080
um in the end he filmed his own talk on

155
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,280
his phone

156
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,800
and i think he ended up with an 85

157
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,120
gigabyte file on his phone that he had

158
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,400
to deal with

159
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,479
and and then i went afterwards and had

160
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:51,520
to deliver the talk

161
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,520
and i was petrified absolutely i was

162
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,040
stood hanging onto the

163
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,000
the desk with my pc on it and i was just

164
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,120
if you'd have been close enough to me

165
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,680
you'd

166
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,199
see me visibly moving around um

167
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,720
and it was bad but the talk was

168
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,160
brilliant because once i'd got through

169
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,880
the opening

170
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,560
minute two minutes i was kind of in the

171
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,720
flow of it and started to understand

172
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,000
that people had come here because they

173
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,199
were interested in what i was going to

174
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,039
say and the talk went really well

175
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,759
in actual fact when i think back on that

176
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,680
i'm glad it didn't get recorded

177
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,280
because my body language was pretty

178
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,600
terrible you know purely down the nerves

179
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,840
and so i guess the point of that

180
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,039
anecdote

181
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,960
is that it takes a whole lot of bravery

182
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,600
to do what our rookies have done

183
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,600
here which is to come onto a virtual

184
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,120
conference with

185
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,960
hundreds of people watching it and have

186
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,800
it recorded so that's an absolute credit

187
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,919
to those people because

188
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,400
i've been there and i had probably an

189
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,240
easier ride than some of you people

190
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,600
because i didn't get it recorded there

191
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,520
was no evidence no video evidence of me

192
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,880
panicking or any of that kind of stuff

193
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,440
so

194
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,479
that went down quite well um a couple

195
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,639
more quick stories so

196
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,319
we did a lot of the b-sides gigs as the

197
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,800
beer farmers um

198
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,600
i think mostly last year and we did a

199
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,919
particularly fun one at edinburgh napier

200
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,479
university and that's the later hack

201
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:07,440
conference which

202
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,759
was a really well organized conference

203
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,759
organized by the the student community

204
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,680
up at that particular university

205
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,720
and some of the um alumni people

206
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,840
but they did this um yeah you got lunch

207
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,759
and all that kind of stuff and

208
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,800
there was a a very large beer rider

209
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,680
for those of you who don't know what a

210
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,520
rider is it's something provided at a

211
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,080
venue

212
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,280
for people to enjoy

213
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,280
so shame ian's not here because ian

214
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,520
brought a magic coat with him

215
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,919
and it was some kind of military jacket

216
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,680
and the design of it meant that you

217
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,479
could put

218
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,880
well effectively ammunition magazines

219
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,840
all over it

220
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,720
and what ian decided to do was rather

221
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,360
than put

222
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,120
ammunition in there and put cans of beer

223
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,280
in there so he went and emptied the

224
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,479
table of beer

225
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,800
and filled all these pockets and i think

226
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,520
he had around

227
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,800
30 cans of beer in his coat and he was

228
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,000
walking around

229
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,720
like he had a problem which clearly did

230
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,680
and um

231
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,039
and that was pretty much the story of

232
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,960
the day and then when the uh

233
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,880
the coat got emptied we went back and

234
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,400
filled it up again

235
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,919
and walked around all the talks now we

236
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,520
gave a talk there and it was it was

237
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,080
really good

238
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,000
really enjoyed it but there was this one

239
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,599
incident and there was a guy giving a

240
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,360
talk about analyzing data and images

241
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,240
steganography

242
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,160
and um he was doing this really detailed

243
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,080
talk about how you only need a partial

244
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,800
pa a little

245
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,080
part of an image and you can then

246
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,599
extrapolate the rest of it out into a

247
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:30,800
bigger picture and

248
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,400
pretty fascinating deeply technical

249
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,240
stuff i think the guy was a rookie

250
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,520
himself so you know probably got the

251
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,479
rookie nerves

252
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,319
and then ian a bear in mind he brought

253
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,599
about 15 cans in

254
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,919
at this point um opened a can dropped it

255
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,440
in the auditorium

256
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,520
but it didn't happen quietly it exploded

257
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,879
on the floor

258
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,240
midway through this guy's talk and we

259
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,319
were in the front row as well

260
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,639
so just this horrible explosion and all

261
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,840
ian did and i don't know if

262
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,280
i'm not sure if it ever got recorded or

263
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,440
not he went don't worry i've got some

264
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,680
more

265
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,599
and that happened that's a true story um

266
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:06,479
that was all he

267
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,240
particularly cared about and i think he

268
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,759
said did anyone hear that

269
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,000
yeah like 150 people in the room heard

270
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,960
it the guy at the front

271
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,560
talking he heard it you know people out

272
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,199
in the in the university campus heard it

273
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,440
um so that was funny and then the last

274
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,960
one from me really is around

275
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,080
what happened to us at steelcon in 2019

276
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,639
so we've got video evidence of this go

277
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,240
go look at our youtube channel and

278
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,599
you'll see

279
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,120
that we we presented a brand new talk

280
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,320
at steelcom so we're all quite agitated

281
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,839
and and uh hoping that it'd be

282
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:40,000
successful

283
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,519
and we're on stage and we're just

284
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,719
waiting to start the conference

285
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,159
literally minutes before we were going

286
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,360
to start doing the talk

287
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,839
and um one of the organizers woody ran

288
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,120
on

289
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,320
and um with a whiskey each which was

290
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:52,720
like

291
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,399
dutch courage why not we all have some

292
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,760
of that because andy gillard had a

293
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,399
whiskey

294
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,839
and he didn't seem to be having any

295
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,240
trouble so we had this whiskey

296
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,360
and down in one like you do

297
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,839
and sean started struggling pretty

298
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:06,399
quickly

299
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,640
after after taking this drink and then

300
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,240
ian started complaining about

301
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,279
sort of abdominal pain

302
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,680
and then i didn't drink it straight away

303
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,279
i waited until pressing go on the

304
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,640
presentation and then

305
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,839
bottoms up and then struggled and

306
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,519
struggled and got worse and then the

307
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,200
hiccups started the coughing started

308
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,519
this

309
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,959
the eyes started to stream um

310
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,200
voice went i went up like five octaves

311
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,160
in my voice

312
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,760
and then couldn't see at one point and

313
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,360
then the laptop shut the bed

314
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,959
stopped working the slide deck wouldn't

315
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,240
work we had a video that we're really

316
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,680
proud of that i didn't play

317
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,760
i went to get their it people on stage

318
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,920
to fix everything reboot the laptop

319
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,680
and i think it get into our talk by

320
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,440
about 10 minutes it was just

321
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,800
hanging around falling apart on stage um

322
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,640
and the reason was that the the fine

323
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,640
japanese 29 year old japanese whiskey

324
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,839
that we thought we were drinking was

325
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,120
actually 500 000

326
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,480
scoville naga viper vodka and we got

327
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,680
spiked

328
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,079
and the lesson of that particular day

329
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:05,680
was be careful what you drink when

330
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,200
you're offered something at a

331
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,600
hacker's conference right uh it was

332
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,480
pretty bad

333
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,000
and immediately after the we've done the

334
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,480
talk which went well in the end

335
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,360
ian said i've just got to go freshen up

336
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,519
which was an interesting statement

337
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,120
and what he had what he meant was he had

338
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,040
to go and um use one of

339
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,600
ben's japanese toilets in a rather

340
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,959
urgent fashion

341
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,800
um and i thought that's a really weird

342
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,720
reaction sean got away with it

343
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,720
actually pretty much and then i got away

344
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,320
with it until around about

345
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,079
6 30 in the evening when we were down at

346
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,760
the after party

347
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,120
and we'd eaten a bit of food i'm going

348
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,360
to drink and stuff and i thought

349
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,399
hang on a minute i've got a problem and

350
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:44,959
i ran

351
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,720
literally sideways through the building

352
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,399
asking people where the toilet was

353
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,399
and eventually got into the toilet not

354
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,240
gonna go into too much of the

355
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,040
gory detail but the upshot of that was

356
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,720
that the security guard

357
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,000
came and knocked on the door and said

358
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
are you all right mate because i was

359
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,040
making a lot of noise

360
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,279
and um yeah i'm fine fine

361
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,040
and yeah so the moral of that story is

362
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,800
if somebody hands you a beverage

363
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,360
conference nah get them to try it before

364
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,240
you try it

365
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,839
and that's my stories really

366
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,160
yeah epic fail don't drink something you

367
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,360
don't know where it came from

368
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,440
no absolutely you do you do it first

369
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,040
yeah

370
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,240
your second life story there was

371
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,040
you know like like ian dropping the the

372
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,480
can of beer in the conference

373
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,920
uh my one was big

374
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,399
kind of like country-wide roadshow thing

375
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,279
and i'm standing there

376
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,120
like like talking and i think it was

377
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,040
about like internet filtering

378
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,680
and you know you know if you if you

379
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,880
block it there they're still going to

380
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,399
get to the stuff and all this and so

381
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:48,880
we're sitting

382
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,079
like and i think it was like six

383
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,880
six things at six versions of this end

384
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,120
so it was all coming really smooth and

385
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,200
really easy and you didn't really

386
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,279
the nerves had kind of disappeared it's

387
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,800
still there you're about to go on stage

388
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,839
but

389
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,360
about five minutes in like there's a

390
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,720
pause like you know you're flicking a

391
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,000
slide or something like that and then

392
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,920
all i hear from the back is this oh i

393
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,839
could listen to his accent

394
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,200
all day these two

395
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,760
like elderly women sitting at the back

396
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,040
and it was just like

397
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,760
perfect silent but just had just

398
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,880
literally stopped

399
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,200
nobody was saying anything and this this

400
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,399
just floated

401
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,440
across the back and of course

402
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,639
a double-taking goal

403
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,680
like one the talk like okay and i'm

404
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,639
certainly going there

405
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,079
and then of course everybody in the room

406
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,079
just turned around and these two women

407
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,639
just like bright reds

408
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,880
so i think there's like that i'll give

409
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,200
him a number later

410
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,120
what you do is just completely

411
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,240
yes scott will obviously will back me up

412
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,839
like scotsman whenever we go in the

413
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,519
world people love to listen to us it's

414
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,200
absolutely fine but yeah

415
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,560
straight in the middle of my talk and i

416
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,279
was like oh hello right that's

417
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,079
what would you what do you do to that

418
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,680
he's just sitting on that

419
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,440
carry on regardless because there's

420
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,880
nothing else you can do

421
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,040
and then let's get back to talking about

422
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,639
internet filtering

423
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,600
and so yeah absolutely brutal but

424
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,279
completely

425
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,720
both and i think and in a talk random

426
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,839
stuff does happen and when you're

427
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:28,800
standing there

428
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,639
you just have to deal with it i mean you

429
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:31,920
look ben had

430
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,480
the weird zoom issues before and the man

431
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,000
dealt with it and then went on like a

432
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,800
trooper

433
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,480
he's been really nervous all week and

434
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,079
stuff of that about doing it last couple

435
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,040
of weeks we've been giving him like

436
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,880
momentum sessions and

437
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,320
like you know just sitting going through

438
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,720
it and within five minutes he was like

439
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,120
don't

440
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,519
running absolutely through and you do

441
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,519
you would never have guessed that ben

442
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,320
this was his first talk and all the

443
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,839
rookies a lot i mean uh

444
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,600
all the maintenance sessions and stuff

445
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,560
we've been doing with them and stuff

446
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,079
like that you just certainly gonna

447
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,360
a couple of them i've actually just

448
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,199
turned and set and going there

449
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,839
are you sure you've not done this before

450
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,839
because the quality of the talks and the

451
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:08,399
way

452
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,160
everything is absolutely absolutely

453
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,920
perfect i know if all the rookies are

454
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,360
sitting there just now

455
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,120
going all right i'm coming up and coming

456
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,040
up i'm coming up and oh god i need to be

457
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,480
to tomorrow and stuff like that

458
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,160
but they're all doing absolutely

459
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,760
fantastically i mean

460
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,240
they're all super prepped way more

461
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,360
prepped than

462
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,480
than i have i mean i i doubt anybody in

463
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,000
this room hasn't

464
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,880
been editing the slides in 15 minutes

465
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,399
before you're actually

466
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,360
going on uh i mean you're certainly

467
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,000
going that

468
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,920
if if somebody says i haven't edited my

469
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,680
slides three hours before going on

470
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,079
you're a liar or you've never done any

471
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:44,880
talks

472
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,240
and then you can certainly go that i've

473
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,120
literally been editing my slides as i go

474
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,720

amazing they're all

482
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,000

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,720
days

490
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,040
i mean the one time i've been super

491
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,160

about that i'll do this but you do that

506
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,880
but and then i went

507
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,000
and actually in inside 48 hours my

508
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,600
slides were done

509
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,600
i actually sat there and forgot about it

510
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,880
for like a month and a half and people

511
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,480
emailed me backwards and forwards and he

512
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,000
you need anything like no

513
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,079
completely prepped i am for once

514
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,600
completely ready and then the day before

515
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,199
they said can you send over the slides

516
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,040
oh by the way they need to be in 800 by

517
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,839
600 to go on our projector

518
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,680
and what dude sorry did you say 800 by

519
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,880
600

520
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,399
like yeah yeah it's quite an old

521
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,759
projector we've got in the boardroom

522
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,480
when we're doing it and i'm like

523
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,199
right okay and then i kind of turn

524
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,320
around as well

525
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,000
i've got the old branding on my slides

526
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,639
anyway i should use the new branding

527
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,880
if i'm going to be redoing any slides

528
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,920
and so i'll pull the

529
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,079
template across from the market people

530
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,440
i'm like hey yeah he said look at it and

531
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,240
going

532
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,160
you're trying to put in 800 by 600 and

533
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,279
you're just sitting on the little

534
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,040
watermarks and stuff that you've got

535
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,199
in the back here like presentation or

536
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,040
like halfway across the screen or not

537
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,800
even making it onto the screen anymore

538
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,920
and you're like

539
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,920
what am i yeah and you're saying that i

540
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,959
actually like

541
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,279
credit to the market in person at the

542
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,360
time and she knows who she is

543
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,160
but she actually turned and said look

544
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:54,800
you're

545
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,800
i need to do this talk i actually

546
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,959
everything's done i know what it is

547
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,720
but i have to try and somehow fit all

548
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,079
this stuff on and i need

549
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,480
800 by 600 she did a double take and

550
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,480
then like 45 minutes i have no idea how

551
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,599
she made it but

552
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,319
it looked proper she probably did

553
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,000
something in photoshop more than

554
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,400
anything but it was just that how did

555
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,199
you make

556
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,280
it still look like a normal presentation

557
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,119
but 800x600

558
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,880
but yeah the i yeah everybody

559
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,720
is is still i know they've achieved

560
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,160
everyone's slack going all right i'm you

561
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,359
know i'm changing this i'm changing

562
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,480
that's england

563
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,559
rookies have got this like completely

564
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,000
covered for the next couple of days

565
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,880
and it's going to be awesome

566
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,679
so i'm going to make mine really quick

567
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,360
because i like only have two minutes

568
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,600
left

569
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,160
[Laughter]

570
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,559
it's going to be quick anyway so i

571
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:47,760
probably did the most

572
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,600
cardinal thing sin of talking live demo

573
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,640
um yeah uh

574
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,200
my very first live demo was an absolute

575
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,120
train wreck and i vowed on that day that

576
00:17:59,120 --> 00:17:59,520
well

577
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,240
i would never do it ever again and i

578
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,559
should have actually stuck to it because

579
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,280
i went on to do another live demo

580
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,200
probably a few months later or or

581
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,840
years later and it worked really well i

582
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,360
could do it in like several talks and

583
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,039
that like went well so like

584
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,880
you know what i actually got this live

585
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,160
demo stuff

586
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,160
um and great uh so

587
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,600
come up for uh uh habitat this year and

588
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,960
like i've got this live demo stuff down

589
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,960
to your tea i'm sorted i'm gonna do a

590
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,200
really good job

591
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,520
yeah i didn't take into account that i

592
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,640
would be presenting

593
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,160
on a screen behind me and it was

594
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,400
uh what's the assumption that you know

595
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,760
the wi-fi will just

596
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,240
do whatever you need and there will be

597
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,200
phone signal

598
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,960
and yeah my word of ask

599
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,799
if you're doing a live demo record it

600
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,039
and don't assume because i love them

601
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,039
it's gone rap before it will go right

602
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,080
again it's just the demo gods

603
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,600
messing around with you and trying to

604
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,520
entass you but

605
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,440
here's the thing though um besides

606
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,039
newcastle on my track

607
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,000
um there was one guy that did like 37

608
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,880
demos

609
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,080
like it was 37 little mini demos

610
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,520
live every single one of them worked

611
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,799
perfectly i was i was sweating buckets

612
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,720
the entire thing going

613
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,760
i i i don't like doing live demos on

614
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,799
local stuff

615
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,160
because like my handles slip i'll put an

616
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:32,720
extra

617
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,520
like even the keyboard like i'll type

618
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,200
totally differently

619
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,160
