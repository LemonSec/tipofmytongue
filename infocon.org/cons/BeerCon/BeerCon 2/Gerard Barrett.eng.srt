scott

22
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,120
um so my talk is entitled the impact of

23
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,879
data breaches to insurance front

24
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,840
just drawn back on my own past history

25
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,239
and

26
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,399
got my twitter handle there as well i

27
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,600
was inspired

28
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,559
for the talk um having started to nosey

29
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,399
around and infosec twitter

30
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,480
and seeing all the people complaining a

31
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,399
lot about data breaches but

32
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,400
all the talks never really went any

33
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,600
further than ah

34
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,960
gar you know evil data breaches um

35
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,200
but i got to see in my previous role i

36
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,040
am quite a lot of the things that kind

37
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,479
of happened to victims

38
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,560
and people where the data breaches

39
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,759
actually were applied

40
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,680
by criminals so i'm going to give you a

41
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,040
bit of an insight into that kind of

42
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,920
thing so we can

43
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,280
learn a bit from it together

44
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,720
um so who am i i was actually a

45
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,799
chemistry student um didn't

46
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,040
stumble in or graduating anything to do

47
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,720
with financial crime or fraud or

48
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,000
criminology or anything like that

49
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,680
i did a chemistry degree quite a few

50
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,280
years ago and finished up moved to the

51
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,159
uk

52
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,560
couldn't find work um because i managed

53
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,240
to plan it in 2008 when

54
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,280
everything went put in the world and

55
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,520
so ended up working customer services

56
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,360
insurance

57
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,479
large insurance company and moved around

58
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,159
there in within the same company and

59
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,040
eventually landed

60
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,439
in financial crime and investigating

61
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,560
application front

62
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,560
so not the crashing cars together but

63
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,920
more of the applications that are being

64
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,719
put in

65
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,520
um i do have a disclaimer i need to

66
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,000
start before

67
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,160
i go too much further please don't do

68
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,599
this at home or at work

69
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,680
or anywhere else for that matter i i

70
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,879
wasn't brave enough to put my

71
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,800
collaborates a little video in of

72
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,360
don't uh into this slide because i knew

73
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,200
i'd break my

74
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,000
my slides but please you know learn from

75
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,480
this

76
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,799
but learn it in order to save people and

77
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,480
so a couple of terms are going to throw

78
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,720
out um things like policies

79
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,360
brokers ncd a lot of you will drive

80
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,720
already some of you won't

81
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,480
i'm quite happy to answer any questions

82
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,000
you've got afterwards if i'm throwing

83
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,840
out a term that i haven't listed here

84
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,760
and no claims discount is one that we

85
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,440
see a lot of fraud on uh

86
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,599
because it's someone trying to obtain a

87
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,040
discount they're not entitled to

88
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,280
by falsifying documents if you drive a

89
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,360
car and you run a full gear without

90
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,560
actually running into anyone

91
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,319
and then they'll give you a discount for

92
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,440
the following year you can take to

93
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,400
another company

94
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,239
and a lot of people like to frequently

95
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,080
apply those and send them in and i think

96
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,840
one of the best ones i've seen is where

97
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,159
we looked at it opened up a document and

98
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,920
folded it out going the number of years

99
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,440
looks a little bit strange

100
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,360
and everyone laughed as we saw the

101
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,120
little bit of paper fall off the number

102
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,760
of years

103
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,080
because someone had just written down

104
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,840
the number of years on the document

105
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,920
glued it onto the page and sent it into

106
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,680
us hoping that we wouldn't notice but

107
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,360
they put it on the fold so

108
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,599
it just started to take itself off at

109
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,400
that point

110
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,840
um but that was a you do get to see some

111
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,760
rather interesting ones going around

112
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,599
and the abi a lot of the british

113
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,440
insurance all the immersion showers will

114
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,239
report into them um action fraud where

115
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,680
if you

116
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,519
say you've been a victim of fraud the to

117
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,280
the police the police will direct you on

118
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,599
for all to make the report and i also

119
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,840
reference cyphus as well who are uh

120
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,440
for prevention service in the united

121
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,760
kingdom and they do a lot of work

122
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,000
in putting a lot of information out

123
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,680
there to help victims of fraud as well

124
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,080
and that into the effect

125
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,239
um but to give you an idea what used

126
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,760
happened before data breaches

127
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,920
um because i managed to start financial

128
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,959
credit before

129
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,239
we started to see all these data

130
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,760
breaches going out we had the likes of

131
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,040
false rule addresses so

132
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,959
i'll use the uk as my examples because

133
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,280
that's where my experience is

134
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,040
for insurance where you live is very

135
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,320
important um

136
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,000
so a lot of the fraudsters in order to

137
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,519
make sure the prices were quite cheap

138
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,120
for an insurance policy

139
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,800
and would pick rural addresses so the

140
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,160
likes of aberdeen

141
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,880
inverness cornwall exeter i think the

142
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,880
worst i ever saw a house hit was

143
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,560
about 130 insurance policies taken out

144
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,560
at the one house in aberdeen

145
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,720
um which i felt rather sorry for the

146
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,240
person living there but unfortunately we

147
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,240
weren't able to put a stop for it

148
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,160
um but the reason they like to make sure

149
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,080
that the prices are really cheap for the

150
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,520
insurance is because

151
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,280
you see the sec point down is payment

152
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,120
fraud they're using stolen bank details

153
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,560
to actually put

154
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,680
the deposits in so if you're using a

155
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,800
stolen card you want it

156
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,560
to not hit any triggers of the banks so

157
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,919
you want to keep the payments as low as

158
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,520
possible coming out of it

159
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,280
and you also want to get more mileage

160
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,680
out of the cards so it will continue to

161
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,759
to be used as much as possible which

162
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,759
made sense for them to then target

163
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,400
the cheaper areas of the uk obviously to

164
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,759
keep things cheap

165
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,039
wouldn't tell anyone anything about

166
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,199
claims or convictions at all and you

167
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:17,600
know

168
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,039
i already told you you see a lot of

169
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,639
faults in the claims discounts

170
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,320
coming in or povs some people like to

171
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,840
call them as a proof of bonus

172
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,639
um but the main culprits for a lot of

173
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:29,039
the

174
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,360
organized fraud that we would see are

175
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,720
people called ghost brokers

176
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,919
you see the definition that the

177
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,520
insurance fraud bureau has thrown out

178
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,000
there

179
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,280
um defrosters few sellers sell drivers

180
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:39,680
cheap

181
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,400
apparently cheap motor insurance deals

182
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,759
but issue policies that aren't worth the

183
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,440
people around that is that is about as

184
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:45,840
spot

185
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,840
on as you can actually get with them and

186
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,880
they will go about

187
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,039
and buy their policies from a company

188
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,080
using false information

189
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,000
and before the likes of the data

190
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,759
breaches they would then docked into the

191
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,039
documents and hand them out to people

192
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:57,600
who

193
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,039
would see their names on the documents

194
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,720
and think oh everything's absolutely

195
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,520
fine

196
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,479
um with it i'm moving on but with the

197
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,120
oven the

198
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,800
bridges they they changed their their

199
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,199
act up a little bit and

200
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,720
the thing is why would someone actually

201
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,639
go and use one of these ghost brokers

202
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,840
it's not going to find them on the high

203
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,039
street you're not going to find them on

204
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,960
the normal websites at all

205
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,199
the reason comes down to pure costs and

206
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,479
a lot of people who are targeted are

207
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,360
young people

208
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,360
so you can see there the average cost of

209
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,600
car insurance for someone aged 20 to 24

210
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,960
so may have been driving for a couple

211
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,440
years

212
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,600
you're looking at over 900 pounds a year

213
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,199
for them and then if they're even a

214
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,880
slight bit younger someone coming into

215
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,039
their first car confuse.com reported

216
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,160
last year

217
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,000
that you were looking at nearly 2 000

218
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,080
pounds for someone who's 18 years old

219
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,720
to drive a car so that's that's going to

220
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,759
put them in quite a

221
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,400
you know a bit of a pickle how many 18

222
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,520
year olds are going to have that kind of

223
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,280
money to be able to pass out they may

224
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:49,520
have

225
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,800
spent all their money trying to get the

226
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,800
car that they wanted and they're going

227
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,039
to

228
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,599
really find a struggle to get the money

229
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:56,080
um

230
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,520
but the ghostbusters also target

231
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,360
vulnerable people so they'll turn

232
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,280
they'll be targeting the people who

233
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,880
may have moved to the country recently

234
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,160
where english won't be their first

235
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,639
language

236
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,120
so their reliance on contacts already

237
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,840
there

238
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,319
so you can we you see a lot of it in

239
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,520
communities

240
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,199
where people there was a lot of a

241
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,039
tight-knit community where someone was

242
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,000
held up as an

243
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,680
example of this is the person this is

244
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,039
the go-to person you want to get this

245
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,759
sorted

246
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,120
but what was actually happening is that

247
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,120
person was taking advantage of all these

248
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,599
these others and the the polish

249
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,919
community the north african community

250
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,280
people where they just didn't understand

251
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,639
the documents that were being shared in

252
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:31,520
front of them

253
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,360
but they were reliant on a community

254
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,759
member to support them and unfortunately

255
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,440
the wrong community member on occasion

256
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,120
would be the broker who's setting up

257
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,319
these policies

258
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,880
um they do obviously you know these

259
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,479
people are organized criminals

260
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,160
and so they do like to advertise

261
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,840
themselves they

262
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,840
got a couple of examples for you if just

263
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,199
taking quickly from

264
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,759
instagram and you can see what they're

265
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,360
looking for to lure people in

266
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,000
needing car insurance convicted driver's

267
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,120
insurance

268
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,960
and so people you are certainly get

269
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,400
insurance because maybe they've got a

270
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,000
drink driving conviction

271
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,160
um young drivers 17 plus and up to 50

272
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,840
not really sure what they're offering up

273
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,319
to 50 off but maybe you go to them with

274
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,120
a call

275
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,840
and they then go and try and get up to

276
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,479
50

277
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:17,919
down off as you can see in the last

278
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,560
example and those hashtags are

279
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,479
can lead you down a bit of a rabbit hole

280
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:23,599
if you start looking at them on

281
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,120
instagram by the way if you see all

282
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,759
these

283
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,440
all these dodgy people offering

284
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,039
insurance um

285
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,199
which lures people in uh logistics

286
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,799
insurance and cheap insurance are

287
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,240
two ones of well why are you using

288
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,519
instagram to go and find your car

289
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,360
insurance but you can find

290
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,799
quite a lot um on those and it can be

291
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,559
quite interesting to to track the people

292
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,679
you're tracking when you see them and

293
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,519
the policies coming into the business

294
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,279
you can then trace them back to seeing

295
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,880
the screenshots these people are sharing

296
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,560
of i've just paid for this policy for a

297
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,760
customer

298
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,880
um but given any other kind of numbers

299
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,920
we're not talking

300
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,120
small isolated cases and there was

301
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,399
nearly three quarters of a million

302
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,920
application fronts reported

303
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,760
to the association of british insurers

304
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,959
in 2019

305
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,680
now that can be anything from i believe

306
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,000
left

307
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,279
off a conviction that i've had in the

308
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,440
last five years be it going through me

309
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,320
of speeding

310
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,240
or you know being caught on my mobile

311
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,560
phone to living off claims

312
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,839
to be connected to organized crime being

313
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,000
post-brokering and having a faulty

314
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,279
policy set up

315
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,080
and but action fraud then are reporting

316
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,000
the year before the average cost

317
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,440
to a victim of ghost broker is you know

318
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,959
760

319
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:34,800
769 pounds so that's a victim handing

320
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,200
over

321
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,839
that kind of money on each case of it of

322
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:38,959
a ghost broker

323
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,200
um policy on average and sometimes they

324
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,000
could be more

325
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,839
because the vulnerable people you get

326
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,760
taken advantage of quite a lot i still

327
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,519
remember speaking to someone once

328
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,360
and they'd ended up handing over 1200

329
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,279
pounds because every time they wanted

330
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,800
the broker to correct the information of

331
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,279
the document they charged her 200 pounds

332
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,120
um to make a change through and people

333
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,320
do like to complain about

334
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,399
admin fees and insurance company being

335
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,160
20 or 30 pounds but

336
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,240
these people were charging fairly

337
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,760
serious amounts of cash to

338
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,800
to make their changes

339
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,760
but the government gave us a trial run

340
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,519
to dealing with people for identity

341
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:13,920
theft

342
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,320
because they freed the data one

343
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,360
company's house

344
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,200
so in june 2015 we started to see a rise

345
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,600
in identity fraud cases being passed

346
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,800
through us

347
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,279
from customer service and a lot of it k

348
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,360
actually came down to the fact that

349
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,360
this existed so there's a beta service

350
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,200
company's house any registered officer

351
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,680
in it

352
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,079
on a company you can now get their name

353
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,440
most of their date of birth

354
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,240
and their address which is great from a

355
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,519
fraud point of view that you can just

356
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,279
start impersonating people

357
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,200
and we started to see things ramp up

358
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,440
from there which um

359
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,680
give us a bit of a a taster of what was

360
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,640
actually to come

361
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,959
from a volume point of view and because

362
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,160
the fraudsters still have to go in and

363
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,600
pull that information off a

364
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,800
company's house but then we started to

365
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,000
see all the data breaches

366
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,279
coming through and all the information

367
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,040
getting shared like we've heard of all

368
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,560
the big ones the echo facts

369
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,320
talk talk british airways obviously

370
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,480
quite a giant one mom's net

371
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,760
flag facebook server because that was

372
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,600
one that when i was having a lot of

373
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,320
research

374
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,920
through i hadn't actually heard about

375
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,200
that particular one but it turned out

376
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,440
facebook had left an unprotected server

377
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,839
uh with no password on it and 18 million

378
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,040
british people's

379
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,279
information was left on the server and

380
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,640
you know how much people

381
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,200
tend to over share on facebook so

382
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,120
chances are there was a whole lot of

383
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,240
information that was uh

384
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,240
thrown up on there um which as a result

385
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,640
you know all that information went into

386
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,000
the ether a criminal

387
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,399
gets into the system and steals

388
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,200
everyone's personal information

389
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,680
they don't have the technology and the

390
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,959
the infrastructure

391
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,320
to actually deal and go any further with

392
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,680
the information they've stolen other

393
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,200
than to sell it on to other criminals

394
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,839
which is what

395
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,000
exactly what they do you then put that

396
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,880
into purpose

397
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,600
um being used for identity theft and all

398
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,399
sorts of

399
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,920
you know things can be applied for

400
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,160
mortgages mobile phones

401
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,279
my experiences and motor insurance

402
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,440
and so that will help delve into my

403
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,040
example keep my examples there but

404
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,120
it can be used for a multitude of of

405
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,079
reasons

406
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,120
um but the idea is well how much is

407
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,040
these payment details actually worth

408
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,120
so there was a study done a couple of

409
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,320
years ago and these are the up to date

410
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,120
figures

411
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,120
that privacy affairs have shared um

412
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,720
they did the work with cyphus back in

413
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,320
2018 to release a report

414
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,320
called rules at the end of the internet

415
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,079
which is definitely worth the read

416
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,440
um after beer con and having a look but

417
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,120
privacy affairs kept going with the

418
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,360
updates for the dark web price index

419
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,880
and those are the most recent figures

420
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,399
they have so you've got the likes of

421
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,000
mastercards and visas and american

422
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,200
expresses so you can buy

423
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,279
and you're not actually paying that much

424
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,120
for them and the one in the end is

425
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,480
probably one that you wouldn't have

426
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,399
come across as a term and that's a false

427
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,399
so that's someone's full identity

428
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,920
so they're saying that for forty two

429
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,440
dollars you can buy someone's complete

430
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,760
another identity and impersonate them

431
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,160
um which you know in the grand scheme of

432
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,760
things doesn't exactly put a whole lot

433
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,519
of value on someone

434
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,560
um so after the data breaches

435
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,160
we found that they were starting to

436
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,959
target local areas because

437
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,399
the ghost brokers who were setting up

438
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,839
these policies these organized people

439
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,680
were fighting a lot of complaints

440
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,760
from the folk that we're setting up

441
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,440
insurances for if you pretend to live in

442
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,160
aberdeen but you're

443
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,240
living in the likes of london the police

444
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,519
cottoned on quite quickly

445
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,760
to the fact that well if this car is

446
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,360
registered in aberdeen and i pull this

447
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,959
guy over because he's driving around the

448
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,399
northland and i'm going to have a little

449
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,279
chat

450
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,720
and and they hand over the driving

451
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,480
license the driving license is also in

452
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,279
north london

453
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,399
they're going to ask a lot more

454
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,399
questions whereas now they were offering

455
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,519
a service where

456
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,160
they were impersonating a local person

457
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:46,959
and

458
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,959
um having the having the person driving

459
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,120
around um using a stolen identity as the

460
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,800
policy ultrasound

461
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,959
this person is responsible for this and

462
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,639
again they kept with the same

463
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,320
the attacks they're still using paint

464
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,839
stolen payment details to

465
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,560
to pay for it and no information on

466
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,000
claims or convictions history for the

467
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,760
people who were driving in the cars

468
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,839
and there was a slight change with with

469
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,120
the false documents getting through

470
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,720
definitely noticed that there was a lot

471
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,519
more um utility bills and the like

472
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,920
were being provided through as as false

473
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,760
documentation from people who are

474
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,680
who are sending things into ourselves um

475
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,600
but to give you a proper visual of of

476
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,519
how it works and work in the example of

477
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,560
this kind of thing

478
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,240
so you get the likes of someone who's

479
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,600
recently moved to the country

480
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,920
and looking for mark just bought a car

481
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,360
alan he's young

482
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,199
he's needs some insurance to get himself

483
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,880

484
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,560

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,839
everyone says this is this is the

486
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,199

for your insurance um so he goes to sean

488
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,120
and sean from the national beer farmers

489
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,600

490
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,120
gives him price of two thousand pounds

491
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,199

492
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,360

gets his insurance for three four

530
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,480
hundred pounds hands it over as a bank

531
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,079
transfer or even

532
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,720
in one case of affirmative met someone

533
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,720
in a railway car park and handed over

534
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,519
cash

535
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,240
and gets himself his documentation uh

536
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,519
mike's names on it but

537
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,360
alan doesn't mind because he's already

538
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,440
been told mike's mike's fully aware

539
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,240
it's absolutely fine um so that michael

540
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,079
sort anything out if there's been any

541
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,680
problems with the insurance

542
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,720
um but same this you know

543
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,480
has its like problems when you're

544
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,839
targeting local people

545
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,560
um alan gets into bother and he gets the

546
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,199
wrong

547
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,800
police officer who pulls him over and

548
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,160
goes you know what there's something not

549
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,040
quite right here

550
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,959
and in one case we actually had a police

551
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,480
officer phone us the morning after a

552
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,360
stop

553
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,399
where the in this example alan was taken

554
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:49,600
to mike's house

555
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,680
and left in the back of the car and

556
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,279
they've chapped the door of mike's house

557
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,720
and said mike

558
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,079
do you know this chap in the back of the

559
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,160
car to which mike obviously has

560
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,000
absolutely no idea because scoot has

561
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,440
bought mike's details off one of the

562
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,639
data breaches

563
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,520
and says no no i don't know this guy at

564
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,000
all

565
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,240
and that's how alan was was nicked for

566
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,319
impersonating someone as well as

567
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,319
the insurance fraud for the the false

568
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,919
information that was used

569
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,160
um now you do get the odd person who

570
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,079
does know that you know what i'm going

571
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,359
to look this gift i'm not going to look

572
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,880
this gift or something

573
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,760
there's something quite wrong um but i

574
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,439
won't ask any questions in that way i

575
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:26,319
can't lie

576
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,679
when i go through the details because we

577
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,600
did have someone once who

578
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,760
a month after we his insurance was

579
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,760
stopped for

580
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,520
be appearing on a policy where the

581
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,200
identity was stolen

582
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,360
insured themselves and their own name

583
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,120
sorted out themselves obviously

584
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,720
knew there was something dodgy but

585
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,400
decided right i'll go my own way but

586
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,000
when challenged on it the fact that well

587
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,919
actually your car and your name and your

588
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,440
details appeared

589
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,280
under under mike's insurance and mike's

590
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,039
already phoned in to say

591
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,520
he has no idea about this his identity's

592
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,400
been stolen

593
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,720
then tried to claim that they had no

594
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,000
idea how that possibly could have

595
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,760
happened because they'd never seen the

596
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,080
car

597
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,480
until the week before and that they'd

598
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,240
taken out our policy never mind the

599
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:06,640
month

600
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,880
before but when obviously pushed we're

601
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,160
kind of going well they had your name

602
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,200
your date of birth and

603
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,640
it's the car you're currently after

604
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,559
buying so the chances of that

605
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,480
actually happening are slim to

606
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,760
absolutely none

607
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,640
and but people will still chance it and

608
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,559
see what they can talk their way out of

609
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,880
um which is unfortunate but in a lot of

610
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,400
these cases it's

611
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,559
allen is also a victim as well someone

612
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,559
who's been he's been conned over

613
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,200
um so you do have quite a bit of falling

614
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,799
allen's obviously paid over

615
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,720
fake insurance he's also handed over his

616
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,120
personal information to a broker who's

617
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,440
now being paid and has gotten a new

618
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,679
identity he can use at a later date

619
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,320
to forgively impersonate alan and if the

620
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,280
insurance gets

621
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,840
stopped down all the contact details are

622
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,360
wrong on the insurance policy so

623
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,640
he could be hit with a fine of a

624
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,320
thousand pounds his car could be taken

625
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:54,720
off

626
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,919
and end up with six points in his

627
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,400
license which in the uk for the first

628
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,000
two years that could be your license

629
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,640
gone

630
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,200
and then having to reset your your your

631
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,160
test again

632
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,160
and so it could be quite problematic for

633
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,600
for young people and vulnerable people

634
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,240
who've

635
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,000
only just recently got their licenses as

636
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,760
well mike's obviously got the problem

637
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,600
but he's got unsolicited mail which

638
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,120
doesn't sound

639
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,280
that bad of uh it's just spam mail

640
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,480
coming through

641
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,840
but a lot of insurance companies

642
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,679
nowadays what they do is they don't

643
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:22,960
actually write down anymore

644
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,880
they do a lot of it online so the first

645
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,559
time that mike can find out that his

646
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,000
identity has been stolen

647
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,520
is actually when the police writes him

648
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,280
to say that alan's been speeding in his

649
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,080
car

650
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,400
and the penalty notices get sent to the

651
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,679
address that the

652
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,799
the insurance is set to um which is

653
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,720
obviously problematic and disturbing for

654
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,480
anyone as well obviously given the

655
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,799
confirmation as identity's been stolen

656
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,880
but if the policies aren't picked up

657
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,559
because sometimes they're not

658
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,480
um and they can get through the process

659
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,240
and set them up in a way that it doesn't

660
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:52,640
look

661
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,000
because if they've stolen all likes

662
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,760
details and everything matches

663
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,240
on the automated checks then you'll end

664
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,720
up with a case of

665
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,080
that might could find that that policy

666
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,240
is actually run for

667
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,480
a month or two months and the bank

668
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,400
details don't work anymore so then mike

669
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,400
actually then gets chased for the debts

670
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,360
that he's got

671
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,600
on his on the policy that he do nothing

672
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,720
about um

673
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,240
and that could be a rather upsetting one

674
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,840
where you get a bill in for from a

675
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,880
company that you've

676
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,840
possibly never heard of as well as um

677
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,440
for a policy you never to get the first

678
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,679
books

679
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,280
but that's only small fish this

680
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,600
that's only a site like for a lot of

681
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,200
these schools brokers who are setting up

682
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,080
policies

683
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,600
a lot of them well all of them are

684
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,440
criminals um but they will

685
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,159
all have links back to organized crime

686
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:42,799
um

687
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,360
and they're saying quite a lot of

688
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,120
activity goes on with regard to it

689
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,480
because

690
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,919
criminal gangs don't want their cars

691
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,360
being pulled over you know they want to

692
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,159
be able to travel

693
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,159
with ease without anyone bothering them

694
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,400
or asking them any pesky questions like

695
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,840
where do these people in the back of

696
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,919
your car come from why is there a back

697
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,280
of tools in the booth of the car and

698
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,799
you can see there's two the top two

699
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,159
points are transporting people and

700
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,600
people trafficking

701
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,200
there is a difference between the two

702
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,280
because the organized crime groups want

703
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,559
to be transporting

704
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,440
their staff we'll see around the around

705
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,720
the uk

706
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,760
um we know um from

707
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,159
law enforcement that they actually can

708
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,000
fly people that some organized groups

709
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,159
will fly people into the country

710
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,280
put them up in a hotel then have them

711
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,679
commit burglary or other crimes and then

712
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,360
fly them back out again

713
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,080
um the following day which makes it

714
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,840
quite difficult for them to actually

715
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,120
track these people down

716
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,799
i had a rather interesting case once

717
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,400
where someone whose

718
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,000
bank details have been used as well as

719
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,600
their identity they've been stolen

720
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,080
and we had a chat and they gave me the

721
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,919
the details so it could go phone their

722
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,520
bank to see if we could line up any

723
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,480
information

724
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,640
and kind of work together with regards

725
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,840
to like sharing

726
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,520
and which is what a lot of companies do

727
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,280
try and do and

728
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,640
the president of the bank started

729
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,720
laughing because the bank card that had

730
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,240
been used to set up the insurance policy

731
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,039
with ourselves

732
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,799
was also used to book a flight um from

733
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,679
the uk back to eastern europe and it

734
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:12,000
turned

735
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,919
out that as i was on the phone the

736
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,360
flight was due to land

737
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,559
um and gave him a little bit of a

738
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,240
chuckle when he was thinking about just

739
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,000
that one card was just absolutely hammer

740
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,120
there was takeaways on it they booked a

741
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,640
you hotel it's done all sorts with

742
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,320
regard to the details just almost keep

743
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,600
it as a single

744
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,400
enclosed case for it and but you can

745
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,480
only guess to what the person who was

746
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,760
flying back had actually been

747
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,919
transported over to the uk to actually

748
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:38,640
do

749
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,880
um with regards to people trafficking as

750
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,320
well it's it's quite ominous when you

751
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,600
get a phone call from the police and

752
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,360
it's it's from people trafficking and

753
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,200
child's exploitation because

754
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,120
they want to move people around an area

755
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,440
where the car show is insured

756
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,720
well when you're a criminal you're not

757
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,000
really going to use your own money to

758
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,280
pay for anything so you'll

759
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,960
you'll have someone else pay for it even

760
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,640
if they don't know they're doing it

761
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,760
um but in the uk as well there's

762
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,480
quite a big problem with the the drug

763
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,080
gangs in the large cities

764
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,960
moving drugs into the rural areas and as

765
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,400
you heard me say when the data breaches

766
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,240
came in they started the target local

767
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:12,960
areas

768
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,000
for their for the insurance policies

769
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
and what we actually found having spoken

770
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,679
to the police in

771
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,760
the kind of devon cornwall area was that

772
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,919
they were insuring the cars down there

773
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,200
to show us there but what they were

774
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,960
doing the car was doing was going to and

775
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,320
from that area and

776
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,159
london doing the transportation of the

777
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,840
drugs and moving them around the country

778
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,720
that way

779
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,600
um which is a quite a quite a way i did

780
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,720
get a call once where

781
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,559
someone says that car and you've got on

782
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,559
cover and think yeah yeah we've got that

783
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:41,120
we're just

784
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,720
about to get it off covering it's like i

785
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,159
wouldn't worry about it driving anywhere

786
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,919
we raided the house yesterday in london

787
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:47,360
and it's up on bricks

788
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,720
um and the front garden outside um which

789
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,000
was nice to know the car wouldn't be

790
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,520
involved in any accidents because that's

791
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,640
that's the last thing you want to hear

792
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,840
when you're when you're dealing with

793
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,159
these

794
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,320
someone's been hurt um that they've been

795
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,600
involved in an accident but it was nice

796
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,720
to know that the cars

797
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,120
was up on up on bricks

798
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,679
the thing is how can we help and the

799
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,039
insurance for our bureau

800
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,320
um run achieve link um

801
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,080
so you can if you've any concerns that

802
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,120
someone's committing any kind of

803
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,400
insurance from the uk

804
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,159
you can actually report it to them and

805
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:19,760
they take all that information and share

806
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,880
around the insurers

807
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,600
just in case something then tweaks for

808
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,880
someone that they can actually

809
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,799
have another human eye take a look over

810
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,559
and go right that you know that that's

811
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,000
worth another question

812
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
and and go through doesn't always lead

813
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,080
to anything but it's certainly worth

814
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,880
helping people because it will save save

815
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,720
everyone money in the long run

816
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,279
um but also tell two this is the whole

817
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:41,840
idea

818
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,360
you can see our two it's normally a

819
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,880
teacup when you're talking about tell

820
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,080
kelty the social media

821
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,400
campaign you know tell two over brew i

822
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,400
think it being the beer farmers and beer

823
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:50,880
con

824
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,279
it needs to be the the two fights tell

825
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,000
two friends

826
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,240
share the stories with them and let them

827
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,360
know um

828
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,400
how they can keep themselves uh wise

829
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,960
to any of the scams especially young

830
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,080
family members

831
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,919
um who might be starting or if you come

832
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,440
across someone who's just recently moved

833
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,480
to the uk

834
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,760
um and then moving on from um and just

835

you know keeping friends and family safe

836

as much as you can and

837
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,200
i've told several of you if you go and

838
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,039
tell two people each if we cut a few

839
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,480
lines out of the pyramid the idea is

840
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:20,880
that

841
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,360
one person tilts two and so on and that

842
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,080
person tells

843
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,080
two more and everyone tells two by 26 27

844
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,559
people don't we will be well in line to

845
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:31,840
tell everyone in the country

846
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,360
and how to keep an eye out for all these

847
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,039
scams that are out there

848
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,080
um so that brings me the end

849
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,679
i want to say thanks to the beer farmers

850
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,600
for letting me help out let me speak

851
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,080
and the mentors have been absolutely

852
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:44,960
incredible

853
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,440
over the last four to five weeks and the

854
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,760
amount of time they have actually spent

855
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,000
um mentoring everyone and spending the

856
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,679
time and the fellow speakers as well

857
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,120

858
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,919
and we're all rookie speakers and to do

859
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,520

860
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,559
hung out and um had an absolute laugh um

861
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,120
getting everything ready for it all um

862
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:05,600

866
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,480

well listen thanks very much for that i

868
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,400
know uh

869
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,400
we we kind of met through your previous

870
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,919
um employment let's just leave it at

871
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,919
that i guess um i wasn't

872
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,640
sc insurance just want to point that out

873
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,919
and that's not how

874
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,559
but um no i i i thought it was really

875
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:35,200
good we

876
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,120
often get siloed it's kind of like

877
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,799
talking to james earlier

878
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:42,000
um you get siloed and you you look at

879
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,600
date breach or you look at a

880
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,279
hack or wannacry and you don't think

881
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,520
about you know

882
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,640
the people on the ground that are

883
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,120
actually seeing this stuff live

884
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,679
in person going i can literally track a

885
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,360
piece of data from here

886
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,720
and see how it's been used and it almost

887
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,880
has a blast radius it's not just one

888
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,080
victim it's like

889
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,880
five four or five victims around that um

890
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,880
have had a couple of questions in

891
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,520
um i'm gonna do just had a couple more

892
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,279
questions come flying in

893
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:15,279
uh first one is from sp coulson

894
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,720
uh who asked due to due to gdpr

895
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,120
uh we no longer have who has records on

896
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,080
domain names

897
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,200
um how has this impacted research and

898
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,679
incident analysis into fraud markets

899
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,000
if at all i don't have an answer for

900
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,200
that to be perfectly honest

901
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,960
and a lot of my previous role was i

902
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,480
essentially found the particular

903
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,520
policies um a lot of people

904
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,440
because i suppose what i was saying

905
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,919
about the vulnerable being targeted

906
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,000
and these ghost workers are being are

907
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,440
quite organized and doing everything a

908
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,240
lot through

909
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,320
through instagram and like and they

910
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,279
actually

911
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,320
kind of what's the best term for it they

912
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:54,880
um

913
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,279
they put the fear of god into the people

914
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,720
who buy policies from them

915
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,440
um you're going to trust if you've just

916
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,240
moved

917
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,720
to here see and you've been introduced

918
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,520
to someone

919
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,760
as a pillar of the community to be told

920
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,440
this is the person you go to to sort of

921
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,720
your problems

922
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,080
if i then phone you and say there's a

923
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,760
problem or somehow i managed to get hold

924
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,039
of you and say there's a problem with

925
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,320
your insurance

926
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,000
the person who's bought it for you has

927
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,679
done something wrong

928
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,600
yeah i immediately get your back up and

929
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,200
you defend the person

930
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,640
who's screwed you over which is a bit

931
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,600
unfortunate

932
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,919
and can be very difficult to break down

933
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,039
um

934
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,279
we had you know on occasion but it can

935
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:36,080
be quite

936
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,840
quite rare to actually convince these

937
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,080
people that you know what no all these

938
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,000
problems you're having isn't because i'm

939
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,440
the insurance company cancelling your

940
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,279
insurance your problem is is that you've

941
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,919
paid 600 points to someone in a car park

942
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:50,000
and you really shouldn't have done that

943
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,039
um to get your your details through

944
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,000
um but yeah the who is the who is stuff

945
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,880
we

946
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,679
did rarely rarely came across um being

947
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:00,799
able to track down the particular

948
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,960
websites in that um with regard to

949
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,039
how my job was quite siloed in that

950
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,399
fashion um

951
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:07,440
so it wasn't something that we

952
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,440
particularly sold often hopefully that

953
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,799
kind of starts to answer the question

954
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,399
for you sure

955
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,000
there are a couple more questions in

956
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,600
slack um do hang out

957
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,240
but um yes i can pick them up in slack

958
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:18,880
anyway for

959
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,120
running short then anyway sure um if

960
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,799

963
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:26,960

964
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,399
um i just want to relay some of the

965
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,559

966
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:31,360

967
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,559

been sitting in the green room all day

976
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,799

977
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,399
going on you know what the audience size

978
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,240

979
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,799
that can be easy for you so again

980
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,240
