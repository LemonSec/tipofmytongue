1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,520
up next we have

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,520
the great vivian talking about what i

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,200
call spooky voodoo

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,360
which is malicious host recruitment over

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,639
ipv6 so

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,000
vivian welcome please take it away hi uh

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,480
so my name is viv and i'm a second year

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,279
phd student at the university of glasgow

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,760
so i don't have much of an infosec

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,039
background as yet

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,359
so this is my first foray enter my

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,880
background before this was in the

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,480
development of transport protocols so i

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,199
thought

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,120
okay why don't we take it one layer down

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,480
and see what we can do there

17
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,600
to design security risks so

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,520
there's a very common we'll start off

19
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,960
with something that is actually true

20
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,520
it is impossible to scan the entire ipv6

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,879
address space

22
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,000
ipv6 addresses are 128 bits long so that

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,719
is

24
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,719
this many hosts if someone wants to tell

25
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:51,920
me how to pronounce that number i'd be

26
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,039
really grateful because every

27
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,399
presentation i've done on this so far i

28
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,840
just point at the screen and go look

29
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,680
space so

30
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,120
that means it's more secure right you

31
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,079
know there's no way you're going to just

32
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,760
randomly guess one of these

33
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,959
billions and billions and billions of

34
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,799
addresses

35
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,600
not exactly we can't perform ipv6 scans

36
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,159
so first of all let's find out what ipv6

37
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,439
address actually looks like what we're

38
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,400
looking for

39
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,680
so usually they're big old horrible

40
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,720
scary looking things like this

41
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,799
and they can be divided into two halves

42
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,720
the first half first 64 bits

43
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,439
is the network prefix so that means okay

44
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,040
on what network

45
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,360
does this device actually live uh if

46
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,280
we're contacting it through the internet

47
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,320
this is the address that you want to

48
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,600
look for the half of the address you

49
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,960
want to look for

50
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,960
the second 64 bits is the interface

51
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,040
identifier so that identifies okay that

52
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,920
is this host

53
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,439
on this particular network prefix

54
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,759
so there's absolutely no point in

55
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,360
knocking on a non-existent door so you

56
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,880
want to find network prefixes that

57
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,920
actually exist

58
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,360
and that makes your life a whole lot

59
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,040
easier instead of iterating through the

60
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,680
entire

61
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,719
ipv6 address space so

62
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,320
we need to find out where everyone lives

63
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,920
and we can do that using

64
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,759
bgp stream so bgp is border gateway

65
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:06,479
protocol

66
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,479
and these typically take a form of

67
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,840
advertisements that look like

68
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,000
this so this is like written information

69
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,400
so

70
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,200
what this is saying is this address is

71
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,319
accessible

72
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,319
we want people to be able to reach it

73
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,920
so what slash 48 on the end means

74
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,480
is the first 48 bits of this ipv6

75
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,800
address are already known they're fixed

76
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,920
you don't need to go in iterate through

77
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,400
all those what we do have

78
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,920
uh is so to find a live network prefix

79
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,480
um we still have 16 bits that we need to

80
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,599
look through

81
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,959
and that's a lot more feasible to look

82
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,200
through than all 64 bits that we would

83
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,560
have to do for an interface identifier

84
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,640
if we didn't have this advertisement

85
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,959
so the other 64 bits right on the end

86
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,800
the interface identifier

87
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,560
we don't know those yet but they're not

88
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,760
relevant to us right now for actually

89
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,280
finding a live network that might have

90
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,120
hosts on it so effectively

91
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,480
going back to our early analogy about

92
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,319
finding out where everyone lives

93
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,480
this is us trying to find out okay where

94
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,360
is a host

95
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,120
uh where is a house that we can look for

96
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,519
residents of

97
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,720
so two to the power of 16 we've got just

98
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,200
over

99
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,239
65 and a half thousand possible hosts

100
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,800
that could uh possible network prefixes

101
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,519
in this advertisement

102
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,000
so an attacker would just iterate

103
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,280
through those 16 bits

104
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,200
progressively starting from zero going

105
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,120
all the way up to fffffffff

106
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,519
say we're sending icmp v6 echo requests

107
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:34,319
so just

108
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,840
pinging them seeing if we get any

109
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,080
response whatsoever if the network does

110
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,879
not exist

111
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,879
at all it's not live or it's not

112
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,319
accessible for whatever reason it will

113
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,080
just come back with request type

114
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,200
okay not very interesting but say we

115
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,319
stumbled across this address at the

116
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,040
bottom

117
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,280
um four two zero zero

118
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,720
and it came back with a slightly

119
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,879
different response saying icmp v6

120
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,799
destination host unreachable

121
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,720
okay normally that's not interpreted as

122
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,080
being a good outcome it's unreachable

123
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,920
i've not got what i wanted

124
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,120
in this case it tells us that this

125
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,840
network prefix exists it is reachable

126
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,239
but we haven't uh managed to contact a

127
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,080
valid host on it yet

128
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,400
but this is good enough this means that

129
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,000
we've discovered 16

130
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,880
bits uh that make up the rest of our

131
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,399
network prefix

132
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,560
so we have effectively found a house so

133
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,520
we can start

134
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,320
finding who actually lives there which

135
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,560
devices are hosted on this network

136
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,240
and that's the remaining 64 bits that we

137
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,720
need to find a 64-bit host identifier

138
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,280
so maybe we should just ask a question

139
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,960
how many bits does it take to screw over

140
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,040
a smart light bulb

141
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,880
so say we have nervous energy light

142
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,880
bulbs it's got an over complicated buggy

143
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,560
ipv6 stack

144
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,639
and the oui is 10 0 0 20.

145
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,960
okay so one of the images has screwed up

146
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,320
on this apologies it is supposed to be a

147
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,680
light bulb not recyclable so

148
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,120
but you know we can get past that so

149
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,440
oui that's an organizationally unique

150
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,720
identifier

151
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,120
um so this is the first half of a mac

152
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,720
address and it will be associated with a

153
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,160
particular manufacturer of a network

154
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,520
interface card

155
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,280
so all of these are publicly available

156
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,960
information uh you can find this on the

157
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,680
ieee website it's not a secret

158
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,960
so that can be made into the first

159
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,240
first 24 bits of an ipv6 host identifier

160
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,000
on certain outdated ipv6

161
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,960
addressing schemes in order to pad out

162
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,680
the

163
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,479
uh so mac addresses are 48 bits in

164
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:30,880
length

165
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,000
in order to pad out uh this 64-bit

166
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,560
host identifier you need to add the

167
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,120
constant

168
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,919
f f e that should be in the middle

169
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,199
so all that we've got left that we need

170
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,520
to iterate through is an unknown 24 bits

171
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,960
at the end the second half of the mac

172
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,440
address

173
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,360
which is individual to that specific

174
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,919
network identifi network interface card

175
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,240
the host

176
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,560
so what we need to do is flip bit seven

177
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,000
to the value of one

178
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,720
um to make sure that's uh i think it's

179
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,000
the universal bit that gets flipped

180
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,600
there but you need to do that to make

181
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,720
this into an ipd6 address

182
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,880
so all that we have left saturate

183
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,960
through is 24 bits at the end we figured

184
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,960
out what 104 bits of this address are

185
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,919
already with

186
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,680
entirely publicly available information

187
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,960
bgp records

188
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,440
and organizational unique identifiers

189
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,639
available through ieee

190
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,160
so the answer how many bits does it take

191
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,360
to screw over smart light bulb

192
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,080
potentially

193
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,600
is 24. so that is

194
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,440
just under 17 million possible hosts

195
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,039
that would have this oui on this network

196
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,479
so what we can do is iterate through

197
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,400
these 24 bits as we did before

198
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,440
when we're trying to find the active

199
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,800
network prefix and if we get an icmp v6

200
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,400
echo reply this time it means we've hit

201
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,520
on a valid host

202
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,039
we've found a device on this network

203
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,280
and that's the ipv6 address i presented

204
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,960
at start

205
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,199
so now that we've found our smart light

206
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,800
bulb what's actually next

207
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,120
what happens next we can do anything we

208
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,720
like we know where this

209
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,800
uh smart light bulb is and if we happen

210
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,000
to have an exploit that

211
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,759
works with this uh smart light bulb

212
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,599
we can exploit it do whatever we'd like

213
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,160
to uh and then potentially get

214
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,759
information about the rest of the

215
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,560
network so

216
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,720
we could call ipv6 uh ip

217
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,560
6 nay show to get the ipv6 addresses of

218
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,080
every single other device on this

219
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,960
network

220
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,400
and that's potentially valuable

221
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,919
information if it's a privacy address

222
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:32,880
that we would not have been able to

223
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,319
guess randomly it's just randomly

224
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,039
allocated

225
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,680
64 bits we'd have that information that

226
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,039
we've obtained to the weakest link in

227
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:39,759
the network

228
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,720
the smart light bulb

229
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,440
okay that's cool but why would anyone do

230
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,400
this instead of doing an ipv4 scan

231
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,639
so something that's interesting about

232
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,599
ipv6

233
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,120
is the addresses don't need to be

234
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,440
recycled um the entire reason we have

235
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,599
ipv6 is the ipv4 address space

236
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,240
is exhausted uh there's not enough

237
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,039
devices

238
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,479
uh there's not enough addresses for all

239
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,400
the devices that are internet connected

240
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,840
now so ipv4

241
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,280
i think we've got 4.3 billion ipv4

242
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,960
addresses and well in excess of that

243
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,440
number of

244
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,479
devices on the internet um

245
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,520
so what isps will usually do is

246
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,520
cycle your ipv4 address if you're not

247
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,720
using an address at that point they'll

248
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,919
assign it to someone else and this

249
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,440
happens very often

250
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,319
ipv6 does not have that requirement uh

251
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,599
there's more than enough addresses to go

252
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,000
around so why would you cycle it

253
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,120
so i think if there's address

254
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,880
persistence you could potentially build

255
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,399
up like some horrible little argos

256
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,559
catalogue of addresses about okay which

257
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,159
kind of device do you want to compromise

258
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,519
today you know we can give you access to

259
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,200
alexas we can give you access to smart

260
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,799
bulbs

261
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,279
all sorts of things um so you would only

262
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,560
have to perform these scans

263
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,320
very rarely if addresses they turn out

264
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,760
to be persistent

265
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,360
and that's potentially very high value

266
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,399
data you could sell for a lot of money

267
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,240
so going back to ben's talk earlier it's

268
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,519
really captured my imagination that

269
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,120
stuff about hacking smart toilets

270
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,880
so you could cause mass havoc and stuff

271
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,240
like smart cities

272
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,640
like say some ven uh the person in

273
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,320
charge of buying stuff for a smart city

274
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:06,959
was

275
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,720
bought into the hype that okay ipv6

276
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,200
addresses are 128 bits that

277
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,640
automatically means they're more secure

278
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,240
right

279
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,680
but they decided to go with that

280
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,440
insecure addressing scheme based on mac

281
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,480
addresses

282
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,320
you can have a lot of fun getting remote

283
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,000
access to traffic lights

284
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,440
cause an absolute mayhem of that you can

285
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,399
entirely deny an entire city access to

286
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,839
public toilets so if they had smart

287
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,440
toilets you could deny them access to

288
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,040
trains plot them all the stations just

289
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,080
the possibilities are endless

290
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,519
my personal favorite smart device i've

291
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,200
seen was this came up i think it was

292
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,080
about a year ago

293
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,040
um it was the smart candle that had like

294
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,480
a real flame and there was all these

295
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,760
insistences about like

296
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,440
oh no it's safe like we will still need

297
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,040
you to use bluetooth to

298
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,160
uh to light this but

299
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,080
they had plans to allow alexa and google

300
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,360
home to connect it

301
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,279
and light it from there so if you

302
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,800
managed to compromise one of these alexa

303
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,720
google home devices through its ipv6

304
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,120
address and a little horrible catalogue

305
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,959
you could quite easily start fires in

306
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,479
people's homes entirely remotely

307
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,720
there was also ipv6 ping of death there

308
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,160
was a cve that was going around like

309
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,920
literally about two weeks ago

310
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,560
if someone had access to windows hosts

311
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,600
um

312
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,680
you know here's a collection of ipv6

313
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,839
addresses but only two windows hosts

314
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,160
i could have sold a lot of money to the

315
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,680
right person wanted to exploit this

316
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,040
so why am i scanning ipv6 addresses

317
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,040
for safety i'm one of the best people to

318
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,560
find these ipv6 devices

319
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,680
uh so if our research team can find uh

320
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,720
devices using

321
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,040
scans built using entirely public

322
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,480
information

323
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,360
we can inform manufacturers uh about a

324
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,880
potential security fault before someone

325
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,640
does something very very nasty with this

326
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,640
so ways that you can build resistance to

327
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,720
ipv6 scans

328
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,000
randomize dhcp v6 if you select

329
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,160
an address a host identifier at random

330
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,079
you're back to a 64-bit address space

331
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,360
again

332
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,480
so that is that number there again

333
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,760
a lot of unpronounceable numbers in this

334
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,399
talk but it's a lot of possible hosts

335
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,160
either way if this is randomly selected

336
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,600
and there's no patterns

337
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,480
that we can exploit to scan there's not

338
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,680
much choice i'm going to find anything

339
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,800
not much chance i'm going to find

340
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,000
anything on your network

341
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,279
this is good privacy addresses

342
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,920
so most mainstream operating systems

343
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,519
will do this by default they'll assign a

344
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,600
privacy address which if this is done

345
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,640
using a secure

346
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,839
random number generator and

347
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,079
cryptographic algorithm it's impossible

348
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,120
to predict that

349
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,120
so again we're back to the 64-bit search

350
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,160
space

351
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,399
uh however if you assign an insecure mac

352
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,200
address based ipv6 address in addition

353
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,800
to this privacy address

354
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,399
we can still contact your device the

355
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,760
privacy address might obscure your

356
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,360
outgoing traffic but it will do nothing

357
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,880
to protect against your id

358
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,680
active ipd6 scans if it's assigned in

359
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,760
addition to this

360
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,680
so privacy addresses have the additional

361
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,519
benefit of whenever you power off your

362
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:02,000
machine

363
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,279
quite a lot of them will um assign a

364
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,639
completely new privacy address every

365
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:07,360
single time

366
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,279
you start up your network into face card

367
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,079
again this is good

368
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,920
prefix cycle so you remember the first

369
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,040
64 bits of an ipv6 address

370
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,160
where the network identifier

371
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,120
if you manage to cycle this every so

372
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,120
often so people can't keep a persistent

373
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,000
catalogue of ipv6 addresses that happen

374
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,639
to have a vulnerable device on it

375
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,680
you know this makes ipv6 scans a lot

376
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,480
more difficult

377
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,800
to it means that ipv6 scans would need

378
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,880
to be performed a lot more often

379
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,639
and people just would not want to invest

380
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:41,760
that amount of work if they were doing

381
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,440
anything malicious with it

382
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,639
so prefix cycling would do a lot to

383
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,120
disincentivize

384
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,800
uh the economic reasons to perform my

385
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,440
bb6 scans

386
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,560
so the next steps in this research

387
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,079
this has all been quite theoretical so

388
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,519
far what we've built up from past

389
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,560
research papers

390
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,240
internet standards documents other

391
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,160
things like that so what we want to do

392
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,200
is put it into practice

393
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,120
and see how many iot devices actually

394
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,279
have global ipv6 addresses

395
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,040
uh using they're the most likely to use

396
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,880
this insecure addressing scheme

397
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,560
and can we attempt to locate them using

398
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,480
an internet wide scan in the world like

399
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,000
does this actually work

400
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,639
um in practice as well as on paper so

401
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:21,440
we're currently writing up an

402
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,079
experimental plan for this

403
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,760
uh we also want to establish patterns

404
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,120
and address allocations

405
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,920
so for example domestic isps like the

406
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,839
last isp i was with allocated

407
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,120
um 56 ipv6 address ranges to their

408
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,560
customers

409
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,079
this is a very trivial search space so

410
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,920
if we were searching for a network

411
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,959
uh that was live we would have 256

412
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,800
possibilities to search per 56

413
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,480
advertisements that's trivial you can do

414
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,320
that in under a second

415
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,079
so what we also want to see is do

416
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,519
domestic isps i

417
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,360
allocate ipv6 address ranges to

418
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,560
customers sequentially

419
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,360
for example like this customer one get

420
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,639
slash 56 you know

421
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,240
one at the start of that and then the

422
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,079
second customer gets o2 and so on and so

423
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,600
on you know are there other patterns we

424
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,000
can exploit to make our life even easier

425
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,519
for these scans uh we also want to

426
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,920
actually you know clean up the mess

427
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,199
we've created like okay

428
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,600
we found all these devices that's cool

429
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,519
but what we need to do is responsibly

430
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,279
disclose these relevant findings to the

431
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,880
device manufacturers to

432
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,600
fix potential identified risks before

433
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,399
someone can actually

434
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,320
exploit it in practice ipv6 scanning

435
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,720
it's quite an is it's one of these

436
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,000
things that's not a risk at the moment

437
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,120
it's just too impact

438
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,720
uh it's not high risk at the moment you

439
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,399
know it's quite impractical you need a

440
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,320
lot of knowledge to pull off

441
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,320
but you know 10 20 30 years down the

442
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,079
line when we have even more devices on

443
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:42,800
the internet

444
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,360
um ipv6 adoption becomes even more

445
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,199
common this might become a big risk

446
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,800
so if we can start fixing that now when

447
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,560
we've still got several years to work on

448
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:50,880
it

449
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,920
this is good so the conclusion

450
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,839
ipd6 is a force for goods despite

451
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,519
everything that i've said to you

452
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,040
the only negative i would say is don't

453
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,040
assume that ipv6 is automatically more

454
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,519
secure

455
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,279
or that it's more uh or that it's

456
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,880
impossible to scan

457
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,000
however if you manage ipv6 well you'll

458
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,040
benefit from

459
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,480
end-to-end connectivity so you don't

460
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,920
need to start wrestling with nats or

461
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,199
address translation or anything like

462
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,000
that

463
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,760
and you'll also benefit from resistance

464
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,120
to scanning so

465
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,440
ipv4 scans absolutely trivial to do

466
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,720
if you exclusively use ipv6 addressing

467
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,440
uh and you do it well using uh cycle

468
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,240
prefixes

469
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,079
uh dhcp v6 privacy addresses if you use

470
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,600
all that well you will have a lot more

471
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,959
resistance to scanning than if you just

472
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,079
start with ipv4

473
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,399
or badly managed ipv6 it's worth looking

474
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,160
into

475
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,639
and that's it um so any questions would

476
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,360
be great and

477
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,720
i'd just like to say a big thanks to

478
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,320
everyone involved with this event and

479
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,680
huge thanks to the beer farmers for

480
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,279
giving me the space to speak

481
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,839
thank you

482
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,519
thank you so much um that was awesome um

483
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,880
i know

484
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,880
i know i give you a lot of hassle over

485
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,639
ipv6

486
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,160
spooky voodoo and all that it doesn't no

487
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:08,720
you're right

488
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,040
um that's genuinely the first time i've

489
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,560
i've listened to or

490
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,639
watched or heard some ipv6 stuff

491
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,360
and not been bored dramatically it's so

492
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,240
daunting

493
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,759
it's really approachable how you've

494
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,079
presented it even to an idiot like me

495
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,120
so thank you for that thank you um

496
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,800
there is a couple of questions from the

497
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,480
audience i'm just adding them to the

498
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,240
list just in case we don't have time

499
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,360
but um tim has asked uh take-up has been

500
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,839
slow when do you think ipv6 will start

501
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:38,639
to become

502
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,160
more common uh so we are seeing

503
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,839
increased uptake of it now so

504
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,160
uh what i would say is ipv6 it has been

505
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,000
around since you know the 90s this is

506
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,639
not a new

507
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,680
protocol by any means but we are seeing

508
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,079
i think the rise of sort of huge

509
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,600
companies like google and facebook and

510
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,360
all that sort of thing you know whatever

511
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,320
the politics we disagree with on that

512
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,759
they do tend to influence a lot of

513
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,279
trends and things so you know there's

514
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,559
like quick i don't know if anyone has

515
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,679
much experience with that

516
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,240
but uh quick it's a reasonably new

517
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,760
protocol but it's already seen huge

518
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,199
adoption from a lot of companies because

519
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,880
oh it's sponsored by google this must be

520
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,400
good

521
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,400
i think the fact that google and

522
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,839
facebook and akamai and all that sort of

523
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:18,400
thing are

524
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,160
taking up ipv6 and taking it quite

525
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,679
seriously i think it might inspire a lot

526
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:22,959
of other people to get onto as well

527
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,559
about oh this is a trendy thing

528
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,640
you should get onto it which is why i'm

529
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,000
a bit hesitant about people sort of

530
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,280
adopting this without knowing what

531
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,440
they're doing you know if you

532
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,960
adopt insecure addressing schemes like

533
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,240
the one that's vulnerable to our scan

534
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,200
that we're building

535
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,320
you know you've made yourself a little

536
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,840
bit more secure but it's not you know

537
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,000
the silver bullet that people portray to

538
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,039
be

539
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,600
so sorry the original question was how

540
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,880
do i see adoption

541
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,640
uh yeah basically take up has been

542
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,480
slowing do you think it will be

543
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,080
i think it's just i mean i think it's

544
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,520
accelerating like i don't want to give

545
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,640
any hard numbers because

546
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,760
i don't have the information to handle

547
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,120
but i think we will be seeing a lot more

548
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,919
in the future

549
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,840
especially with iot devices coming in

550
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,039
smartsheets and things

551
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,960
yeah i know i i agree i think that's

552
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,559
going to really really push it forward

553
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,960
um ian i believe you have some comments

554
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,559
and thoughts

555
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,360
yeah i'm so vivian probably knows better

556
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,559
than i do but

557
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,600
i heard a stat a couple years ago about

558
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,960
that security at your perimeter can be

559
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,919
greatly enhanced by actually using only

560
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,080
ipv6 internally

561
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,559
and translating ipv6 to ibp ipv4

562
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,679
when you actually and end up going on

563
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,760
the internet to do like web serving and

564
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,720
using other

565
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,559
protocols do you have any thoughts

566
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:37,840
around that uh

567
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,039
to be honest with you that's a new one

568
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,640
on me but i've not you know i guess this

569
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,760
just shows up not working production

570
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,559
environments

571
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,360
uh i think people are a lot more

572
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,720
familiar with configuring

573
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,240
ipv4 firewalls and all that sort of

574
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,000
thing it's very easy to misconfigure

575
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,200
ipv6

576
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,160
the the idea being is that because the

577
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,039
malware isn't aware of ipv6

578
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,320
and can't make call outs to c2 um

579
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,880
that there's some sort of defense have

580
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,640
you kind of explored that

581
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,240
uh no but i'd love to talk over that

582
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,320
later it sounds really interesting

583
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,760
sounds great awesome thank you so i had

584
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,640
a question

585
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,400
um we battle now worth tooling

586
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,919
and resources or more tooling

587
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,120
uh around security tools and

588
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,480
monitors and that around rpv4 how

589
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,480
how do we tackle or what are your

590
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,760
thoughts on how we

591
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,760
try avoid those similar things because i

592
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,520
imagine it's only going to get worse

593
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,000
with rpv6 so are there things that we

594
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,720
can do and plan to help ensure that we

595
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,400
don't suffer some of the same

596
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,679
sort of issues that we do today uh

597
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,160
i think honestly the advice about just

598
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,480
making sure that you select addresses

599
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,760
you select addresses in a way that are

600
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,160
not predictable i think would help

601
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,600
protect against the active scans i was

602
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,200
talking about obviously if you've got

603
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,320
someone that's clicked on a phishing

604
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:56,799
email

605
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,400
and you know uh on a mainstream desktop

606
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,799
using a mainstream os like it's trivial

607
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,159
to make calls about okay these are the

608
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,760
ipv6 hosts on that network

609
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,360
so obviously you know the standard stuff

610
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,799
about like don't go clicking on anything

611
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:09,280
shifting

612
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,159
you know ipv6 is not panacea for that

613
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,520
sort of thing

614
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,640
and i think this is what i'll be a bit

615
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,080
worried about is people keep thinking oh

616
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,440
ipv6 you know it's

617
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,559
um it's automatically more secure

618
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,960
not necessarily were there any examples

619
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,159
you had in mind sorry

620
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,120
i'm not overly familiar

621
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,600
ah you're on me

622
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,159
uh it was just a more general comment um

623
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:36,559
but

624
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,559
yeah thank you uh thank you you've

625
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,000
pointed that spot on

626
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,679
i've got what one little quick point to

627
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,400
make um around the

628
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,480
ipv4 space remaining um

629
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,720
it is limited and we hear about it all

630
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,919
the time i work for a company that owns

631
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,360
not only globally not a large amount of

632
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,000
ipv4 space

633
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,720
but we are seeing it and we are seeing

634
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,120
customers come to us to buy

635
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,159
ipvs for space from us because they're

636
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,039
aware

637
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,520
that it's still easily digestible and

638
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,679
computable in their infrastructure

639
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,880
and we're also seeing governments coming

640
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,480
to our organization and saying can we

641
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,159
have um can we have

642
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,440
50k ipv4 addresses please you know

643
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,360
it's becoming a marketplace oh there's

644
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,480
like gold dust yeah but

645
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,760
where government's providing as well

646
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,080
yeah realistically we are seeing a sales

647
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,720
opportunity on ipv4 so for sure yeah

648
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,760
yeah absolutely

649
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,320
so i think all of the uh regional

650
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,840
internet registries have completely run

651
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,280
out of ipv4 addresses

652
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,400
you know the last one to run it was

653
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,080
afferent and that was relatively

654
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,280
recently but yep

655
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:45,840
cleared out valuable resource

656
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,678
um

657
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,080
cool listen thanks i defeated i don't i

658
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,039
don't know what happened there i think

659
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,000
mike was just

660
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,200
satisfied with it um no but

661
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,440
the feedback has been amazing and twitch

662
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,039
is going nuts awesome talk

663
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,320
you know thanks very much thank you

664
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,240
thank you thank you great talk i should

665
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,240
really ipv6 more

666
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,960
yes awesome okay yeah no genuinely

667
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,799
you've converted me um i gave you a lot

668
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,000
of stick for it before

669
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,760
i i get it and you will continue to

670
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,480
imagine yeah i will still give you stick

671
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,760
for it to be fair but
