1
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,920
okay welcome back

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,919
um next up we have nikos who's going to

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,360
talk about it

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,880
iot and mobile security so welcome nicos

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,160
over to you uh hi everyone so uh

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,400
i hope everyone had a fun time with the

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,840
previous speakers

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,560
i'll be talking to you about securely

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,240
storing and transmitting information on

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,400
mobile and iot devices

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,519
and this is a story in development

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,920
uh so who am i i'm nick westbrook i'm a

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,880
student

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,200
from switzerland uh i usually go by

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,520
atomic nicos on the interwebs

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,960
and these are all of my socials

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,480
uh so when we're talking about cyber

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,480
security as a whole

19
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,320
i found that really rarely translates to

20
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,920
projects that involve some form of

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,760
development we adjust

22
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,280
development for applications or

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,600
developments in iot

24
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,640
um and so the map here which

25
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,800
tends to describe the cyber security

26
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,079
domains

27
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,360
isn't really applicable uh because as

28
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,400
you can see

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,200
uh if we're using a form of chronology

30
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,799
that goes from ideation

31
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,360
to a potential incident where ideation

32
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,640
would be the start of your idea when

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,320
your project is born

34
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,360
uh the development itself of the project

35
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,280
the production of the project when you

36
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,280
know all the building blocks have been

37
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,320
added together

38
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,320
and you're starting to put it out there

39
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,320
educating your users

40
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,960
uh to finally deploying your project so

41
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,759
that it's you know

42
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,240
available to everyone uh to finally

43
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,720
having your incident which is something

44
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,720
we don't usually consider and should

45
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,159
actually consider in one of those

46
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,920
workflows

47
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,159
so

48
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,079
i'll ask you to keep an eye just on the

49
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,079
background of the previous

50
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,200
uh mind map because that's the thing

51
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,960
that will be changing

52
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,200
and as you can see all the nodes that

53
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,840
relate to cyber security domains

54
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,040
are the ones changing

55
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,840
over time so from ideation to

56
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,318
development

57
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:13,360
to production to deployment

58
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,080
and then finally incidents so the idea

59
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,640
wasn't

60
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,520
that you you know read everything and it

61
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,879
was just to see that it spreads

62
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,840
everywhere

63
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,920
so maybe we can talk about finding a

64
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,680
root cause right

65
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,360
um i circled a few of these nodes in

66
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,720
red and just by thinking a little

67
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,280
we could possibly determine that i know

68
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,200
developers are to blame

69
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,519
uh that might be a contentious statement

70
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:42,720
it actually is

71
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,560
because we're also talking about

72
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,760
managers

73
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,879
we're talking about the rest of the

74
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,800
hierarchy all those people

75
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,400
are involved at some point in the

76
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,319
development process and

77
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,800
they are also responsible for certain

78
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,800
decisions

79
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,680
now why am i giving this talk well i

80
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,599
stand a certain crossroads

81
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,800
at a kind of a goldilocks area between

82
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,800
development and infosec i am a developer

83
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,000
first

84
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,120
and so i'm in that very niche area of

85
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,640
actually having some awareness on both

86
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,958
sides

87
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,440
some developers are also infosec

88
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,560
adjacent

89
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,239
they they you know have some knowledge

90
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,599
of infosec they

91
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,519
know how to secure their forms and these

92
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,280
kinds of things and that's also pretty

93
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,319
nice

94
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,840
but often when you're in an enterprise

95
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,959
situation you get the big gap

96
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,400
between infosecond developers and

97
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,319
that is actually scary it leads to some

98
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,920
situations like

99
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,360
uh an incident happening and

100
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,599
cyber security professionals not taking

101
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,120
liability because they weren't invited

102
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,879
into the process

103
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,360
and that's something we tend to try to

104
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,120
avoid

105
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,159
finally uh i'm at a certain nexus of

106
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,080
domains i study

107
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,760
in information systems and service

108
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,280
sciences which

109
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,840
sounds uh big uh it involves development

110
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,599
management ethics security

111
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,400
and regulations all bunched up in a big

112
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:12,959
bowl of

113
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,720
knowledge although it isn't equal time

114
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,840
it looks something like this

115
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,040
i also pursue infosec in ocean as you

116
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,919
know on the side

117
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,320
uh and i'm trying to kind of migrate

118
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,040
there

119
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,600
over time so what are we going to talk

120
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,240
about

121
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,280
well i'm going to give you a small brief

122
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,960
overview of the terminology i used you

123
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,960
know in the title of the talk

124
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,960
i'm going to kind of say why

125
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,160
we would want to reduce the risks from

126
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,080
the people involved to the technology at

127
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,759
hand to

128
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,800
the risks that both of these produce by

129
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,040
existing by doing mistakes

130
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,960
and then the fallout that happens if you

131
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,080
don't consider these risks

132
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,840
uh i'm going to talk about risk

133
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,360
mitigation

134
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,720
and then finally i'm going to do a small

135
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,440
back and forth of things i've actually

136
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,000
heard

137
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,560
being said and things i probably should

138
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,800
have responded at the time

139
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,240
and that is going to kind of be the

140
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,360
flow of our talk so

141
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,880
the ecosystem i talked about iot

142
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,840
i talked about mobile devices

143
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,160
involvement

144
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,000
i talked about information transmission

145
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,240
and i talked about information storage

146
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,080
so these things kind of scale down an

147
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,520
abstraction so i'm going to take it into

148
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,280
reverse order

149
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,000
information storage for the basics it's

150
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,479
just

151
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,120
ones and zeros stored somewhere either

152
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,320
in ram

153
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,000
in ssds or sd cards or hard disks

154
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,199
and in some form it's either raw so it

155
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,120
could be direct sensor output

156
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,120
and that kind of information or it could

157
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,160
be processed

158
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,720
like text files or excel files or json

159
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,319
files or just databases

160
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,759
as well and now that we have information

161
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,080
we might want to actually transmit it

162
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,000
so the nice people that you know

163
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,199
defined networking defined the osi stack

164
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,960
which is a stack of seven layers going

165
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,880
from physical which is the closest to

166
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,479
you know your uh physical appliance

167
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,840
to the bare bones network to the highest

168
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,560
layer which is the closest to the user

169
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,080
if we clean that up it looks something

170
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,840
like this and

171
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,400
when you're a part of a network maybe as

172
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,680
a mobile device

173
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,000
and you're trying to send information

174
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,120
usually go

175
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,880
through some form of physical media

176
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,680
which itself doesn't necessarily need to

177
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,039
present information to the user uh when

178
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,560
we're talking about iot

179
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,160
uh we're talking about peer-to-peer

180
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,840
connections which involve

181
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,360
more layers than just your physical

182
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,880
media because

183
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,479
iot can also display stuff it can

184
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,319
just interact can just transmit some

185
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,680
base information

186
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,639
and that is something we are going to

187
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,039
talk about

188
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,880
in terms of transmission itself the

189
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,960
information isn't usually just broadcast

190
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,240
in the wild

191
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,880
usually you have some form of packaging

192
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,599
which

193
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,160
in itself like these protocol data units

194
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,960
that are used

195
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,880
to package information this one is the

196
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,960
ethernet protocol data unit

197
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,160
uh give some form of uh structure

198
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,440
for example this one has

199
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,759
a destination address and a source

200
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:26,639
address

201
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,800
uh the data itself kind of like a letter

202
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,360
you know you put a letter in an envelope

203
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,240
uh you have some postage seal uh stamps

204
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,280
which would be

205
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,720
your flags for your uh ethernet pdu

206
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,280
and also an integrity uh check which

207
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,840
would then be your seal for your letter

208
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,160
there we go mobile devices in themselves

209
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,599
at a base level

210
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:52,639
it's just something that stores and

211
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,960
transmits information

212
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,280
which in itself also allows some form of

213
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,360
user interaction

214
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,240
at the most abstract that's what it is

215
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,840
and if we're developing for such a

216
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,800
device

217
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,400
we can specify some additional

218
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,000
requirements like the need for

219
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
networking the need for api calls that

220
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,319
need

221
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,440
for information storage and this

222
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,039
has been made more accessible to

223
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,960
developers around the world

224
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,919
because for platforms such as android uh

225
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,400
used to only have a java to develop for

226
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:22,879
them

227
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,680
then it migrated to kotlin and now you

228
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,440
have multiple languages that can do that

229
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,879
for ios it's the same thing from

230
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,479
objective c to swift

231
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,399
and now multiple things can develop for

232
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,919
them

233
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,880
some cross os development stacks include

234
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,479
react native or flutter and

235
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,000
this availability and this

236
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,200
accessibility to mobile development

237
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,120
has two effects it's easier to develop

238
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,240
apps

239
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,279
but it's also harder to

240
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,839
find the the vulnerabilities

241
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,920
uh in terms of iot well it the internet

242
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,880
of things

243
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,880
doesn't just include one thing it

244
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,640
includes smart everything

245
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,399
it's fridges it's watches it's coffee

246
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,600
machines uh it's teledildonics uh

247
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,920
the talk i linked here is smee at defcon

248
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,800
27

249
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,680
talking about hacking uh dildos so

250
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,680
that's always fun

251
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,519
so is that what we're talking about not

252
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,160
really we're talking about iot clusters

253
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,760
an iot cluster is usually a cluster of

254
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,399
iot devices which are service centric

255
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,160
they all do usually one to a few things

256
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,000
for example we can talk about an iot

257
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,519
sensor grid that measures carbon

258
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,080
monoxide

259
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,200
levels in the city streets

260
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,680
these iot clusters kind of form the iot

261
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,279
triad where your iot devices will

262
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,399
connect to mobile devices or servers

263
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,360
or whatnot via certain forms of

264
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,440
communication

265
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,720
such as potentially gsm networks wi-fi

266
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,200
long-range radio frequencies bluetooth

267
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,000
nfc

268
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,839
and the like there's multiple options

269
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,360
so why would we want to do this well

270
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:09,920
first

271
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,680
uh we're going to talk about the people

272
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,200
at hand

273
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,000
the technology on which it's based on

274
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,600
the risks that those produce

275
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,720
and yet again the fallout

276
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,160
so users ah quite simple infographic

277
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,839
they're your best friend they're also

278
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,760
your worst enemy

279
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,600
uh if you've heard of that user

280
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,519
described in the comic

281
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,000
it's a user that always has ludicrous

282
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,200
problems

283
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,519
so the basic morality is to love them

284
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,800
for the income they bring

285
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,160
but hate them for the problems they

286
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,399
bring

287
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,880
and in terms of people involved you also

288
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,240
have developers and managers in the rest

289
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,279
of the hierarchy

290
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,519
because at some point at some level uh

291
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,480
before or

292
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,320
when you reach the big seas after an

293
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,079
incident someone might

294
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,640
actually try to let everything burn down

295
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,240
just to save face

296
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,760
and that is an issue you might need to

297
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,160
contend with

298
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,440
so if we're talking about the technology

299
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,240
at hand uh we have information storage

300
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,360
which is a basic element when we're

301
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,880
talking about iot

302
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,480
about just databases data dumps servers

303
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,680
log files and apis

304
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,760
all of them have that thing in common

305
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,519
and what information storage has in

306
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,200
common

307
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,720
is that it's stored on some form of

308
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,480
physical media somewhere

309
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,200
so if just that is exposed you're

310
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,920
already in danger

311
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,680
in terms of information transmission

312
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,120
itself

313
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,560
it usually goes through some form of

314
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,399
medium so we can talk about

315
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,519
wires like usb ethernet and the like

316
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,079
proximity wireless like bluetooth nfc

317
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,440
stuff like that

318
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,399
and uh wireless like wi-fi like gsm

319
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:48,959
networks

320
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,560
and the like and then an important part

321
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,760
of information transmission is the

322
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,639
availability

323
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:55,839
when you're talking about a service it

324
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,880
needs to be available otherwise people

325
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,639
will miss it and finally

326
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,480
information transmission does rely on

327
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,399
protocols which rely on

328
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,320
which defined data structure which

329
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,040
define the need for authenticity of the

330
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,519
data

331
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,760
for authentication of the data for the

332
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,880
integrity of the data

333
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,200
and finally for the security of the data

334
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,040
how secure is your data

335
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,320
so now that we've talked about the

336
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,800
people and the technology we can just

337
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,800
have a small intermediary conclusion

338
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,399
that all of this is a huge

339
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,120
attack surface

340
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,880
so let's talk about risks well in terms

341
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,680
of iot

342
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,639
uh there's a saying the s in iot stands

343
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,040
for security which has been

344
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,760
said from times immemorial and said

345
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,360
recently by one of the beer farmers

346
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,000
let's talk about storage sd cards are

347
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,920
vulnerable to physical access

348
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,760
they have an easy i o most computers

349
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,200
have an sd port or

350
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,360
some adapter that allows that and they

351
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,839
contain possibly juicy files like ssh

352
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:58,959
files

353
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,240
which probably shouldn't be stored on

354
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,240
such a device

355
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,519
microprocessors themselves well

356
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,200
you can get the byte code off the

357
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,560
microprocessor and then find all the

358
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,079
static values within

359
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,240
or also just reverse engineer the the

360
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,560
code

361
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,079
in terms of transmission we can talk

362
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,240
about bluetooth flow energy which is a

363
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,920
plain text byte stream which can be

364
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,360
passively observed

365
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,720
or attacked and

366
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,040
the the existence of bluetooth profiles

367
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,279
which kind of help with interoperability

368
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,639
of devices

369
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,800
actually helps attackers more than it

370
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,639
does developers

371
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,880
because they can say okay this responds

372
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,160
to that protocol

373
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,800
so uh it will have that type of data and

374
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,120
it kind of helps

375
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,199
um tautology zero so fellow happy hour

376
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,600
card holder and buck fast enthusiast

377
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,240
actually did an entire tweet thread

378
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,720
that was taken and posted on the pen

379
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,320
test partner's website

380
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,160
about hacking a bluetooth low energy

381
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,440
smartlock

382
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,880
an interesting read long range radio

383
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,560
frequencies some data is transmitted

384
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,440
over that

385
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,560
well if you have any compatible lora

386
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,760
receiver you can grab all the data

387
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,760
finally in terms of wi-fi you have

388
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,360
packet capture and all the other

389
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,639
standard risks which apply

390
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,399
uh in terms of storage itself well we

391
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,760
go in in terms of mobile devices

392
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,079
the storage it's the same thing as iot

393
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,199
except

394
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,440
you have way more files you might store

395
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,560
some music on and i

396
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,120
on a mobile device you might store some

397
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,399
videos some

398
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,040
juicy files some configuration files

399
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,040
things you might not even know are there

400
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,440
and that's something that uh that to be

401
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,440
accounted for

402
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,920
if you root or jailbreak your device

403
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,480
well

404
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,440
you give access to your cache data where

405
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,199
you can get access to your cache data

406
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:55,760
which

407
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,519
is usually where apps hide all their

408
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,600
juicy secrets as well

409
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,800
some windows or mac os

410
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,800
applications such as my phone explorer

411
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,320
or amazing actually allow

412
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,040
access to a portion of the cache data

413
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,639
the one that is not

414
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,680
intrinsically private and that also

415
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,399
allows

416
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,480
attackers to have a certain idea of the

417
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,600
scope

418
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,639
if we just talk about the most recent

419
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,040
issues between epic games and apple for

420
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,000
example

421
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,480
where uh ios users had to jailbreak

422
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,079
their devices to install

423
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,279
fortnite well that could have been a

424
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,160
part of uh

425
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,680
you know could have been an issue at

426
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,079
some point so is your eight-year-old

427
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,440
video game addict

428
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,440
uh a part of your threat mod that's a

429
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,639
question you need to ask yourself

430
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,560
nowadays

431
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,959
and then in terms of memory well memory

432
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:45,839
uh

433
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,040
issues can occur for example if you

434
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,120
don't handle concurrency correctly you

435
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,160
can have some pretty funky and

436
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,680
destructive results

437
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,759
which is not something you might want in

438
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,240
an application

439
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,160
in terms of transmission well we already

440
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,560
talked about bluetooth energy and wi-fi

441
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,399
uh but we can also talk about nfc so uh

442
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,639
ben earlier talked about uh skimming

443
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:09,600
well that's

444
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,320
a pretty big risk that people need to

445
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,880
contend with

446
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,519
in terms of services well phones

447
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,839
let you access a wide range of services

448
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,800
from geolocation

449
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,240
to storage to sensors which in of itself

450
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,560
doesn't seem like a horrible idea

451
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,839
but if you consider the usage of such

452
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:34,560
sensors to

453
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,839
possibly predict sleep patterns well

454
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,360
uh if you hijack that type of

455
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,279
application you can possibly say

456
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,959
oh you know that person is sleeping

457
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,800
let's go rob them or do other horrible

458
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,920
things to them

459
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,519
so yeah that's an issue to contend with

460
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,000
as well

461
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,920
in terms of servers well that's

462
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,839
something i'm not an expert

463
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,000
at it's actually not in my area of

464
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,959
knowledge

465
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,600
so here's someone doing something with

466
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,560
web servers

467
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,480
and google is your friend as always

468
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,599
so story time uh so a dutch cyber

469
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,640
security company

470
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,640
uh recently did a study on smart watches

471
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,240
so they bought a smart watch that allows

472
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,160
them to track children so their own

473
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,880
child

474
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,240
for their child quote unquote and

475
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,799
so they registered the uh registered it

476
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:23,599
installed the app

477
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,640
and did everything correctly they then

478
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,160
observed some communication between

479
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,240
servers and the app and so just

480
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,679
installed burp suit in the middle so

481
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,520
purp suit being a web application pen

482
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,120
testing tool

483
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,120
and so what did they notice they noticed

484
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,400
that was using an id

485
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,360
to grab the geolocation data and what

486
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:41,919
happened

487
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,919
when they changed the id well the

488
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,559
location data changed so of course they

489
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,160
tried to replicate this in the browser

490
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,559
that didn't work which brings out

491
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,960
an issue of the level of authentication

492
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,760
which was

493
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,559
correct but not of authorization because

494
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,320
they weren't allowed to see that data

495
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,360
technically and so this might not seem

496
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,480
like a big issue

497
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,360
except that it exposed the location of

498
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,480
potentially

499
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,880
hundreds of thousands of children which

500
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,480
in itself is pretty horrible

501
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,280
so have a happy halloween horror story

502
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,320
story

503
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,480
uh this issue which i just mentioned uh

504
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,720
has in the meantime been fixed

505
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,840
thankfully so let's talk about fallout

506
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,120
well fallout can be measured by three

507
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:27,760
metrics

508
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,480
kind of the amount and sensitivity of

509
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,880
the information that was exposed

510
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,880
the speed at which the service recovered

511
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,880
and how the entity responded so that

512
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,160
would be the company that

513
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,600
produced set application if

514
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,280
the information is very sensitive and

515
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,640
the entity responds worldly

516
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,320
it erodes the trust in that service

517
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,640
if the information is sensitive and the

518
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,480
service takes a while to get back on its

519
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,039
feet

520
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,280
it erodes the feeling of privacy that is

521
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,039
generated by that service

522
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,640
and finally if the entity responds

523
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,039
horribly and the service recovers slowly

524
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,120
it erodes the credibility of your

525
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,200
service and your company

526
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,240
if you have all three uh box checks

527
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,919
you have something called nani shambles

528
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,840
which if you're a part of the big seas

529
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,440
of your company gives you an occasion to

530
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,679
yell

531
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,120
so let's use a

532
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,840
subject case uh the hypothetical right

533
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,360
match single scenario

534
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,640
which was envisioned by lisa forte and

535
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,280
let's discuss that so in that scenario a

536
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,080
dating service

537
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,480
has a massive data breach which exposes

538
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,160
not only its users data but some of

539
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,080
their private documents

540
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,880
and what happens is that the ceo of the

541
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,480
hypothetical company

542
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,919
doesn't disclose it to the relevant

543
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,840
authorities or to the users

544
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,520
and finally when they're facing legal

545
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,880
action because it's been you know

546
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,559
leaked uh they go nuclear and

547
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,760
just take down the service for a while

548
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,039
and this kind of checks all the massive

549
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,440
omnishambles boxes

550
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,679
so that's something that is a pretty

551
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,840
good example

552
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,200
in terms of fallout we can also just

553
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,960
quantify followed by how the entity

554
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,720
responded

555
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,760
i'm going to use three small test cases

556
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,280
for the good well you have like an

557
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,440
information disclosure

558
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,360
in some type of new service in an api

559
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,760
which is solved quickly high bug bounty

560
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,840
that's pretty good

561
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,919
information disclosure of certain users

562
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,039
of a form

563
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:30,480
solved kind of slowly that's okay

564
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,600
some things take time but if you have a

565
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,000
really

566
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,039
chatty api uh which exposes all of its

567
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,159
users data like

568
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,080
in the case of giggle uh which

569
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,799
happened in september you get something

570
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,559
called a dumpster fire

571
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,440
because especially if you say that there

572
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,200
was no incident

573
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,000
uh that's actually pretty horrible what

574
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,559
didn't help

575
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,840
in this uh case of pr disasters is that

576
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,960
uh the ceo of said company also well

577
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,200
antagonize the infosec commuted which is

578
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:03,520
not

579
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,880
a great move on their part so let's talk

580
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,360
about risk mitigation

581
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,480
well in terms of iot development

582
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,600
in terms of storage it's avoiding to add

583
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,200
upstream critical files to your

584
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,679
iot device that would be ssh files it

585
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:20,240
would be

586
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,640
configuration files stuff like that

587
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,320
because if you have an ssh file that

588
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,120
allows me

589
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,520
to gain access to the entire company's

590
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,480
repositories

591
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,159
which is something i've seen in the wild

592
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,799
that's a bad move

593
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,440
if you have operations logs that would

594
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,480
be

595
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,400
the storing the entirety of the data you

596
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,400
generate that's also a bad move

597
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,799
because it's better to just store state

598
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,559
changes and general logs

599
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,720
and then error descriptions and the data

600
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,000
that produce the error

601
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,720
in error logs that allows you to kind of

602
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,960
segment the information

603
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,919
finally nice thing is to not produce

604
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,280
anything that can't receive firmware

605
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,880
updates because even though your device

606
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,480
is 100 secure now

607
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,600
you have no clue how it's going to

608
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,400
evolve in the future

609
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,880
in terms of transmission itself well you

610
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,159
can define and use standards for

611
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:09,840
protocol data units like the ethernet

612
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,640
packet we used

613
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,559
we talked about earlier like ieee

614
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,360
750 for float representation integers

615
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,080
characters

616
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,400
etc that kind of allows you to

617
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,400
have a certain control over the data

618
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,240
you're sending mapping it out

619
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,760
maybe detecting some errors in the

620
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,440
format and

621
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,960
check maybe if you can detect some

622
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,880
modification

623
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,039
another underlying advantage is also

624
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,400
that allows you to compress if you're

625
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,159
using binary representation of certain

626
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,000
data types

627
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,960
like the example shown here a few bonus

628
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,000
points you can get is

629
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,280
like if your framework is extensible

630
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,280
if at some point you need to add some

631
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,720
form of data type so you're pushing your

632
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,000
firmware update

633
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,799
well you can also modify your pdu with

634
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:55,600
minimal

635
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,400
uh repercussions another good point is

636
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,000
potentially validating the integrity of

637
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,120
your data

638
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,159
which is pretty nice another idea is

639
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,280
possibly adding

640
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,640
a time stamp in some form to avoid

641
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,159
replay attacks so that some data isn't

642
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,600
replayed or some data isn't

643
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,360
sent back to you over and over

644
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,440
all right in terms of mobile development

645
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,280
uh if you're one of the

646
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,400
90 of devices uh that either has ios or

647
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,600
android

648
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,919
well that's pretty nice as an operating

649
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,280
system

650
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,640
well you can have some pretty

651
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,480
funky ways of storing preferences like i

652
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,559
don't know json files somewhere

653
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,679
most os including the two i've cited

654
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,120
actually have a default library for that

655
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,000
have default methods for handling that

656
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,320
same thing for opening files and

657
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,559
you can actually hide files sandbox them

658
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,440
in in your mobile application

659
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,360
finally if you're handling serialized

660
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,880
data

661
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,640
it's preferable to use an internal

662
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,120
database system for

663
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,678
input output and concurrency issues

664
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,480
in terms of memory management well you

665
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,480
can use a single object instance design

666
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,200
patterns

667
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,120
which sound like a complicated thing but

668
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,480
basically it means that

669
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,480
one instance of an object a container

670
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,080
for data is accessible at any moment

671
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,120
from anywhere

672
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,440
which is pretty convenient but kind of

673
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,880
is limited in terms of

674
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,279
access because you don't know who is

675
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,559
accessing your data

676
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,080
what part of your app is accessing your

677
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,600
data

678
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,799
another part is potentially

679
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,360
asynchronicity which solves concurrency

680
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,080
issues

681
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,000
which helps you serialize some

682
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
operations that take a lot of time

683
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,279
and overall a pretty good thing

684
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:44,960
finally in terms of development

685
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,120
workflows uh you have waterfall and

686
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,159
linear development

687
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,559
uh which is a pretty old way of dealing

688
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:51,840
with development and

689
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,559
in projects they produce very few

690
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,159
tangible products

691
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,200
you have an app that's being developed

692
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,840
that's all so if you can't evaluate the

693
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,360
security of your app

694
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,080
you can evaluate its quality as well

695
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,760
which is an issue

696
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,679
in terms of agile development well the

697
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,360
lack of security council

698
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,200
on the artifacts you produce during

699
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,039
every sprint

700
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,600
is also an issue because you might

701
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,360
snowball yourself into vulnerability

702
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,919
hell at some point

703
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,600
so let's move on to things i've heard

704
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,200
so i'm going to take the case of an

705
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,640
information security professional

706
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,679
a developer and a manager so it's an app

707
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,200
it needs to look good we'll sort out the

708
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,720
data later

709
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,400
yeah big no it's easier to adapt

710
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,440
a ui to a service than the reverse

711
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,120
if you just have a ui and nothing going

712
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,799
on behind it

713
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,400
and you're trying to rush implement a

714
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,679
service you're going to have issues

715
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,039
in terms of software so they installed

716
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,159
our software that means that they want

717
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,159
to share the data they generate with us

718
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,159
well that's an issue too because well if

719
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,200
you've seen juan's talk about gdpr

720
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,360
that's a big no-no at least in europe

721
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,200
and you can't just assume what

722
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,480
users want from your service

723
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,640
in terms of data persistence uh data

724
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,919
persists for one second

725
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,559
what's the worst that can happen well

726
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,640
bluetooth or driving uh has been the

727
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,240
thing at least since 2003.

728
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,120
it's been talked about at defcon 2000 uh

729
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,640
defcon 11.

730
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,960
so yeah it is still an issue

731
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,799
uh we don't use application ids with our

732
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,159
location data what do you mean they can

733
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:31,120
be tracked

734
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,039
well i'd invite you to look at the

735
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,440
privacy project in 2019 by the new york

736
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,559
times

737
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,360
which actually shown that location data

738
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,360
aggregators from like ad services

739
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,440
have access to a ton of location data

740
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,720
information

741
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,559
so potentially tracking people in the

742
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:47,840
white house and the pentagon and

743
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,400
congress

744
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,840
stuff like that so it's pretty pretty

745
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,200
important

746
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,880
so yeah location using and transmitting

747
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,400
devices can be uh

748
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,440
choiced uh managers

749
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,120
saying they can't coordinate security

750
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,279
suggestions with the rest of the tasks

751
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:06,159
well first of all the term of ideal uh

752
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:07,440
is probably going to have you yelling

753
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:07,760
into

754
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,000
internally but uh please be politically

755
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,600
correct about your response

756
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,559
uh using a mock-up-based workflow uh is

757
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,240
pretty good where you mock the data

758
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,039
calls

759
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,120
and once your service is ready you just

760
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,840
add in the correct data calls

761
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,520
so yeah so what are our conclusions

762
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,399
well iot is the stuff of nightmares i

763
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,039
don't tell your ciso about it

764
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,320
improvements in the field aren't

765
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,799
standards yet

766
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,120
it will take a while to get there

767
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,799
security is a matter of being consistent

768
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:39,520
on all fronts

769
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,240
you may have the best web or api

770
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,840
security systems in place

771
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,000
if your iot is vulnerable you're

772
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,520
vulnerable

773
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,360
and my own two cents are to have an

774
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,039
infosec professional assigned to the dev

775
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,080
team

776
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,840
which will help you catch errors along

777
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,559
the way a hidden conclusion is that

778
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:57,200
since

779
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,559
iot is a great part of the backbone

780
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:04,080
of networking nowadays it's

781
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,039
an imperfect backbone nowadays it's very

782
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,360
vulnerable we need to handle that

783
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,200
because many enterprise systems many

784
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,919
people rely on iot nowadays

785
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,960
so yeah um this talk is available under

786
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,760
cc by

787
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,960
uh by essay which is an open license

788
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,120
and thank you to all these fantastic

789
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,439
people

790
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,840
you can find me here

791
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,880
that's brilliant nikos thank you very

792
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,720
much for that um did we capture any

793
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,600
questions

794
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,720
i can see one already so

795
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,679
the question here from i can't even

796
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,159
figure out how to pronounce that

797
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,000
how do we recommend managing the risk of

798
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,159
iot devices in a corporate network

799
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,960
uh don't connect anything to an outside

800
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,120
network first of all

801
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,960
is big point and

802
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,120
don't have anything that is accessible

803
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,559
from any outside uh

804
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,480
point if you're going to have something

805
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,080
uh you know broadcasting some

806
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:08,960
information

807
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,559
make sure that it's not accessible by

808
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,880
public uh by public visitors or things

809
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,200
like that

810
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,320
good advice um i don't think we've got

811
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,760
any other questions

812
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,240
and you've uh you've absolutely nailed

813
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:22,880
the time

814
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,880
because well done now yeah you have

815
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,399
indeed um

816
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:29,279
so thank you very much well done and um

817
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:36,159
yeah great stuff thanks a lot
