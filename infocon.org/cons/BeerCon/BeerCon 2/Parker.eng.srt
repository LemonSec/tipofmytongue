1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,720
welcome back

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,240
um we have with us parker who's going to

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,719
tell us when i tried to hack a frill

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,480
machine and what that taught me about

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,040
ocean

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,880
and life now i have no idea what a frail

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,800
machine is it's been bothering me since

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,480
the cfp got submitted

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,680
i didn't want to google it because i

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,760
didn't want to ruin the surprise so

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,359
parker please take it away and please

12
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,800
tell us what a free machine

13
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,840
is will do good afternoon

14
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,840
pasta pals and spaghetti gals name is

15
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,079
parker and we'll just get right into the

16
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,280
slides

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,719
so to start off a bit about me i

18
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,239
got my undergraduate in network security

19
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,559
currently attending school for a

20
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:43,520
master's

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,039
in cyber defense uh not sure

22
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,280
why they let me back in but i'll take it

23
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,800
nonetheless

24
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,160
my main interests are in

25
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,280
open source software i am very

26
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,920
into the mycroft project which is kind

27
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,160
of like a google home or an alexa

28
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,720
if it didn't work as well but respected

29
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,320
your privacy

30
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,400
i always figured i was fairly

31
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,520
introverted

32
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,680
but then i moved on in life and found

33
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,200
him fairly extrovert and

34
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,960
the previous assumption was just because

35
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,280
nobody in my high school liked me

36
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,320
and i personally view that

37
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,759
i have a lot of things to learn

38
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,600
affectionately refer to myself as smooth

39
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,799
brain

40
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,520
i i might know a couple things but

41
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,200
there's plenty more out there for me to

42
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:31,840
learn

43
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,840
and the picture there of the horribly

44
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,040
ruined art piece is because in a speech

45
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,560
class in college we were told to make a

46
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,280
collage

47
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,200
and i didn't know what a collage was i

48
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,880
asked someone they said it's a

49
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,560
picture that's got a lot of pictures of

50
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,320
you and stuff about you

51
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,640
to kind of summarize your personality

52
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,360
and this is what i came up with

53
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,920
i feel like it encapsulates things well

54
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,799
enough

55
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,560
but you're not here to just hear about

56
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,479
me you're here to hear about

57
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,680
for real machines but what exactly are

58
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,840
for real machines well what if you took

59
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,280
ice cream and ruined it

60
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,920
in a way when you go to a gas station

61
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,520
uh just something like that you'll often

62
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:17,920
see

63
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,959
these real machines there they are

64
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,360
it's a freezer full of these cups that

65
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,200
have a very solid

66
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,520
ice cream composite in there you take

67
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,640
one of those out

68
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,200
you put it inside that cup that you see

69
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:31,920
in the bottom

70
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,840
left-hand part of it press one of those

71
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,120
buttons to tell

72
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,080
it how thick you want it to be blended

73
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,000
then the cup goes up behind that screen

74
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,480
and blends it you then take it to the

75
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,000
counter pay for it and

76
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,160
there you go you got ice cream in a cup

77
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,000
that screen there

78
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,400
supposed to draw your eye in by playing

79
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,000
little different animations of the

80
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,680
various flavors that they have trying to

81
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,959
promote it

82
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,360
uh i make fun of it a lot i have ate a

83
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,239
lot of them though

84
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,360
they're not good they're just there

85
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,319
some further examples of these machines

86
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:04,879
there's

87
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,040
some out there that don't have a screen

88
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,720
there's some that are

89
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,000
more complex than this but odds are if

90
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,920
you go to a gas station

91
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,360
somewhere in the united states you'll

92
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,040
see one of these they are

93
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,360
fairly widespread and if you get the

94
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,760
chance to try one do it at least once

95
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,640
just so you can get an understanding of

96
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,760
what

97
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,680
what the hell is this thing but

98
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,879
what interested me and my friends about

99
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,840
this

100
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,200
is well rather how i got started

101
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,400
was i went to a rather small school in a

102
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,599
small town

103
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,400
with only one place that was open 24

104
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,360
hours a day

105
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,239
and that was a gas station a friend of

106
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,920
mine got a job there

107
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,680
and so he would be there late into the

108
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,200
evenings as well

109
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,120
the rest of us if we can't sleep we

110
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,120
can't we just are up late working on

111
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,400
homeworks or projects

112
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,879
we would spend our we would uh take a

113
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:01,680
break

114
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,599
walk down to the gas station get some

115
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,120
snacks hang out with our friend for a

116
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,120
bit kill some time

117
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,120
these machines do break occasionally as

118
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,640
anything does and one time the screen on

119
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,639
one of the machines wasn't working

120
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,600
so friend went over reached underneath

121
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:19,839
it

122
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,918
and flipped the switch to turn it off

123
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,000
and on again

124
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,479
but when it was booting back up we

125
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:27,360
noticed

126
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,680
that for a brief moment it showed us

127
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,600
something that looked like a linux-like

128
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,120
bootloader

129
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,160
and that got our minds going thinking is

130
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:38,639
there

131
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,160
an underlying operating system

132
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,160
underneath this is there something more

133
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,440
to this what all could we do

134
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,160
so we began looking into this situation

135
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,680
our stated goal at the beginning was to

136
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,880
get a copy

137
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,199
of the operating system that is running

138
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,000
on there

139
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,759
we didn't know anything else about it we

140
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,759
just know we wanted it

141
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,639
so condensed that idea was get a copy of

142
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,360
the iso so we can install on a computer

143
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,199
with the hopes of our research being

144
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,199
that if you installed it on any generic

145
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,400
pc

146
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,039
it would the os would recognize the cd

147
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:15,680
bay

148
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,720
as a blender

149
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,400
so to get started on that it turned into

150
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,680
calling for real to try to talk to their

151
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,240
support

152
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,759
to see if we could get the iso

153
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,919
that did not work and we probably

154
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,120
confused a

155
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,240
a lot of their uh their support staff

156
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,639
all in the on the name of research very

157
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,560
important research learning a whole lot

158
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,240
getting getting a deep in inspection of

159
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:46,960
the company

160
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,400
to understand more uh more phone calls

161
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,199
are made more

162
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,680
more chats were made trying to see if we

163
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,280
could find a way into their programming

164
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,080
department

165
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,919
to see if anybody there could help us

166
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,400
out with it and we just kept trying to

167
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,360
go

168
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,240
further and further to see if we could

169
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,160
get into the company somehow

170
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,000
to get more information

171
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,440
um what we eventually summarized was

172
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,000
one of the ways to be able to get into

173
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,240
it if we can't get into the company

174
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,720
was a a small set of potential

175
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,960
vulnerabilities they might have

176
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,400
so the first of these was physical

177
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,560
um i know some of you might have just

178
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,840
learned what for real is

179
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,160
but it's the uh old

180
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,639
uh physical penetration testing adage of

181
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,560
do you know what a

182
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,560
bank inspector looks like what if real

183
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,319
machine repairman looks like

184
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,960
anything like that you probably not and

185
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,160
nobody else really does

186
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,880
you just grab a pair of khakis a shirt

187
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,560
that looks like the same color as the

188
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,520
brand

189
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,039
with a clipboard and maybe a bag of

190
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,960
tools going to a gas station say your

191
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,479
real machine's been acting up i've been

192
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,000
sent by the company to take a look at it

193
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,960
here's sign here

194
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,800
they sign a thing so they can feel like

195
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,160
it's official

196
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,240
uh two good things could come from that

197
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,000
you get physical access to the machine

198
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,720
to do

199
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,120
further inspection further research

200
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,560
potentially a back door

201
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,639
plus if you make it legit enough you

202
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,080
could probably grab a whole bunch of

203
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,720
those for real cups and make out with

204
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,520
some nice ice cream yourself

205
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,800
the other way we figured its potential

206
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,800
to compromise one of those machines

207
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,639
is based off of the way the

208
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,479
splash screens work the screens that

209
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,360
show you all the new flavors and stuff

210
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,319
uh i doubt for real would make the

211
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,000
bargain or the bet that

212
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,280
gas station wi-fi is reliable enough to

213
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,479
uh uh keep those things connected

214
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,879
because those machines update with new

215
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:51,599
flavors

216
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:52,960
whenever they come out whenever they're

217
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,759
deployed but nobody at the gas station

218
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,520
would be trying to do that nobody knows

219
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,280
anything about that

220
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,720
so that leads to the assumption that

221
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,479
there is probably a very cheap

222
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,639
wireless connection to a cell tower

223
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:05,680
nearby

224
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,680
probably whatever for real was able to

225
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,720
negotiate

226
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,520
on the cheap end with a regional or

227
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,800
nationwide

228
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,680
cell provider so that introduces the

229
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,000
potential of a stingray to intercept

230
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,919
that connection making a fake cell tower

231
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:20,319
and

232
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,680
seeing what kind of connection you could

233
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,520
intercept

234
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,960
as that leads to further things of if

235
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,479
those animations are sent over

236
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,080
over the internet they're coming from a

237
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,000
server somewhere and those

238
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,760
are being that servers receiving them

239
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,839
from somewhere else probably somewhere

240
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,839
inside for real's network

241
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,320
this is a bit of a jump and a making i'm

242
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,839
making a lot of assumptions here but

243
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,440
i'll explain why

244
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,320
in a minute but if though if you can get

245
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,320
into that server which i'm going to

246
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,839
take a shot in the dark and say it's

247
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,080
probably some s3 bucket out there

248
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,320
then you could potentially make your way

249
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,399
back into for real's network

250
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,519
and laterally escalate yourself to the

251
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,240
point where you

252
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,680
have access to their uh copy of the

253
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,279
operating system that is flashed on

254
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,839
those machines

255
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,399
or you could purchase a for real machine

256
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,279
for yourself

257
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,200
however we were broke college students

258
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,880
so we didn't have the

259
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,640
couple thousands of dollars to buy an

260
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,000
ice cream machine for the lulz

261
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,600
the reason

262
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,320
i didn't want to try to do these while i

263
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:26,959
was

264
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,880
in this project was because i didn't

265
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,480
want to go to ice cream jail

266
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,399
as this picture denotes this is what ice

267
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,399
cream geo looks like

268
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,240
and this is a bit of a divergent thing

269
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,160
while i was researching this

270
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,800
i was or looking up or creating the

271
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,080
slides for this rather

272
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,399
i was looking at pictures to demonstrate

273
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,360
ice cream jail

274
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,040
and i found this one i'm

275
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,440
i have no idea what's going on here but

276
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,279
i think this does summarize the

277
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,279
concept of ice cream jail fairly

278
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,680
succinctly

279
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,240
but this question kept coming back to

280
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,360
myself as i was

281
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,279
doing this project of why are you doing

282
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,640
this you're wasting a lot of time on

283
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,079
this you should be focusing on school

284
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,440
you should be focusing on

285
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,920
job applications you this isn't doing

286
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,880
anything to

287
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,279
progress your career and this comes back

288
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,000
to

289
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,040
that i in general i'm a very

290
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,839
anxious person i worry and worry and

291
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,959
don't ever make a in the in the cases

292
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,000
where i worry far too much

293
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,279
i try i almost or do talk myself out of

294
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,120
making a change in a situation

295
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,279
but i never come up with an alternative

296
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,560
that makes something better

297
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,360
so in those cases i always feel like i'm

298
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,720
doing the wrong thing but i never

299
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,320
progress it

300
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,079
but what's important about this

301
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,560
project is that it didn't have to be

302
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,440
anything

303
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,480
uh monumental or world changing

304
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,120
but it was my first soiree into doing

305
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,120
open source intelligence gathering

306
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,440
i had never done this before and i mean

307
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,839
there's a lot of things i did wrong

308
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,560
but i still did it and i learned a whole

309
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:04,959
lot

310
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,000
i got to practice with different ways of

311
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,519
calling the company or

312
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,880
different ways of negotiating that

313
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,720
conversation i got to

314
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,560
look into how the different ways the

315
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,920
machine could be compromised and what

316
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,920
potentially could come from that

317
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,440
those aren't things that i considered

318
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,600
but this dumb project enabled me

319
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,720
to think about and to work on

320
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,320
and that's something i've carried with

321
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,720
me i

322
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,320
from from that point on every time i've

323
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,920
gotten the chance to really research a

324
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,680
company or research a topic i really

325
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,519
look into it i want to figure out

326
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,519
what they're doing what their history is

327
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,440
what technologies they're using

328
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,040
and that's very very greatly

329
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,079
uh further to my career i am now in a

330
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:46,959
position where

331
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,480
i am the self-appointed security person

332
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,240
at the company i work at there was

333
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,240
nobody there who was doing security

334
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,320
and when i when i joined to be doing

335
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,240
devops for them i said i'll do security

336
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,279
and they said

337
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,240
okay so now under my wing i've taken

338
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,680
various dumb projects

339
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,079
like trying to deploy i shouldn't call

340
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,040
these dumb

341
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,240
uh trying to deploy a host-based

342
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,839
intrusion detection system

343
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,480
across our endpoints and servers using

344
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,279
waza

345
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,560
or trying to deploy key cloaks so we can

346
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,000
have sso

347
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,440
or using go fish to do a fishing

348
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,200
campaign against ourselves

349
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,959
or leading the fishing investigations

350
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,399
for when we do get them to figure out

351
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,920
how we can best remediate those types of

352
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,920
situations

353
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,760
all of this was spurred on because i

354
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,519
thought why did the why did the funny

355
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,000
ice cream machine have the linux on it

356
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,880
so the moral of this

357
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,959
project was and it's something i still

358
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,160
have to remind myself

359
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,959
very frequently is do weird projects

360
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,480
they don't have to mean anything

361
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,720
but they help immensely with teaching

362
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,200
you more

363
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,079
i hope this talk went long enough i feel

364
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,600
like a bit rushed through it but

365
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,480
oh well here are some of my links if you

366
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,000
wish to contact me through

367
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,560
any of these mediums and i would like to

368
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,519
add one last

369
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,200
note before we go into uh q a

370
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,480
that we are in a position

371
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,120
us in this the realm of not just uh

372
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,079
security but

373
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,320
in technology in general we're in a very

374
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,760
privileged position

375
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,120
to be able to use our minds as

376
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,360
our main driver for our career

377
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,480
rather than our our physical health

378
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,880
so that is something we should all take

379
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,519
care of

380
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,680
very deeply um your care very deeply

381
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,560
about

382
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,000
uh taking care of your mental health

383
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,279
taking care of the mental health of

384
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,440
others is very important

385
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,639

386
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,639

um what i i love most about this talk

448
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,000
um not the fact or the fact that it was

449
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,240
just like so open and transparent

450
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,240
but also the the fact that i think it's

451
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,680
actually really well timed

452
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,279
that a lot of the things that you've

453
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,360
mentioned kind of tie a lot of the

454
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,800
things that have been mentioned in other

455
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,040
talks so things like grabbing things

456
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,360
by the horns taking opportunities

457
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,680
something you've done

458
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,639
just trying to do things even though you

459
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,800

460
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,320
something like that

461
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,680
