and i'm gonna be talking about tokyo so

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,000
when we think

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,359
about disruptions for the internet

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,720
everyone assumes it's turning off the

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,439
power

16
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,120
crashing super tankers into support

17
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,640
structures

18
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,800
or causing mega jams by turning traffic

19
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,680
lights to red

20
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,079
but what i'm going to show you is in the

21
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,040
air

22
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,360
how in the busiest city in the world

23
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,719
just by playing around somewhere

24
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,719
with some very minor things can have

25
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,480
quite a huge material impact

26
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,920
on the world's biggest metropolis

27
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,399
welcome to tokyo the city of japan

28
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,719
they're the capital of japan

29
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,600
apart from films like godzilla kill bill

30
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,640
and tokyo drift

31
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,920
what else do people actually know about

32
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,319
this mysterious neon wonderland

33
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,320
to many it's known as the city of

34
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,600
convenience

35
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,799
so why is it called the city of

36
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,680
convenience because everything in japan

37
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,040
in tokyo is designed for perfect

38
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,720
efficiency for everyone

39
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,880
escalators everywhere vending machines

40
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,759
one one

41
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,680
at least every 12 meters if not more

42
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,439
transport has one of the best metros in

43
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,720
the world

44
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,920
so what is it like to live in this

45
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,759
paradise well what better way to show

46
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:28,240
you

47
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,320
than just [ __ ] to tell you a story so

48
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,079
let me introduce everyone to our main

49
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:32,799
character

50
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,280
han liu

51
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,920
so can i ask everyone here can they if

52
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,040
they can do something for me

53
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,720
really quickly as i go through a good

54
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,200
day for han i'd like everyone to imagine

55
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,240
they're a hacker

56
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,520
who wants to disrupt han's day it's six

57
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,720
a.m

58
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,880
and hand wakes up and rolls out of bed

59
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,320
he has a shower

60
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,479
now at 7 00 am he leaves his apartment

61
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,719
and heads 7 11 for some breakfast

62
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,520
before getting onto the metro 20 minutes

63
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,439
later he changed his lines at shinjuku

64
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,960
station

65
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,880
now it's about 12 minutes 20 air 20

66
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,399
minutes past eight

67
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,318
as he gets off the metro and starts

68
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,399
heading towards his office before

69
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,239
before he gets to his office he realizes

70
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,760
he should go out grab some lunch from

71
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,840
7-eleven so he does

72
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,280
he gets to work at 9am and then 10 hours

73
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,640
later he finishes work

74
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,160
and goes and joins his colleagues for a

75
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,640
meal out next to the station

76
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,959
after a couple of drinks and a nice meal

77
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,400
he goes home and falls asleep at 11 p.m

78
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,160
now i'm just going to ask some quick

79
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,840
fire questions

80
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,760
so who thought about turning off

81
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,040
electricity so

82
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,879
han's alarm clock would not work

83
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,280
what about disrupting 711's delivery

84
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,239
service

85
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,959
so he wouldn't get lunch who thought

86
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,360
about shutting down the metro

87
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,920
and who thought about flooding tokyo

88
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,400
well now i've talked about a good day

89
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,360
what about

90
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,599
a bad day for han what could happen to

91
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,000
ron's hands normal day-to-day life

92
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,440
well let's say it for another story with

93
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,599
han

94
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,080
so han is on his way to work and he pops

95
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,800
into seventh

96
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,120
some breakfast the first thing han sees

97
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,400
is an atm

98
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,400
now this is something i like about japan

99
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,239
as there's always an atm in all their

100
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,360
convenience stores

101
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,920
but why is that well japan is still

102
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,080
predominantly a cash-based society so

103
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,319
atms are needed everywhere

104
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,159
han walks up puts his card in and

105
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,840
selects 2000 yen

106
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,400
the atm hums for about 10 seconds before

107
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,319
spitting out his card in the end

108
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,840
now i know we've covered being around

109
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,440
it's a lot of people aren't picking up

110
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,040
cash recently but anyone used an atm

111
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,319
recently

112
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,720
how long do you know how long it takes

113
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,799
well unknown to han

114
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,040
the accuser have just skimmed his card

115
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,000
and this is an uncommon

116
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,959
occurrence in japan a case of this is a

117
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:49,840
group of nine

118
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,959
uh of six men connected to

119
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,000
uh the yakuza arrested into in 2016

120
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
for a heist of 1.8 billion yen

121
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,760
and this isn't the first case another

122
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,920
six individuals were arrested in 2017

123
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,760
for defrauding an elderly lady

124
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,720
out of 1.3 million yen now having your

125
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,560
card skimmed in the uk is quite a minor

126
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,120
thing

127
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,840
to be fair but in japan it can be quite

128
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,319
serious

129
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,798
now anne is

130
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,800
at the trans station and he reaches the

131
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,479
ticket cases he pulls out his passima

132
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,560
another beauty of the japanese lifestyle

133
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,960
but what is the passimo does anyone have

134
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,040
have a smart card for transport like

135
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,479
like the oyster card in london a passimo

136
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,240
i would describe as an oyster card on

137
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,919
steroids you can use it to pay for

138
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,440
public transport

139
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,840
vending machines and even in stores

140
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,639
pasmo's

141
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,800
um based on the uh sony for seller

142
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,280
system seller is a form of rfd

143
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,240
therefore plasmas have a special rfc rfi

144
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:50,720
and

145
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,280
ic and a nutella and built into them

146
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:53,759
which

147
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,600
allows for a fast transaction of about

148
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,080
10th of a second

149
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,160
unlike credit cards it also has quite a

150
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,759
large range which helps with fast and

151
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,720
efficient

152
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,759
payments which are normally quite common

153
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,080
with the use of high volume payments

154
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,440
being made in train stations

155
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,520
for example but with every positive

156
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,880
there must be a negative

157
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,479
which is the long distance it makes it

158
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,000
easier for drive by skimming

159
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,120
and unlike a credit card the

160
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,120
transactions are rarely recorded

161
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,320
so this means the yakuza i

162
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,759
could just place rfd uh skimming

163
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,199
components on vending machines for

164
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,919
example you know in the back alley

165
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,199
now the system is certified

166
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,440
for other uses in phones but it doesn't

167
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,639
mean it's

168
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,720
you know safe enough to prevent drive by

169
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,160
skimming that's what's happened to han

170
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,520
as he walks down the platform

171
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,320
so now he's about 500 yen short which is

172
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,360
the cost of a trip back home

173
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,280
hand joins the line for one of his

174
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,120
carriages

175
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,199
as the train pulls up anyone take the

176
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,560
tube recently i know we've covered it's

177
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,160
unlikely but

178
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,520
i'd like everyone just to do something

179
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,199
very quickly for me imagine you're on

180
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,080
the tube

181
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,680
it's rush hour and it's turning the

182
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,280
train stops

183
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,000
what are you gonna do well eventually

184
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,120
you're going to get out

185
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,080
and walk to the next platform now that's

186
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,639
not really

187
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,240
much of a biggie but now imagine your

188
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,080
carriage is four times fuller and the

189
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,600
train stops

190
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,880
now we're looking at something much

191
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,280
bigger

192
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,440
so how would someone do that though well

193
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,039
a power cut or ransomware

194
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,960
is actually quite an obvious and has

195
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,840
this quite a clear impact

196
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,919
so what are the hackers doing this time

197
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,240
to mess with hand

198
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,560
well they have been as successful as

199
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,000
they planned they've caused a fire to

200
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,560
outbreak

201
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,720
at the next station as they were messing

202
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,000
with the station gates

203
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,280
and one of them overheated not much of a

204
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,160
big

205
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,800
big problem surely well i've seen the

206
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,720
effects of a single fire on the metro

207
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,800
when free past colleagues of mine were

208
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,919
three hours late

209
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,560
but that's not a major issue the issue

210
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,400
was a quarter of the metro was shut that

211
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:58,880
day

212
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,120
to put that numbers we can use wimbledon

213
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,160
being

214
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,880
the oldest uh oldest tennis tournament

215
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,680
in the world

216
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,120
and shinjuku being the busiest train

217
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,360
station in the world shinjuku

218
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,080
is estimated to have around about 3.5

219
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,800
million people

220
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,039
go for it daily so let's say a quarter

221
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,039
of that used quarter of the metro

222
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,720
that's about 875 000 people

223
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,199
so that's nearly a million individuals

224
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,720
which is about double the number of

225
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,319
people that went to wimbledon last year

226
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,880
luckily hank can get to work after the

227
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,520
disaster of the morning he's had

228
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,720
but now han has just

229
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,440
got off work for lunch so he walks into

230
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,360
7-eleven and grabs some lunch

231
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,360
before heading back to work so why am i

232
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,520
talking about a convenience store

233
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,840
in the middle of a cyber security talk

234
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,680
well unlike tesco's and sainsbury's

235
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,440
7-elevens are a really important place

236
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:51,759
for

237
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,000
people in japan and it is a good example

238
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,360
of how japanese companies view

239
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,120
cybersecurity

240
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,879
for example july last year 711's payment

241
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,199
payment service uh mobile payment

242
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,520
service let me create myself there

243
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,199
um was hacked a total of 55 million was

244
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,879
lost which is about 400

245
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,919
over four hundred thousand pounds but

246
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:14,960
when peop

247
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,960
seven pay codes president was asked why

248
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,800
seven pay didn't include two factor

249
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,479
authentication for its service

250
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,319
he was reported to repeat the phase two

251
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,120
factor what and this isn't the first

252
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,400
time someone said something like that

253
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,360
now it's 10 p.m hands walking to the

254
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,640
metro after a meal out with some

255
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,599
colleagues

256
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,000
but to get to the station he must cross

257
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,839
the shibuya crossing which is said to be

258
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,679
the busiest crossing in the world

259
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,800
with up to 3 000 people crossing in all

260
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,920
directions

261
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,560
at a time now hands standing outside the

262
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,040
road

263
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,959
as cars fly by the crowd keeps growing

264
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,480
and the cars keep

265
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,240
growing to go drive driving by

266
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,240
another five minutes passed and the

267
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,680
lights still haven't changed

268
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,360
and now there's around about 3 000

269
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,600
people waiting for the lights to change

270
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,000
suddenly the green man appears and like

271
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,839
a mo a basket of marbles have been

272
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,279
spilled people just

273
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,279
run across the road but certainly the

274
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,920
lights go back to red

275
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,839
so then there's still a large large

276
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,360
number of people on the side of the

277
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,240
pavement

278
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,920
now this might give people a flashback

279
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,360
of the italian job

280
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,640
where it's quite clear someone is

281
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,640
messing with the traffic lights but with

282
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,000
so many people

283
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,839
filling up the pavements there's an

284
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,240
actual issue of people being pushed into

285
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,440
the road

286
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,880
and as people don't cross the road

287
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,480
without the green man in japan

288
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,560
no cars are expecting anyone to be in

289
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,640
the road

290
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,839
eventually han does cross the road

291
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,279
he reaches and he reaches the

292
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,320
the platform to get to a train to

293
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,040
shinjuku

294
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,080
where he must change lines to get home

295
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,480
unlike the tube here tokyo metro is

296
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,120
owned

297
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,600
by multiple companies so it's normal to

298
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,200
go for about six gates when go when

299
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,959
using multiple lines

300
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,560
hand reaches the gate and swipes his

301
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,079
card to go through

302
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,640
but it doesn't open he steps back and

303
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,920
swipes again

304
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,839
the gates don't open but now has two

305
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,200
people waiting behind him

306
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,600
he swipes again and again until a fifth

307
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,680
time bing the gates open

308
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,680
and he walks through but now he's left

309
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,680
five other people behind him

310
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,160
the next individual swipes a card and it

311
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,200
happens again

312
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,560
so what's actually happened

313
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,680
well the hackers have been messing with

314
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,440
hans day have increased the time it

315
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,959
takes for the gates to open to 10

316
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:35,920
seconds

317
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,600
so instead of every two seconds someone

318
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,360
going through

319
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,880
someone else has joined the queue for

320
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,200
the gates so with shinjuku being the

321
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,880
busiest train station in the world

322
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,480
we're talking about 900 000 passengers

323
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,399
per rush hour

324
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,839
so with there being 200 gates

325
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,000
there should be 200 people going in or

326
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,120
out of the gates in two seconds

327
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,880
so normally in 10 seconds there should

328
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,320
be about a thousand people

329
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,160
possibly going through in or out the

330
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,360
gates

331
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,519
but when the gates have been changed to

332
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,800
10 seconds

333
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,480
to allow people to go through it goes

334
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,040
back down to 200.

335
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,640
now that's not count and we're not

336
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,160
encountering the people coming into the

337
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,200
station

338
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,240
by trip through the other lines so in a

339
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,440
matter of minutes

340
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,320
shinjuku could be a solid mass of people

341
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,839
now let's take a note from jade

342
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,079
calls uh zero call and suddenly turn on

343
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,959
the fire sprinklers

344
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,920
so let's just do a quick comparison uh

345
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,200
of shinjuku

346
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,079
and britain's busiest and largest train

347
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,839
station waterloo station

348
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,360
waterloo is estimated to have 100.3

349
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,760
billion no not billion million

350
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,000
passengers per year going through it but

351
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,600
shinjuku is estimated to have 1260

352
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,639
million people

353
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,800
going through it per year that's 12

354
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,240
times more

355
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,320
now we could have hundreds if not

356
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,000
thousands of people

357
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,360
all stampeding trying to escape

358
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,399
just imagine it now

359
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,240
han does eventually get home and he's so

360
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,440
exhausted

361
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,560
he collapses on his bed and falls asleep

362
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,440
then he's rudely awakened at 4am by his

363
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:15,920
phone

364
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,959
screaming out earthquake alert

365
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,959
so he rolls out of bed he throws himself

366
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,800
under the table

367
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,440
30 minutes past nothing's happened and

368
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,200
this isn't the first time

369
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,040
something like this has happened dallas

370
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,480
is 150

371
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,680
60 emergency sirens were hacked in 2017

372
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,279
and were turned on and off multiple

373
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,240
times for over an hour

374
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,920
my hand is so exhausted he falls asleep

375
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,519
under the table until he's suddenly

376
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,519
awoken again but this time he's

377
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,360
surrounded by water

378
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,440
tokyo is flooded but how well dams

379
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,279
to be honest when someone talks about

380
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,120
dams most people think of america or

381
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,000
china

382
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,279
but never japan currently japan is

383
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,639
actually the fourth country with the

384
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,880
highest number of dams in the world

385
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,360
with china and us being first and second

386
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,839
but why is japan fourth

387
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,120
because well because parts of tokyo

388
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,519
and japan are known for flooding and

389
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,920
japanese just like building dams

390
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,639
tokyo is so famous for flooding that it

391
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,040
has its own flood system

392
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,320
this kind of threat may not seem

393
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,320
realistic but with the old catching up

394
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,120
the new

395
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,680
things are being put at risk like dams

396
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,959
now as i said

397
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,880
tokyo has its own flood system surely

398
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,399
that mitigates the risk of

399
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,639
dams being hacked and causing selling

400
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,800
flooding uh sudden flooding

401
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,040
well what happens if there's a particle

402
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,880
someone hacks the system

403
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,880
as seen in guy marston's tv show our guy

404
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,279
in japan the os the japanese are using

405
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,480
is as old as dinosaurs so imagine the

406
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,839
damage that could be done if all the

407
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:50,959
dams were hacked

408
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,880
and the flood system didn't work of

409
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,560
course this would only work if

410
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,160
the dams were full so

411
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,199
what is the hacker scene like in japan

412
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,880
it does exist but it's still young and

413
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,560
small compared to other countries

414
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,519
this is because it is hard to find

415
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,240
resources

416
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,360
in japanese to find

417
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,680
the advice on how to teach people how to

418
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,880
hack

419
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,000
so how does the scene grow though well

420
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,399
bulletin boards and underground markets

421
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,480
bulletin boards play quite a large role

422
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:22,720
in

423
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,720
the development of japanese hackers and

424
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,160
cyber criminals

425
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,920
a famous case of this is when the demon

426
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,600
killer hacker spread malware in the

427
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,519
forum 2 channel

428
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,680
to infiltrate and gain access to uses

429
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,360
computers in 2012

430
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,079
he was eventually arrested in 2013 for

431
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,399
making a death wrap

432
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,639
in terms of the japanese underground

433
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,320
markets you can guess what you can find

434
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,279
there guns

435
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,920
fake passports stolen credentials etc

436
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,760
but also hacking advice

437
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,760
want to destroy your enemies exploit

438
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,600
money rule the world where the japanese

439
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,519
underground houses it all

440
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,000
so let's so that makes sense for the

441
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,480
uq's eye to utilize these gold mines

442
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,839
there's even been evidence of the

443
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,000
accuser sponsoring cyber criminals

444
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,320
in other countries like russia as in the

445
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,160
atm cases in 2016

446
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,480
case there was a belief that hackers

447
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,600
outside japan

448
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,560
were involved so what is the state of

449
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,279
japanese cyber security

450
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,560
well it's doomed in my opinion but why

451
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,279
do you ask

452
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,360
because japan is entering a stage of its

453
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,320
history

454
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,600
where the old way of life like the

455
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,759
bushido code and job for life is

456
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:30,639
disappearing

457
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,040
which is leaving a hole in society

458
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,040
especially with the young japanese

459
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,720
so let's talk about some examples of

460
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,519
this loss of loyalty in the form of

461
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,279
insider threats like the case of a

462
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,040
ex-employee of an information equipment

463
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,839
cycling

464
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,839
uh company being arrested due to their

465
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,920
stealing and selling hard drives that

466
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,519
contain personal data

467
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,839
in the form of tax records another

468
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,600
example is companies not being honorable

469
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,000
by not

470
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,639
reporting data leaks for months although

471
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,160
to give credit

472
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,000
this is also due to their culture of

473
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,920
victim shame

474
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,600
so as the king one of the kings of

475
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,199
technology

476
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,959
japan seems quite relaxed the cyber

477
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,040
threats that threaten its economy

478
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,120
as this cabin is seen in the statistic

479
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,079
of 84

480
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,160
of the japanese adult population

481
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,759
believing cyber threats are a likely

482
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:16,480
risk

483
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,399
but corporations only putting in basic

484
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,399
counter measures as can be seen in a

485
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,519
recent survey of 1794

486
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,680
japanese companies where roughly 90 of

487
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,360
the respondents said

488
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,079
their cyber defenses were insignificant

489
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,120
so with that with

490
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,880
with there being a lack of general

491
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,800
education of cyberspace and cyber

492
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,560
threats on top of all of that

493
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,279
has led to a weak cyberspace this also

494
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,480
explains why a recent

495
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,519
a 2020 global rating of cyber

496
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,839
capabilities by harvard university

497
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,480
ranked japan as ninth with the us china

498
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,800
and britain being the top three

499
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,600
it also they also ranked japan being the

500
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,399
12th

501
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,000
20th in the capability of monitoring

502
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,160
possible attacks which is a big concern

503
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,199
especially with the recent

504
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,040
reconnaissance being done by russia

505
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,079
against japan

506
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,039
around the olympics

507
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,079
william sato an excellent special cyber

508
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,439
security adviser for their prime

509
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:12,959
minister their former prime minister at

510
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,079
the time

511
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,000
once pointed out one of uh that there

512
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,919
are too many japanese

513
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,480
uh people being unwilling victims in

514
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,160
cyber crime

515
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,760
as they are inserting unknown usbs

516
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,600
into entered devices and clicking on

517
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,520
dangerous links so look at that from the

518
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,600
uk viewpoint where learning basic cyber

519
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,120
hygiene like not clicking your dodgy

520
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:35,679
links is

521
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,240
taught secondary school but in japan

522
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,919
it's near and non-existent

523
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,760
attached out to an aging population and

524
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,600
you get a beginning of a recipe

525
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,480
for disaster and from an ocean viewpoint

526
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,160
it's one of the easiest target uh

527
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,640
countries to target there's a lack of

528
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,440
importance of

529
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,600
keeping sensitive data safe and it's

530
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,039
normal to document everything with

531
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,640
photos

532
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,280
so to sum this all up in the set to sum

533
00:17:59,280 --> 00:17:59,679
it all

534
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,160
up in the saying water and safety are

535
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,080
free because of their viewpoint of

536
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,520
japan of cyber security is just on japan

537
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,400
and also due to their isolated nation uh

538
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,240
isolated

539
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,520
ireland nation state mentality

540
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,120
to reflect how serious this is the

541
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,840
japanese cyber security minister in 2018

542
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,320
admitted that he never used a computer

543
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,280
and if that's not

544
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,880
enough the fact that the minister was

545
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,320
also confused

546
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,440
when asked about if usbs were in use

547
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,240
at japanese nuclear facilities all i can

548
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,240
say about that is stugnet

549
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,360
so what can japan do as much as cyber

550
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,720
security may seem like a bit

551
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,400
like tatashe castle where you end up

552
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,320
running around in circles

553
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,760
before landing flat on your face

554
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,039
well never fear the uk's here the sport

555
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,240
there's a small light at the end of the

556
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,840
tunnel for japan

557
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,080
uk cyber security companies are slowly

558
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,360
starting to help japan

559
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,919
like ncc and ncd but why are they only

560
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,720
starting now

561
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,320
well in 2013 when tokyo 2020 was

562
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,760
announced the uk government offered

563
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,480
their help

564
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,480
to improve the national level of cyber

565
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,679
security in japan

566
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,679
but the offer was turned down until

567
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,120
around about last year

568
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,640
where they turned around and went oh no

569
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,039
we need your help but that's not enough

570
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,640
there's a massive demand for cyber

571
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,400
security professionals in japan

572
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,160
even bigger demand than the uk and

573
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,480
america so what can japan do in the

574
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,480
ever-growing face

575
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,120
of cyber security threats before they

576
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,600
get run over by them

577
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,000
in my opinion japan should take on the

578
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,360
uk's national model

579
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,880
and they start to do that they've now

580
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,640
got a national center of red

581
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,240
instant readiness and strategy for cyber

582
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,400
security they've also set up a

583
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,960
cyber security council as part of their

584
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,880
basic act on cyber security

585
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,120
the purpose of the council is to enhance

586
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,720
the information sharing between members

587
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,640
of the council and to help promote

588
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,559
cyber security the japanese also do

589
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,320
take part in cyber awareness month

590
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,760
anyone who follows my twitter may have

591
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,320
seen my lovely 2018 awareness poster

592
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,120
but that's not enough as a uk assistant

593
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,799
and student i'm used to seeing adverts

594
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,200
posters leaflets etc talking about basic

595
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,799
height cyber hygiene like two-factor

596
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:09,200
face

597
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,200
authentication in the uk but it's hard

598
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,679
to find in japan

599
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,559
now there are some universities that are

600
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:17,360
offering

601
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,840
basic level of cyber security courses

602
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,080
and the ministry of internal affairs and

603
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:22,960
communications

604
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,919
launched a national training center in

605
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,919
2017 with the intent of annually

606
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:28,720
training

607
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,240
a hundred engineers under the age 25

608
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,280
for 2020.

609
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,039
but if they kept to that goal that meant

610
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,039
they trained 300 engineers

611
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,280
just for this year in comparison that's

612
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,039
nearly as many people graduating

613
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,080
from my course from my uni

614
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,039
in three years there's also the fact

615
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,159
that their general

616
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,520
red teaming knowledge as uh from a

617
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,360
from a domestic and national level is

618
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,679
lacking compared to the uk and america

619
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,720
to sum it up japan is quite behind in

620
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,480
terms of domestic its domestic and

621
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,480
national level of cyber security

622
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,760
so how do i know this well when i first

623
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,120
took my first step into

624
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,919
my cyber security career i was given two

625
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:12,720
tickets

626
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,360
the first ticket was a ticket into the

627
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,480
uk so

628
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,960
uk infosec scene which is amazing filled

629
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,880
with amazing individuals and groups

630
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,280
but it's already quite oversaturated i

631
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,960
would just be another tadpole in the

632
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,840
ocean

633
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,000
but what about that second ticket that

634
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,080
second ticket was a flight to japan and

635
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,600
a gateway into the japanese infosec

636
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,200
scene

637
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,720
so what is the ultimate message from

638
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,960
this talk well as a young man with so

639
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,480
much to say with so little time in an

640
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,320
nda on top of his head

641
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,480
i'm asking for someone else in this room

642
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,480
to have a look at this amazing country

643
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,039
that is a major contribution to our

644
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:47,840
technology

645
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,000
that we live and breathe and for them to

646
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,200
say

647
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,880
maybe i'd like that second ticket to

648
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,400
thank you very much arigatou gozaimasu

649
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,480
thank you to all the everyone beer

650
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,720
farmers mentors

651
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,159
and thank you for listening that is also

652
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,720
a key thing

653
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,679
ben that was awesome um absolutely

654
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,440
brilliant um

655
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,679
loved it loved the storytelling element

656
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:16,880
so you're actually telling the story

657
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,080
rather than just dumping

658
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,120
here's all this cool stuff um

659
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,080
that's cool but this is awesome um we

660
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,520
have got a couple of questions from the

661
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,240
audience

662
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,440
um first up dan khan

663
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,240
said as japanese cyber security doesn't

664
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,400
appear to be taken seriously

665
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,240
could this have a serious effect on

666
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,240
their tech companies going forward

667
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,320
as people from other companies get more

668
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,640
security conscious

669
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,760
uh yes it's my biggest risk and one of

670
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,360
the reasons why i wanted to do this talk

671
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:47,679
is

672
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,600
actually a lot of people don't realize

673
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,760
as i said about technology being a big

674
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,520
part of what we use now

675
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,600
as cyber security engineers and

676
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,640
professionals

677
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,559
and just to the general population in

678
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,960
the world japanese technology is

679
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,240
a key part and with them with

680
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,559
some of the domestic level stuff in

681
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,799
japan being very

682
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,640
we don't need cyber security is an

683
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,039
expense not a necessity

684
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,520
it's i see it as a risk to not just the

685
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,280
japanese population but to the rest of

686
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,200
the world

687
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,640
in terms of you know all it takes and

688
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,679
i i've used an example i saw a tweet

689
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,919
about a facial mask which could

690
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,679
translate it was for covered

691
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,840
and someone said oh great you know we

692
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,280
could use that we could hack that and

693
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:33,760
i'm like

694
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,080
yeah that is actually probably quite

695
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,440
possible because they're not going to

696
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,799
think about it they're looking for the

697
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,039
usability

698
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,080
so that's my answer to that

699
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,039
cool up next we have one of the beer

700
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:47,919
farmers

701
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,960
very own ian

702
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,320
thornton trump you had a question i

703
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,919
did so really really interesting um

704
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,320
uh really interesting talk and you know

705
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:00,960
it was

706
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,240
about what is it two or three weeks ago

707
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,320
i believe the japanese had demonstrated

708
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,559
a i think it was a 50 or 60 foot

709
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:16,159
robot um i have concerns that perhaps

710
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:17,760
this robot does not have as

711
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,799
robust cyber security um

712
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,440
as it should the japanese seem to be

713
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,799
pushing the envelope

714
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,240
in terms of technology um so

715
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,200
so my question to you is is that you

716
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,000
know

717
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,559
is the attack surface of japan um

718
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,520
so large as a result of sort of all of

719
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,000
the

720
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,200
innovative and sort of um future

721
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,840
um tech that they're experimenting with

722
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,200
uh yes straight away yes

723
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,720
it goes back to actually what i was

724
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,240
saying about dan's question

725
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,279
it it's a massive surface and i think

726
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,679
it will tie back a lot to what will

727
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,039
happen to the rest of the world

728
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,080
in terms of i i'll tell you now i love

729
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,320
the japanese toilets the fancy

730
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,159
multiple button ones i'd love one in the

731
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,600
uk and

732
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,279
i think everyone should have one them

733
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,799
raising but

734
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,279
if that did happen what is the risk of

735
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,120
someone just hacking that

736
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,559
and i actually generally want to do this

737
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,080
when i get out to japan i'm thinking

738
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:20,960
about

739
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,400
looking to do a little project to see if

740
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,080
i could hack a toilet i know it sounds

741
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,039
silly

742
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,640
but that is the silly thing they are

743
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,320
producing technology that

744
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,919
a lot of the uk and a lot of the rest of

745
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,000
the world don't think of

746
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,960
and don't do and that is why i'm very

747
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,559
concerned about their attack surface in

748
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:37,200
terms of

749
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,720
when the technology will come out and

750
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,320
we're going wow that's amazing

751
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,799
and we bring that into our countries and

752
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,880
the rest of the world takes it in

753
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,039
is that just bringing another extra part

754
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,640
to our attack surface as well

755
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,840
and can we prepare now and help

756
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,559
japan sort that out before it gets to us

757
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,400
so just on the back of that that's a

758
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,240
great answer i am

759
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,159
i remember watching earlier this year or

760
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,760
back in the last year i remember james

761
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,159
may

762
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,480
the uh the top gear and grand tour guy

763
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,400
did a tour of japan

764
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,120
and it was super fascinating stuff but

765
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,520
in one scene he went to um

766
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,640
a superman an electronics supermarket

767
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,159
and there were things in there that you

768
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,360
would never have thought there was an

769
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,880
application for

770
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,279
and just gadgets and this and the other

771
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,640
and all i did throughout that entire

772
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,600
section was go

773
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,440
that's hackable yep that's hackable

774
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,880
that's hackable and that was it that's

775
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,320
that's the only takeaway i got from it

776
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,120
was that the

777
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,840
proliferation of technology and um is

778
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,279
making the problem it's compounding the

779
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:35,760
problem

780
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,240
and kazuki made a point in in the twitch

781
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:38,960
there about

782
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,840
um convenience being the driver so when

783
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,159
japan produces technology

784
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,360
um it's with convenience and usability

785
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,200
for thought and obviously when that

786
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,120
happens security takes a back seat and

787
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,400
that's the problem that you've described

788
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,760
in your talk so well

789
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,039
so yeah interesting really interesting

790
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,760
to add to that that is why i the tokyo

791
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,360
is known as the city of convenience it

792
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,440
is designed to be convenient

793
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,720
i've been in those stores they're

794
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,440
amazing i love them but it is concerning

795
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,360
when you walk in and you go yeah oh

796
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,840
you know i wonder if i could hack that i

797
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,120
wonder if i bought that i brought that

798
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,400
back to the uk

799
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,320
and let a load of uni students just play

800
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,679
with it

801
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,520
what would happen and that is my biggest

802
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,760
concern if if a uni student can

803
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,039
do something with it what can lazarus do

804
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,480
with it what can

805
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,919
fancy bear do with it it's going from

806
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,440
one level to another you know i'm

807
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,880
looking at the low level and going well

808
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,399
what could the upper level do

809
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:35,600
and going from the upper level and going

810
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,559
what could the lower level do

811
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,480
so i have a i have a question that's

812
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,919
kind of coming from twitch

813
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,200
um toilet

814
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,440
somewhere lid won't open until you pay

815
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,360
or maybe it won't flush until you pay

816
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,120
what's your thoughts on that i just want

817
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,799
to get a general idea is that how you

818
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:55,360
would go or

819
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,440
what would you do when you oh i would

820
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,120
make it bite you

821
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,120
i'd i'd make it look like so i'll tell

822
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,640
you a little story so the first time i

823
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,919
ever saw one

824
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,000
i went up to i'd gone up north to go and

825
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,760
see there's no monkeys and i walked into

826
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,960
the cubicle

827
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,799
and i closed the door and turned around

828
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,240
and i can tell you now it's like a

829
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,600
horror story

830
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,960
slowly watching the lid go and i'm going

831
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,159
what is this monster

832
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,080
i would if i was going to do it i would

833
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,440
make it so that it would look like

834
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,640
you're about to go to the toilet should

835
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,840
sit down and it would just start

836
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,840
biting you and just everything just

837
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,120
explodes you know

838
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,440
get war now actually i'll tell you one

839
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,480
thing

840
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,080
which would i definitely do for the

841
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,760
gentleman in this room um

842
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,840
so for anyone who has not seen any of

843
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,240
these toilets there is a very fun

844
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,399
function for the ladies of the room as

845
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:43,520
let's put like this

846
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,600
which is allowed to help clean the front

847
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,679
end and the back end

848
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,360
now i have not tried the front end on

849
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,279
myself i'm not planning to

850
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,120
but i think i'd be very concerned if i

851
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,840
had a lot of quite warm water being shot

852
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,960
directly towards

853
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,080
very sensitive area for myself

854
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,720
so you can see the concern of i would i

855
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,840
would make sure you know

856
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,760
for them a little bit it's like it's

857
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,000
like treat it more like a trojan with a

858
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,320
ransomware on the back

859
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,240
well i've i've i alright so i have a

860
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,360
suggestion for you then

861
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,799
um you know when you're doing your whole

862
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,279
kind of toilet munching episode

863
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,399
right play baby shark that's all you

864
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:23,360
need to do

865
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,840
that will just that i will just die i

866
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,039
will end up in a

867
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,159
ball on the floor laughing um honestly

868
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:30,640
ben

869
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,200
that was absolutely fantastic i think

870
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:33,760
we've

871
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,919
wrapped up most of the questions and

872
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,279
we're going to stop before we end up

873
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:38,480
going down the route of a

874
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,000
toilet based hacks ransomware but um

875
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,520
i think that would be a ransomware i pay

876
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,360
though i think if i was desperate you

877
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,480
know that would be something

878
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,559
yeah 10 bitcoins yeah just take it i

879
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,559
need i need to use this toilet

880
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,760
um sean you've got a question yeah um

881
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,840
so we hear about ios not iot because

882
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,440
the s is for something else um

883
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,840
it just seems like japan is very much

884
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,559
into the

885
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,679
the how the whole iot stuff so

886
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,360
do you think we should move towards a uh

887
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,480
industry probably across nations

888
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,039
regulation and standardization of iot

889
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,399
devices

890
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,840
yes but there's actually quite an

891
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,080
interesting point about this so in

892
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,600
preparation for 2020

893
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,440
the japanese government announced they

894
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,520
were going to hack every iot

895
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,000
possible i'm not joking they were going

896
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,600
to do it and they i believe they have

897
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,240
now

898
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,480
so they were looking to see you know did

899
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,480
someone leave the password as password

900
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,960
they were looking to break basically the

901
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,840
country to go

902
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,240
look we can we need to secure now the

903
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,440
issue is

904
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,600
is as much as you know you do that once

905
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,480
that's great

906
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,880
but people buy more iots and i think

907
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,679
yeah

908
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,799
if we came up with a regulation which

909
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,080
would allow

910
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,200
you know to prevent things like you know

911
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:57,600
having

912
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,279
admin admin as your password and

913
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,200
username that would be wonderful

914
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,120
i think a lot of people agree with me on

915
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,840
that

916
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,360
