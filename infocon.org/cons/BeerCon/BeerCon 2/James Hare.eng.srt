1
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:05,600
welcome back everyone

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,120
um we are lined up next with james hare

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,800
and he's going to talk all about

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,160
patching something

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,559
many of us on the beer farmers are very

6
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:15,599
passionate about so

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,080
take it away james hi i'm james hair

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,960
and uh let's get this action started

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,199
here

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,240
all right so i've worked in information

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,160
technology for about 20 years

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,520
um i started uh in 1997

13
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,320
working as a help desk guy for a

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,719
regional internet service provider

15
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,520
and worked my way up through a number of

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,320
positions

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,200
i now work as a systems management

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:45,840
expert

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,600
um primarily doing government

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,879
contracting

21
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,879
uh with federal and state governments

22
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,239
here in the united states

23
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,840
um i've done some uh consulting

24
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,559
with private business primarily in

25
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,160
government at this point

26
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,840
um when i am not patching systems i

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,880
try to do a lot of snowboarding uh

28
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,520
and then in the off season i like to

29
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,400
bicycle hike

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,360
and camp and since we're talking about

31
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,159
beer i really love

32
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,400
beer my favorite beer is an american

33
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,200
beer called

34
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,799
hedy topper from a little brewery called

35
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,960
the alchemist you ever get a chance to

36
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,880
go to vermont great spot in

37
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,000
stowe vermont

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,280
just to start off a little bit of an

39
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,439
idea of why we patch um

40
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,479
so one of the bigger ones for me just

41
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,240
looking at it is uh the maersk line

42
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,600
incident in 2017 uh this is a

43
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,000
a ransomware incident where they got hit

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,560
with the noctua ransomware

45
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,560
um and that ransomware made use of the

46
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,640
eternal blue exploit that was a

47
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,680
wonderful invention of the nsa

48
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,600
that was uh was disclosed by the shadow

49
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,320
brokers around march 2017 it was written

50
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,880
immediately patched by microsoft uh but

51
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,920
then even in june

52
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,320
2017 three months later we see it being

53
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,399
successfully exploited to cause over 300

54
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,000
million in losses

55
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,919
um it took down mayor's shipping i think

56
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,200
for two or three different two or three

57
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:11,920
days

58
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,599
so a very serious incident uh just last

59
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,160
year

60
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,120
uh baltimore city in maryland got hacked

61
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,120
with the exact same malware

62
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,680
exact same eternal blue uh exploit

63
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,840
uh the city ended up paying over 18

64
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,720
million dollars in remediation costs

65
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,680
and the the folks who who did the the

66
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,959
after-action audit

67
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,760
made it very clear that by not patching

68
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,519
their systems for over two years they

69
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:40,400
basically

70
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,599
left their door open to an attack by

71
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,200
just about anybody it didn't take a heck

72
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,200
of a lot of skill to use eternal blue

73
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,879
in may of 2019 to exploit a system

74
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,000
then finally we've had a real uptick in

75
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,680
ryuk ransomware attacks

76
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,760
in september and uh october of 2020.

77
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,840
uh one of the more recent ones here in

78
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,280
the united states was united health

79
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,120
services got hacked

80
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,959
uh they haven't really given a lot of

81
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,080
information but ryuk has previously used

82
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,319
uh ie and acrobat vulnerabilities that

83
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,239
were patched a very long time ago

84
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,800
so these incidents show that patching is

85
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,440
something that

86
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,000
that you know you got to do it you would

87
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,519
get caught with your pants down if you

88
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:22,319
don't

89
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,360
and when you open a support call with

90
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,799
just about any vendor one of the first

91
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:27,840
calls or

92
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,840
questions they're going to ask is are

93
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,280
you up to the current patch level so

94
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,560
it's something you need to pay attention

95
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:32,879
to

96
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,120
not just for these incidents but also

97
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,319
make your life easier if you need

98
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,720
support

99
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,760
the rate of vulnerabilities has been

100
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,680
increasing every single year

101
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,640
in 2017 there were six thousand four

102
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,200
hundred and

103
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,200
or sixteen there were six thousand four

104
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,120
hundred and forty seven cves

105
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,519
the next year the rate more than doubled

106
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:54,159
uh

107
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,799
and we've had steady increases each year

108
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,040
uh this year in october we already have

109
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,840
15

110
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,599
209 publicly disclosed cvs

111
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,200
so there's i i believe the number i read

112
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,400
two three years ago was

113
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,120
50 or more discovered a day obviously

114
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,840
that number has increased quite a bit

115
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,560
just looking in the windows world this

116
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,478
is the last three months

117
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,680
october 2020 cvv cbe

118
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,960
2020 16 898

119
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,680
this allows remote code execution just

120
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,880
by transmitting an

121
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,320
uh specially formed uh ibv6 packet

122
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,160
and that's present in every single

123
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,000
current release of windows 10

124
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,360
and windows server to uh 2019.

125
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,440
uh the 16 947 is an outlook bug

126
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,680
allowing for rce if you get a specially

127
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,840
crafted email

128
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,960
september 168.75

129
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,440
is an exchange flaw that allows for rce

130
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,880
with a now formed email i know a lot of

131
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,840
people aren't doing

132
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,440
uh their own exchange anymore thanks to

133
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,479
office 365 and other hosted services

134
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,240
but here we go if you've got if you're

135
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,639
hosting an email you might be

136
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,320
uh looking at this uh and then

137
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,199
uh 1210 is a sharepoint vulnerability

138
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:13,680
where

139
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,840
a uh specially crafted application

140
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,360
package could cause remote code

141
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,680
execution on your sharepoint server

142
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,880
and finally in august we had uh

143
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,160
20 1472 which was the zero login flaw

144
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,039
uh zero logon flaw which uh sounded

145
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,400
really interesting i haven't actually

146
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,280
seen any uh

147
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,039
information about it being exploited in

148
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,120
a while but you know another

149
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,800
issue where where authentication is

150
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,639
basically useless on a single

151
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,720
computer and finally uh this 2028

152
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,280
1380 is a flaw in internet explorer

153
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,720
which is still out there

154
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,120
still on every windows 10 computer and

155
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,120
this allows for rce when you

156
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,840
get to a uh it's a drive-by rc from any

157
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,360
web page

158
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,440
so the the it's not just that we have a

159
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,120
large number of vulnerabilities

160
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,280
they are very very serious allowing for

161
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,960
real code execution but

162
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,199
real serious problems especially when

163
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,080
chained

164
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,919
with a uh privilege escalation attack

165
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,800
uh you you can get a wormable uh malware

166
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,319
very easily with just a couple of these

167
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,039
vulnerabilities

168
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,120
so that's why we patch our systems

169
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,039
so the patch cycle at least as we do it

170
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,160
here uh

171
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,720
is really a three step process but each

172
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,199
step

173
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,080
is is going on continually the first

174
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,600
step is discovering where

175
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,840
we're identifying any new or old

176
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,919
vulnerabilities in our environment

177
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,600
we are assessing our inventory and

178
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,440
discussing our and discovering new

179
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,240
systems

180
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,000
and we're researching that inventory and

181
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,280
we're researching uh

182
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,280
what's out there uh patchwise to

183
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,840
determine what's needed to mitigate our

184
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,840
vulnerabilities

185
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,880
the second step is mitigating those

186
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,080
vulnerabilities

187
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,240
i think the most important part of this

188
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,280
step is actually

189
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,639
testing the patches before they're

190
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,960
deployed while microsoft and all the

191
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,720
other vendors make a real

192
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,960
honest effort to test every single thing

193
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,639
that's out there

194
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,160
your environment is going to be

195
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,919
different than their test environment

196
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,440
you may have custom line of business

197
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,360
applications they've never seen

198
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,880
so you need to make an effort to test

199
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,880
before you deploy to production

200
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,639
so you don't have issues cropping up

201
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,680
after patching because one of the

202
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,440
biggest issues i've run into

203
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,560
in getting systems patched on time is

204
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,160
business units requesting that

205
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,880
they'd not be patched at a certain time

206
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,319
because they're concerned that patching

207
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,759
is going to cause disruption

208
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,840
the only way that you can avoid that

209
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,960
issue

210
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,360
is to work with your people in ahead of

211
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,680
time so that they're not concerned about

212
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,800
patches causing issues

213
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,360
finally we need to report on how our

214
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,960
patching has gone we have to

215
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,639
verify that the mitigation steps have

216
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,879
gone properly but we also need to be

217
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,960
aware of how the process is gone so that

218
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,319
we can continually

219
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,639
improve our process we want to make sure

220
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,960
that we are delivering patches

221
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,120
as quickly as possible as accurately as

222
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,720
possible with as few

223
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,720
issues as possible and that means we are

224
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,840
continually looking

225
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,120
to improve our process going into a

226
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,400
little bit more detail about discovery

227
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,800
so in a perfect world every single

228
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,560
inventory record in your inventory

229
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,240
management system is going to link to a

230
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,319
specific user or business owner

231
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,879
um i have yet to work at any

232
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,479
organization where that's true for every

233
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,080
single asset

234
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,120
some do better than others but

235
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,520
for patching we need to know as much as

236
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,919
possible we want to know 99.999 or

237
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,479
whatever

238
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,880
so that we aren't running into systems

239
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,120
either road i.t assets or assets that

240
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,559
didn't get into our management system or

241
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,279
whatever

242
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,599
we want to make sure we know those so we

243
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,440
can use our existing data

244
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,880
uh you know we may have an active

245
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,399
directory implementation or other

246
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,000
directory implementation that gives us

247
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,959
data about

248
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,560
our our endpoints we may have antivirus

249
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,320
or other systems management tools that

250
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,680
will give us information about our

251
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,480
inventory

252
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,839
and then again we may have an inventory

253
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,160
management product

254
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,920
we want to make sure that all of those

255
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,440
existing data sources

256
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,360
agree on what's out in the uh in the

257
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,440
environment and we also want to make

258
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:09,920
sure

259
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,080
that all of those data sources are

260
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,080
updated as new assets come into the

261
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,440
environment

262
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,200
and then we also need to do active

263
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,760
discovery now in most cases whatever

264
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,440
management tool you're using

265
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,519
uh um maybe sccm uh titanium

266
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,880
hcl bigfix uh norton

267
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,480
there's so many different ones out there

268
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,839
that's one of the difficulties with this

269
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:32,720
talk

270
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,320
they're all going to have a similar

271
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,040
discovery process and that's going to be

272
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,760
usually some kind of pain sweep uh you

273
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,360
know

274
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,720
i use nmap a lot for discovery i've used

275
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,160
lansweeper

276
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,959
and and all the the commercial tools are

277
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,160
going to use a very similar

278
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,600
technique just pinging everything in the

279
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,160
network to try to detect systems

280
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,920
and then doing a little bit of detection

281
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,160
based on the response to try to detect

282
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,480
what an operating system is give you a

283
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,600
confidence

284
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,279
interval about that so that you can

285
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,440
determine what to do with any unmanaged

286
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,800
assets

287
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,240
the other thing we need to know is that

288
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,079
discovery is a constant process we're

289
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,320
not just doing it right before patching

290
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,079
we are continually discovering new

291
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,680
systems we're continually aware of

292
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,120
things in our environment

293
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,240
and we want to be sure that we're

294
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,920
communicating with other business units

295
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,920
who may be adding new pcs

296
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,320
who may be bringing on a new office so

297
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,760
that we're aware of those changes so

298
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,200
that we can be prepared to patch them

299
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,680
properly

300
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,040
so when we're doing our research the

301
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,800
first thing we have to do is have an

302
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,160
up-to-date patching status of the

303
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,600
systems in our environment

304
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,200
it's not as important these days with

305
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,880
windows 10 because microsoft now

306
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,560
delivers all of their patches in a

307
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,839
cumulative package

308
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,279
but we still need to know what's out

309
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,800
there we still need to know the patching

310
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,240
status and we need to know

311
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,000
especially with those cumulative updates

312
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,680
where we may have to deliver a one

313
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,680
gigabyte or larger update to a large

314
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,760
number of pcs

315
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,000
uh we may be engaged in vulnerability

316
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,279
scanning if you've got something like

317
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,320
tenable nessus

318
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,519
uh that information can also inform the

319
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,040
patching process

320
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,120
uh one thing i've run into in in some of

321
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,040
my engagements has been that

322
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,440
you may not necessarily be able to trust

323
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,040
your patch management

324
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,160
uh product entirely because it may not

325
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,839
be aware of all the dependencies

326
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,320
involved with a specific vulnerability

327
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,519
so you may find from a vulnerability

328
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,399
scanning

329
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,519
program that you do have an issue that

330
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,200
your patch management program

331
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,399
isn't actually uh identifying so we want

332
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,839
to make sure we're using all of our

333
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,279
inputs

334
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,120
we need to make sure that any remedial

335
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,640
patching is addressed as soon as

336
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,680
possible

337
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,760
those are your biggest problems you know

338
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,240
if we looked at the the baltimore city

339
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,480
a real remedial patching program might

340
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,480
have saved them from that issue

341
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,320
we need to remember that microsoft is

342
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,480
not the only source of vulnerability or

343
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,079
patching needs

344
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,200
uh adobe and google both release patches

345
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,560
uh on patch tuesday uh google chrome

346
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,760
very often uh has security bugs beyond

347
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,079
just

348
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,279
including adobe flash uh adobe flash

349
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,959
thankfully will be going away as of

350
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,240
uh december but um that's something we

351
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,240
you may need to actually keep in mind

352
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,320
that there are some users who may have

353
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,839
applications that still use

354
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,079
flash that have not been updated to

355
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,600
remove that flash component so another

356
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,120
thing you need to be aware of

357
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,639
while you are researching what's out

358
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,560
there is where you may

359
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,120
have to exclude systems from patching

360
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,240
where you may have to

361
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,760
to kind of apply a light glove

362
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,880
on on very important users or developers

363
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,560
who may need their systems in a very

364
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,320
stable condition so they don't run into

365
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,399
issues with their applications

366
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,680
and that's what we get to where it's

367
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,160
it's not just about what patches need to

368
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,200
be deployed

369
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,040
we need to know what business units need

370
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,399
a little bit extra

371
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,399
care when we're deploying patches we

372
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,240
need to know maintenance windows

373
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,880
we need to know uh practices in

374
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,639
individual business units if there's a

375
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,800
business unit where they tell everybody

376
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,200
turn off your computer on friday when

377
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,480
you leave the office

378
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,000
that's something you need to be aware of

379
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,839
if you're sending a patch package

380
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,320
uh over to that system while they're

381
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,560
gonna be turning their systems off

382
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,880
so you need to engage not just with the

383
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,880
the software tools but also

384
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,600
with your personal communications tools

385
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,279
reaching out to stakeholders reaching

386
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,399
out to everybody who's

387
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,120
involved in in this patching process so

388
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,959
that they are aware of what's going on

389
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,320
and so they feel like they have some

390
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,560
ownership of it because otherwise

391
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,040
if anything goes wrong they're going to

392
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,800
point the finger at you first even if it

393
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,079
has nothing to do with patching

394
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,880
the next step is testing

395
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,399
as i said earlier i think testing is

396
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,000
probably the most important part of your

397
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,639
deployment

398
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,519
just from a standpoint of keeping uh the

399
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,160
the

400
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,600
uh audience involved so to do this we

401
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,720
need to be aware

402
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,680
of where we need to do extra testing as

403
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,880
i was saying earlier are there

404
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,000
developers or other super

405
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,440
users that require specific

406
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,600
configurations i know

407
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,920
in one of my engagements we had

408
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,519
developers who

409
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,760
needed to have a specific version of the

410
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,959
jdk

411
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,839
or they couldn't do their job and we had

412
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:16,560
to

413
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,959
kind of tiptoe around them because

414
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,040
normally we wanted to update the jdk to

415
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,360
the

416
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,360
most recent version and that involved

417
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,199
setting up exclusion groups

418
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,360
communicating them and knowing when and

419
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,120
where they might be ready for an upgrade

420
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,399
so that we were making sure we didn't

421
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,800
disrupt their development activities

422
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,560
uh you need to be aware of any critical

423
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,800
line of business applications

424
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,680
uh you know just a week and a half ago

425
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,720
at an engagement

426
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,920
i found out that we had passed a system

427
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,399
with

428
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,279
a very important uh i believe it was a

429
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,279
critical bug for sharepoint

430
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,519
but that critical patch had broken a

431
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:52,959
line of business application

432
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,199
on that sharepoint server and we had to

433
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,880
pull it back very quickly we didn't even

434
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,079
know we

435
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,920
had sharepoint on that server because we

436
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,199
hadn't engaged

437
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,120
in the kind of research and testing we

438
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,079
needed to so we ran into a problem

439
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,800
is there a standard system image for

440
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,000
your enterprise

441
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,680
in most cases there should be so you

442
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,519
should have that and be testing against

443
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,240
that

444
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,920
now if you're capturing an image from a

445
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,279
vm well

446
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,880
you should have a copy of that vm so

447
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,199
that you can test against it

448
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,959
we need to be prepared to test as soon

449
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,240
as possible uh

450
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,199
microsoft releases their their patches i

451
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,079
i think it's 10

452
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,120
a.m pacific time which isn't really the

453
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,040
most convenient time for a lot of folks

454
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,040
um some of the management tools require

455
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,800
a little bit of time between

456
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,480
the patch release and their actual uh

457
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,399
deployment of the patch in their system

458
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,680
and obtaining them and

459
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,040
bigfix at least need that um so you may

460
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,680
need to

461
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,240
actually use whatever automatic patch

462
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,199
capability

463
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,160
your patch program has in order to run

464
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,040
that test

465
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,959
if it's if those patches are being

466
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,040
released outside of your normal business

467
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,880
hours which you know i

468
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,120
i assume one one pacific is is not

469
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,880
normal business hours

470
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,079
in the uk and then finally when we are

471
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:09,600
testing we need to make sure that the

472
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,560
systems

473
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,959
that are used in testing are assigned to

474
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,800
users that we can trust

475
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,720
to make a report of a problem and to

476
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,800
actually make a useful problem report

477
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,880
they don't all have to be i.t workers

478
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,160
but we want to make sure we're working

479
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,519
with people who

480
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,959
will actually test everything they're

481
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,800
supposed to do and will get back to us

482
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,439
if it's an issue

483
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,839
and finally the mitigation steps after

484
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:34,959
we've made sure that we're

485
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,720
we're safe we want to deploy them to our

486
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,160
production systems as quickly as

487
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,360
possible

488
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,800
when we're doing that we need to

489
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,800
consider bandwidth usage both within

490
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,519
our wide area network of our offices and

491
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,440
external network bandwidth

492
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,120
most of your patch management systems

493
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,959
are going to end up downloading stuff

494
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,360
into a central store and distributing it

495
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,800
but if you've got a smaller branch

496
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,160
office that that

497
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,639
is served by a t1 link or or something

498
00:16:58,639 --> 00:16:59,920
even worse

499
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,600
you may need to consider that before you

500
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,279
do deployment to ensure

501
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,119
that there is a distribution point or

502
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,480
some kind of peer-to-peer patching

503
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,799
available at that location

504
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,039
we need to make sure that we communicate

505
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,119
to the users when patching is going to

506
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:13,599
occur

507
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,839
and what their responsibilities are we

508
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,439
need to let users know

509
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,480
we will be patching at this time please

510
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,400
log off save your work whatever you need

511
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,079
them to do if we're going to restart the

512
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,760
systems we need to let them know

513
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,839
because again the more we communicate

514
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,360
with the users the more we bring the

515
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,039
stakeholders into the process

516
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,720
the less problems we're going to have

517
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,640
down the line when

518
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,640
uh you know if we have an issue they're

519
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,000
ready to report it to us

520
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,760
and we're ready to work with them to fix

521
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,039
it

522
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,600
finally we need to work we once we've

523
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,120
done all of this patching

524
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,640
our endpoints should report back their

525
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,320
status and we should report that status

526
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,400
back to concerned business units

527
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,640
i know i've got a bunch of server

528
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,160
administrators that i send out a patch

529
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:54,640
and pat

530
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,640
uh status report every month they

531
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,080
probably never want read it but it's a

532
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,600
good way to make sure that they're aware

533
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,000
of what's

534
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,120
going on and and that everybody

535
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,160
is on the same page and then after we

536
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,919
finish our patching status report for

537
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:08,640
one month

538
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,520
that is our preliminary input into

539
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,039
discovery for the next month what

540
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,640
systems need to be patched

541
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,960
what their current patch status is and

542
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,760
then

543
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,840
you know where we're going as we move

544
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,240
forward

545
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,799
and so for process improvement this is

546
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,480
where we're looking at stuff like

547
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,640
if we've got a severe bottleneck where

548
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,960
we've got a business unit world where

549
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,400
all the systems are not receiving

550
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,559
patches in a timely manner

551
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,080
we need to research that talk to those

552
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,240
people uh either

553
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,160
make process or software changes to

554
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,679
support them to ensure that we're not

555
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:42,559
taking

556
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,840
a real long time to patch um if we have

557
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,600
business units with persistent patching

558
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,360
issues we need to speak to that those

559
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,360
business units and ensure that

560
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,840
uh their behavior is not causing those

561
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,520
issues as saying earlier you have some

562
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,640
instances

563
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,360
where uh even if you've communicated it

564
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,799
to everybody you may have an office

565
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,000
where people are told to turn the

566
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,440
computers off on friday night

567
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,960
and uh with this continuous

568
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,080
communication and

569
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,160
don't just warn users about patching we

570
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,679
need to be available for comments

571
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:14,640
afterwards

572
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,960
uh you need to be available not just for

573
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,480
comments about the patches but for

574
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,919
comments about the process so that

575
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:20,559
people feel

576
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,080
the door is open with the team and they

577
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,679
can work with you to make it work for

578
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:24,640
them

579
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,080
we need to follow up about special

580
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,320
requests if you've got developers very

581
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,200
important people

582
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,280
anything like that follow up with them

583
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,280
afterward to make sure whatever

584
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,400
software or process

585
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,760
changes you put in place actually worked

586
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,160
and you need to make sure as i said a

587
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,280
bunch of times

588
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,280
that all of our stakeholders are owners

589
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,480
of the process

590
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,080
because if the stakeholders are not

591
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,160
owners of the process

592
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,200
they will kick back and that's when you

593
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,640
end up having

594
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,400
one group that hasn't been patched for

595
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,400
six months and then all of a sudden

596
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,039
you're talking to the the security

597
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,120
incident manager about why that system

598
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,240
wasn't patched

599
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,760
and the real reason it wasn't patched

600
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,919
was because you hadn't built that trust

601
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,520
you hadn't gotten everybody involved in

602
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,760
the process and you weren't using

603
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,919
all the tools that are available to you

604
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,360
because one of the most important tools

605
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,200
available to us as information security

606
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,640
professionals

607
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,159
is communication we really do have to be

608
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,919
constantly communicating with the people

609
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,480
we're working with because otherwise

610
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,480
it's edicts from on high from folks they

611
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,760
don't know

612
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,120
instead of uh helpful suggestions from

613
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,200
colleagues they trust

614
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,480
so that's the basics

615
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,799
um if anybody's got questions i'll be

616
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,159
happy to answer them

617
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,720
i know this is a little bit conceptual

618
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,039
not as much talking about specific tools

619
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,640
that's mainly because i work with one

620
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,400
specific tool and i don't really want to

621
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,360
leave things

622
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,080
uh really really uh

623
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,240
tied to one tool i think the process is

624
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,559
the same regardless of what you're using

625
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,559
most of the tools offer the same basics

626
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,919
so uh really uh

627
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,200
any questions awesome talk james

628
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,960
um and you you spot on like to me

629
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,360
tools are only part of the thing a very

630
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,559
small part of the thing

631
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,919
in my opinion um it's the the culture

632
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,080
the process and all of that that forms

633
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,440
the biggest part of it

634
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,080
tools only just kind of fill in um in my

635
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,280
opinion

636
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,720
so there are yeah questions um the first

637
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,799
one about managing stuff that can't be

638
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:35,919
patched

639
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,280
um you know i've run into a couple of

640
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,080
instances

641
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,400
uh the first thing is making sure it's

642
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,240
properly documented just because that's

643
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,480
important from an auditing standpoint

644
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,559
um if you have a system that can't be

645
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,000
patched you need to have

646
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,679
every single exception in the world like

647
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,159
that completely documented

648
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,559
uh in line with whatever your internal

649
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,960
security procedures are

650
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,280
here in the states most of that stuff's

651
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,200
written by each company

652
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,039
so it depends a great deal

653
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,520
from a

654
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,840
software standpoint uh that is a device

655
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,280
that needs to be segregated from the

656
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,440
network as much as possible placed in a

657
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,679
a network segment where it can talk to

658
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,120
everything that it needs to and nothing

659
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,320
else

660
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,200
um and and the the other thing is to try

661
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,720
like heck to get rid of anything that

662
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,480
can't be patched because

663
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,799
uh that device is just waiting to be

664
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,520
made a zombie

665
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,320
and then with patch prioritizing um

666
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,919
again it's a little bit easier when

667
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,919
you're working in a in a government

668
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,520
space because uh the the i.t security

669
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,880
manager tells everybody what they're

670
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,000
gonna do

671
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,480
and they follow it so uh patching is the

672
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,559
priority that we want it to be

673
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,720
um we've had to fight sometimes to try

674
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,080
to get patches deployed a little bit

675
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,039
more quickly

676
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,960
but generally it's not a big deal of

677
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,760
getting uh everybody in line

678
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,280
um in private business

679
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,000
i found the easiest way to get other

680
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,039
business units

681
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,400
to accept the priority of patching

682
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,440
is really to force them to document any

683
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,840
exceptions from the patching policy

684
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,000
because if they want you to wait two

685
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,840
weeks well then they need to be the one

686
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,240
who

687
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,240
who uh demonstrates the business reason

688
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,880
and also the people who sign off on it

689
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,400
because in the end

690
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,440
then any any responsibility for

691
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,919
that decision to alter your patch pro

692
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:36,720
program

693
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,520
is on them not you because in the end

694
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,880
that's your only way you can really

695
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,720
cover your ass is making sure

696
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,559
that exceptions from security policy are

697
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,240
documented and

698
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,760
that somebody else signs that

699
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,200
documentation so it's not on your head

700
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,480
yeah i i totally agree so i did warn you

701
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,400
uh before we started i had a question um

702
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,919
so recently we we've seen

703
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,679
some articles i'm not going to go into

704
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,840
who or what

705
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,320
but there have been articles stating

706
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:08,880
that

707
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,279
maybe you shouldn't patch or at least

708
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,720
wait weeks

709
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,039
before you patch i think it's more from

710
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,120
a consumer point of view but i think

711
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,760
many can still read it in terms of a

712
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,679
certainly a smaller business

713
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,679
what are your thoughts on that um i mean

714
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,520
you've covered some topics but

715
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,240
what are your thoughts on those saying

716
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,960
that kind of thing

717
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,760
you know it's a challenging question um

718
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,559
working

719
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,640
in the government space there is

720
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,679
certainly

721
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,240
at least the perception that we are in a

722
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,400
much more active threat environment

723
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,400
um so there there is the impression that

724
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,720
things need to be out there quickly

725
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,039
um

726
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,600
you if you would ask me that question

727
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,760
this time last year i think

728
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,720
the answer would be a little bit

729
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,200
different uh because microsoft really

730
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:57,760
had some

731
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,200
some serious difficulties uh delivering

732
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,559
patches without

733
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,679
serious issues um basically from from

734
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,880
april till about august or or

735
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,640
september of last year um and

736
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,400
even with with very high level microsoft

737
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,279
support

738
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,200
um we were running into issues that that

739
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,559
were causing

740
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,640
significant problems in production i

741
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,400
remember one we had

742
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,760
uh over 1200 people who couldn't open

743
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,960
outlook because a patch had changed how

744
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,039
microsoft rendered uh a custom logo

745
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,240
in a password dialogue and that was

746
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,200
causing outlook to crash on us because

747
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,919
yeah a password dialogue should

748
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,440
definitely crash because an image

749
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,720
doesn't load properly

750
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,679
so um from a private business i don't

751
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,279
think there's really any security and

752
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:52,240
obscurity

753
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,400
um these guys who are sending out

754
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,919
phishing emails aren't really being

755
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:56,960
particularly

756
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,320
uh discriminate about it the

757
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,440
overall cost may be lower from a dollar

758
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,640
standpoint but it's still going to be

759
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,760
very disruptive

760
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,440
so as much as possible you should be

761
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,159
patching on

762
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,960
on the regular schedule that microsoft

763
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,240
is putting out

764
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,520
especially with with windows 10 because

765
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,919
uh if you patch each month you're you're

766
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,600
delivering a package that's about two

767
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,039
three hundred megabytes

768
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,640
uh if you patch a little bit

769
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,120
less uh then the deltas may not apply

770
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,480
and then you're delivering a cumulative

771
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,360
package

772
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,760
which for the 64-bit versions of of

773
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,200
windows 10

774
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,320
uh that can be i've seen some i believe

775
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,919
that we're over two gigabytes simply

776
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:40,720
because

777
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,039
you got every single dll for 32-bit

778
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,960
you've got every single dll for 64-bit

779
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,200
that's been updated since the original

780
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,360
uh release and with with some of the

781
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,320
like 1607 or or i think that's actually

782
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,360
eol

783
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,200
but like 1709 uh that's been out

784
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,600
in the wild for three years now so

785
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,960
that's three years of patches being

786
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,520
delivered in one huge package

787
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,720
so it's it really depends on your

788
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,720
organization but in almost all cases you

789
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,520
should be pushing

790
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,880
to get this stuff out as quickly as

791
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,799
possible yeah the

792
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,960
the way i view it is i'd much rather

793
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,080
have an issue

794
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,919
have full control over my data and

795
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:21,760
systems be able to roll back

796
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,520
versus something like travel x at the

797
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,520
beginning of the year you lost complete

798
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,640
control it's like a month

799
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,760
to try to regain control well microsoft

800
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,200
has made it challenging with delivering

801
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,799
everything in a single patch package for

802
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:33,679
windows i know

803
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,080
back in the past it was sometimes if you

804
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:36,799
had a

805
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,159
net package or something else that was

806
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,840
causing an issue you could hold that

807
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,679
back and that's not available anymore

808
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,520
but

809
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,200
it certainly is easier to manage so

810
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,799
it's trade-offs yeah um they're

811
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,279
really well put um yeah and i noticed

812
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,399
you just drawing do you

813
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,679
have anything to add or ask

814
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,440
i don't think it's really fair because i

815
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,679
did come in at sort of the cube part

816
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,799
of the questions as i was traveling

817
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,480
today on work and now i'm in

818
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,520
sunny ports uh hoax down

819
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,279
near bournemouth on the coast

820
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,880
okay um thank you james thanks for

821
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,600
a really informative talk um even to

822
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,440
someone like myself who's

823
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,440
knows how important patchiness but some

824
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,640
really good points on

825
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,960
um how to make patching better or the

826
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,679
process

827
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,120
of patching a lot more seamless and

828
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,159
less troubles arising so thank you

829
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:42,720
thank you for your time
