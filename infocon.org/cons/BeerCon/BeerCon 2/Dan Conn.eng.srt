a really cool guy he's going to talk

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,640
today about

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,760
opsec and social engineering so dan

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,800
welcome over to you thanks um

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,560
thanks for joining my first ever talk

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,000
thanks to the beer farmers for giving me

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,439
this opportunity as well

14
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,119
my name's dan khan i'm currently

15
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,960
studying a master's in advanced security

16
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,160
and digital forensics at edinburgh

17
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,120
napier

18
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,399
um and i've been coding for about eight

19
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,079
years and if you want to get in touch my

20
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,320
handles are on the slides there

21
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,480
so before i start i'm just gonna warn

22
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,440
you there's gonna be some strong

23
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,000
language

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,360
and we will be talking about things of

25
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,440
an adult nature such as coercive actions

26
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,399
under violence

27
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,559
and drugs and nightclubs so there aren't

28
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,079
any graphic images around that

29
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,399
but i just want you to understand that

30
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,760
you know sometimes you can get triggered

31
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,920
just by hearing some of this stuff so if

32
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,600
you feel it's unsuitable now is the time

33
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,320
to kind of

34
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,680
um do you know find something else um

35
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,760
okay so throughout studies there have

36
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,119
been points where i've kind of thought

37
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,400
wow you know i've been doing this my

38
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,119
whole life and

39
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,479
i've never really known there was a term

40
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,320
for it and two of those things have been

41
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:12,880
opsec

42
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,280
and social engineering two awesome

43
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,799
definitions are on the slides

44
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,040
and to paraphrase social engineering is

45
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,479
a means to obtain confidential

46
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,080
information about a project

47
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,799
and it could be protected by opsec opsec

48
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,560
is short for operation security

49
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,640
um an upset method to the steps taken to

50
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,400
ensure information remains confidential

51
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,759
and secure

52
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,040
so the way i like to think about them

53
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,119
both is you know they don't have to be

54
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,280
both present for for the other to work

55
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,799
but they certainly can use to counter

56
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,079
each other if they're both present

57
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,439
in a in an attack or defense so

58
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,960
this all sounds really pretty serious

59
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,040
right i mean why would i have been using

60
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,439
this

61
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,280
or even needing this growing up right

62
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,479
well here's a little story

63
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,399
let's go back to the 90s it was a time

64
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,320
of huge cabinet super clubs like cream

65
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,399
the hacienda the ministry of sound

66
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,399
where djs would play to filled arenas

67
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,320
it's a time of brick pop and indie dance

68
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,600
where the happy mondays

69
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,439
stone roses and oasis would be mad for

70
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,600
it in manchester while blurs swade and

71
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,119
elastico were pretending to be cockneys

72
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,080
down south

73
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,920
laden led that culture combined with

74
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,599
cool britannia was everywhere

75
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,200
and that and it was embraced rightly or

76
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,800
wrongly

77
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
and then there's little kid me and i'm

78
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,160
i'm at the moment missing out on all the

79
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,560
fun

80
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,239
i i used to read dictionary front to

81
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:23,920
back i used to read technical manuals

82
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,840
like novels absorb books on science and

83
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,800
history

84
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,120
but i loved it um now i'm not shattering

85
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,720
any illusions here i hope but let's be

86
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,560
honest you don't have pictures like this

87
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,920
if you weren't a little bit nerdy am i

88
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,120
right

89
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,360
however this little angelic nerd love

90
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,040
dance music he grew up with it he would

91
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,560
listen to it on the radio because wish

92
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,599
he was part of it

93
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,440
um imagine what a nightclub was it

94
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,440
sounded so much fun in his head

95
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,200
so i convinced myself i was going to be

96
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,120
a dj write music for a living

97
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,040
be part of this culture i've got some

98
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,720
really cheap record decks on my birthday

99
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,720
i learned piano i practiced loads

100
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,519
yeah let's go one slight snack you've

101
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,440
got to be 18 to be in these nightclubs

102
00:02:59,440 --> 00:02:59,760
and

103
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,200
although at this stage i'm a little bit

104
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,040
older than that photo

105
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,920
i'm only 12 or 13. so let's see how that

106
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,840
would have panned out right

107
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,680
excuse me can i come in i'm 18 i promise

108
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,480
not this decade son [ __ ] off and that

109
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,480
was the response i got from most places

110
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,480
i'm rightly so you know hearing this

111
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,319
from many places didn't deter me you

112
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,760
know as we all know when it comes to

113
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,480
attacks

114
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,879
you only need one weak link um just to

115
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:25,599
exploit

116
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,720
and you know eventually that was found

117
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,640
excuse me can i come in i'm 18 i promise

118
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,760
what's your star sign

119
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,720
aquarius yeah in indigo

120
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,519
the doorman let me in like now was this

121
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,440
a feat of social engineering mastery

122
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,280
like did i convince the target that my

123
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,959
squeaky voice and babyface

124
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,239
might have belonged to someone who was

125
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,439
18 or older no i'm pretty sure it wasn't

126
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,840
turns out in the 90s many pubs and clubs

127
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,840
really didn't care about ids or letting

128
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,280
in children to drink there there weren't

129
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,640
the hefty fines for certain

130
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,080
serving underage kids that there were

131
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,680
today all the health warnings

132
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,120
as long as you could confidently provide

133
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,280
a correct star sign not a date of birth

134
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,959
a star sign that never changes year to

135
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:09,599
year

136
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,560
uq could join in the fun yes and

137
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,920
wherever that i could i definitely

138
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,280
embraced that fun i kept flies as

139
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,079
mementos

140
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,600
that plastered my bedroom walls and i

141
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,279
still keep them to this day um you know

142
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,358
the first memories of kind of living a

143
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,120
semi-adult life and i absolutely loved

144
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,400
it

145
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,680
now this wasn't going to happen every

146
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,280
weekend right getting in at this young

147
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,000
age is very

148
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
much a trial and error process much like

149
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,840
many red team activities today

150
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,960
you know just because something worked

151
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,479
like last week doesn't mean it's going

152
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:35,520
to work today

153
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,120
yeah i had to use reconnaissance you

154
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,639
know what people were on the door that

155
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,320
night did they let me in last time

156
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,759
do they look like someone has annoyed

157
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,919
them tonight so are they going to let me

158
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:44,560
in today

159
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,919
you know reconnaissance has helped me

160
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,080
decide if an attempt was worth trying or

161
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,040
not

162
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,040
and even when you get into the place

163
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,320
after a period of time

164
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,479
you might get thrown out or barred more

165
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,320
because you've upset other patrons

166
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,520
and they're threatening to report the

167
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,280
public club you know if they didn't act

168
00:04:59,280 --> 00:04:59,680
so

169
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,360
this takes us to a first lesson of being

170
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,880
environment aware

171
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,960
i was fortunate enough that my godfather

172
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,080
was a pub landlord

173
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,400
so i'd grown up in pubs from near enough

174
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,360
birth and

175
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,120
was able to study how people acted in

176
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,440
them yo how do you ask for a point

177
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,360
how do you avoid getting barred most

178
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,120
important in this situation how are you

179
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,320
going to raise suspicion that you might

180
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,919
be underage

181
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,639
so looking sheepish in a corner eyes

182
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,080
looking up hunched over

183
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,680
you know sipping tim and beyond a pine

184
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,039
that's going to get thrown out after a

185
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,320
couple of weeks if you can't

186
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,800
then give id you know generally people

187
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,160
don't look like that if they should be

188
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,479
in

189
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,639
in there you know conversely you might

190
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,840
think being a bit cocky

191
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,960
you know a little bit arrogant might be

192
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,639
indicative of a young 18 year old but

193
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,080
everyone's going to think

194
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,000
you know they're a bit of a dick so you

195
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,600
know they're going to want id just they

196
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,680
can throw you out

197
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,840
you know just just as looking like

198
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,120
stereotypical hacker

199
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,800
probably will not get you into a

200
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,639
corporate building looking at a place in

201
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,120
a pub

202
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,120
is likely to get you thrown out too so

203
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,720
it's a social engineer whether that be

204
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,880
an office worker or a pub landlord

205
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,240
you need to look like you should be

206
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,680
there but your clothes don't look out of

207
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,039
place for the surroundings whatever that

208
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:03,680
is

209
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,199
and that you have confidence but not

210
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,280
arrogant so people take a dislike to you

211
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,720
don't set off people's internal

212
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,600
intrusion detection

213
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,360
so pubs and clubs are not the only

214
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,440
environmental awareness

215
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,800
the only place environmental awareness

216
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,639
can help an online use is with sock

217
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,440
accounts

218
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,360
there are some really good soccer counts

219
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,360
and many are harmless in jovial like

220
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,000
this one scoop magruder made by mclaren

221
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,919
scoot mcgrudy never breaks character and

222
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,600
he's even got photographic evidence that

223
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,440
he's real and scott mcgrady's brother

224
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,759
right seriously from this picture you

225
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,120
definitely think they were brothers and

226
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,400
that's because the best socks they

227
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,440
assimilate well

228
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,120
they have a good story and they never

229
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,600
break character

230
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,360
unlike this one andyo34945816

231
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,720
which try to arrest my friend lisa forte

232
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,720
they would dip in or something nice and

233
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,039
then start getting really nasty you know

234
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,880
as time passed it turned out they were a

235
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,479
terrible soccer count because they broke

236
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,960
character so many times

237
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,800
you know well to be fair they didn't

238
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,479
have much character to break which was

239
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,160
equally hilarious

240
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,599
so we thought we'd give them a bit more

241
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,120
depth their character by giving them a

242
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,400
more interesting story than their

243
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,759
creator could actually manage

244
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,080
we decided that andy was 48 he was an

245
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,880
accountant

246
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,400
he was happily married and he lived in

247
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,400
their home counties he hated commuting

248
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,599
who doesn't right

249
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,520
but we also gave him a proper name

250
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,400
instead of andyo34945816

251
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,080
we gave him the dignity of being called

252
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,000
andy numbers

253
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,400
and this slide explains the full story

254
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,039
let's digress a bit it is quite funny

255
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,880
we were so unimpressed with the

256
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,800
creator's lack of character we gave andy

257
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,400
numbers a credible story that was more

258
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,520
challenging to us

259
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,440
so all their creator had to do was make

260
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,639
notes go along with it

261
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,000
and he even screwed that up every bout

262
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,440
and asking this he would then delete all

263
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,039
of his history as if he would forget

264
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,400
everything that had taken place and we

265
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:48,879
would too

266
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,240
and that would never screenshot their

267
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,160
antics for things like this right

268
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,680
i guess they thought you know we would

269
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,360
have a bout of amnesia if they deleted

270
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,560
all their twitter history because that's

271
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,680
how it works you know a bit like

272
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,240
children

273
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,840
you know that hide on the premise that

274
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,280
if they can't see you then you can't see

275
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,800
them either

276
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,199
well anyway lisa suggested we should

277
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,400
play around with what

278
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,000
he had to say to see if he can remember

279
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,520
what he actually had written

280
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,240
in the past so we chose the name for his

281
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:12,720
wife

282
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,360
sarah and lisa persuaded andy number

283
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:15,840
that that

284
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,800
that was his wife's name we then changed

285
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,800
the css of the webpage and screenshotted

286
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,160
it to then call his wife helen and

287
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,800
that's what you see in the top right

288
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,560
then we waited uh the creator white's

289
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,080
all around his history

290
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,599
you know after being a bit nasty and

291
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,360
then wanted to be friends again and as

292
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,799
you can see he had no clue

293
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,719
of what he should have been saying they

294
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,399
couldn't remember and in the end slipped

295
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:36,719
up

296
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,159
after we suggested that his wife was

297
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,679
helen and and gave him the what

298
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,880
screenshot

299
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,799
and then afterwards he tried to

300
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,640
backpedal in the bottom bottom left and

301
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,440
you know said

302
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,839
sarah was an ex he got confused i mean

303
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,440
who else forgets their wife's name for

304
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,720
crying out loud you know

305
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,200
you'd stick to your guns you know andy's

306
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,720
creator forgot the name of andy's wife

307
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,480
because he was just really sloppy

308
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,399
um so sloppy in fact that some more

309
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,839
awesome people joined us

310
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,160
and through some ocean work traced this

311
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,480
all to a man behind the sock account

312
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,240
who i can't say anymore but happens to

313
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,519
be a ciso which was

314
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,480
another interesting story anyhow back to

315
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,200
our story

316
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,399
i digress um a year passes

317
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,120
my 18 year old persona has been built

318
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,200
and my target is a public employees djs

319
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,800
you know i decided i should give a demo

320
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,640
tape there and why not they think i'm 18

321
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,080
or at least they pretend to right

322
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,360
let's do it i got my first gig

323
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,360
at a pretty rundown pub not as bad as

324
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,120
the one in the photo but not far off it

325
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,160
to be honest

326
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,680
um it was quite common to see a ball

327
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,279
from the pool table end up in someone's

328
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,360
face most nights i played there

329
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,480
and when i first played there i thought

330
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,920
it was a really cool thing that the dj

331
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,600
booth was in a cage but then i realized

332
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,480
quite quickly it wasn't just for show

333
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,959
when i was getting a drink out the cage

334
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,640
i got very used to kind of ducking let's

335
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,160
just put it that way

336
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,320
now after the pub shift ended i'd

337
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,839
obviously stopped djing all the staff

338
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,760
would go on maps to a nightclub

339
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,360
um and there was one i really wanted to

340
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,279
go to but i've been rejected so many

341
00:09:59,279 --> 00:09:59,760
times

342
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,680
um and i didn't want to get turned away

343
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,959
in front of everyone in the pub

344
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,120
risked not being able to play there even

345
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,720
as terrible as it was

346
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,920
um so if they were going to this

347
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,120
particular club i'd normally make

348
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,640
excuses slope off

349
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,120
um but after a few times a day doing

350
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,040
this the bar manager insisted i joined

351
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,640
and you know it's one you can't really

352
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,560
get out of so

353
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,560
i'm going along i'm hoping it goes all

354
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,160
right but i'm really afraid that the end

355
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,519
of my music career

356
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,640
has happened before it's even started so

357
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,839
we turn up at the nightclub

358
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,760
the doormen are in suits they look

359
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,760
serious if they were a tech company to

360
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,200
paraphrase the beer farmers

361
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,720
they would not need to tell people that

362
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,480
they took security seriously

363
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,959
we get to the door it's our turn i'm

364
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,560
trying not to shake i'm trying not to

365
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,240
sweat i'm trying not to be sick

366
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,160
on his nice black shoes we just go in

367
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,839
and turns out the bar manager knows

368
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,600
everyone right they trust him

369
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,519
i'm now trusted like a rogue certificate

370
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,920
in a public key infrastructure

371
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,760
at a very high level public key

372
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,279
infrastructure pki

373
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,200
is a way that the user's public key is

374
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,640
bound to an organization

375
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,480
you have root certificate authorities

376
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,079
cas which are considered trusted

377
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:04,720
entities

378
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,399
and because of this trust they then act

379
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,079
as authoritative voices

380
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,920
on the bindings they're aware of so they

381
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,760
do this by checking organizations and

382
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,800
issuing digital

383
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
certificates as a bond of their trust in

384
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,160
an organization

385
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,680
in turn cas that aren't aware of the

386
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,240
bindings consult root cas or another ca

387
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,839
that's obtained information from them

388
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,040
to check the integrity of an

389
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,519
organization and you can have many

390
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,720
different route cas

391
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,920
and the most prevalent use of their

392
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,440
trust is with the little green padlock

393
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,519
in your favorite web browser

394
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,720
but the important things to remember are

395
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,560
that any ca can be a route ca just

396
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,160
because one was trustworthy today

397
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,760
doesn't even mean it's trustworthy

398
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,560
tomorrow

399
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,240
and some don't even check their facts

400
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,519
before they trust something and this

401
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,480
blind trust

402
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,720
is what caused the komodo pki hack in

403
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,760
2011

404
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,120
which allowed an organic ruge

405
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,040
organization to pretend where

406
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,519
they were google mail hotmail or yahoo

407
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,959
mail and loads of others

408
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,839
yeah they poisoned the pki and in a

409
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,920
similar way i poisoned the pki

410
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,000
of a nightclub human key infrastructure

411
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,920
hki poisoning right

412
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,680
um i was purporting to be an

413
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,440
organization that was 18 years old and

414
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,560
eligible to work

415
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,320
the bar manager where i dj'd was a

416
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,240
trusted entity for many others so we'll

417
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,839
call him a root ca

418
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,440
but they hadn't verified the facts i

419
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,440
wasn't 18 and

420
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,440
asking for a passport or another way of

421
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,120
verifying would would have shown this

422
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,920
right

423
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,680
from the h cairo poisoning i gained the

424
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,600
trust of the promoter of the nightclub

425
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,760
it gives me a staffy ip card great more

426
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,680
authentication and credentials

427
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,519
the door staff and bar staff now accept

428
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,880
i'm 18 through the trust of the bar

429
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,240
manager and the promoter and going

430
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,079
forward if i got asked for id anywhere

431
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,680
i'll just go no i'm afraid not but i've

432
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,680
got one of these present the card walk

433
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,639
in

434
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,240
the promoter also suggests that i should

435
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,760
come to an open decks night and for the

436
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,560
pre-club bar

437
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,240
so we'll win that i'm now a resident dj

438
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,720
there great so we all live happily ever

439
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,399
after the story ends and you wonder why

440
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,160
i've spoken more and more about public

441
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,519
key infrastructure that i have on up

442
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,079
second social engineering

443
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,000
no not quite yet we're just getting

444
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,800
started to be honest let's continue

445
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,160
see things are actually all right for

446
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,560
quite a while 15 16 17 year old me was

447
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,560
happy that people bought my story

448
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,680
i was 19 20 21 now for them uh

449
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,440
whether or not it was truly the case i

450
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,959
don't know but at the same time

451
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,440
i believe that my secrets my upset was

452
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,639
was robust

453
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,160
i kept playing every saturday in the

454
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,320
pre-club bar and there was a lot more

455
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,360
friend it was a lot more friendly and

456
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,120
better paid than the rundown pub

457
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,560
um there was still a bit of violence but

458
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,639
door staff made me stop that and people

459
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,160
generally friendly i played my chains i

460
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,519
went clubbing afterwards

461
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,920
then i'd walk four miles home absolutely

462
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,760
plastered carrying a silver steel record

463
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,120
box filled with vinyl

464
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,440
mainly chosen as a part prop to let make

465
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,880
sure other security teams had let me

466
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,160
into their clubs even if i wasn't

467
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,160
playing there i'll just carry it around

468
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,160
i'm not gonna get home between five or

469
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,199
six in the morning

470
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,320
um quite young i swear um but s

471
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,839
some time passed and i started getting

472
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,760
regular people come to hear me dj people

473
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,040
shaking my hand at the end of sets

474
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,040
also starting to get my first mentions

475
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,040
in local paper club life sections like

476
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,000
this one

477
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,519
um other than the very sexist

478
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,440
descriptions of various female customers

479
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,639
the journalist writes about there is

480
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,240
another problem

481
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,959
i'm 17 and i'm still underage and things

482
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,800
suddenly change quite rapidly and

483
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,480
new threats start to emerge so whilst

484
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,920
things are very friendly in the pre-club

485
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,760
bar in the nightclub above most of the

486
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,800
time it's fine

487
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,320
but every now and again things would go

488
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,600
well let's just call it a little bit

489
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,560
strange

490
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,320
um and if anyone's heard the story of

491
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,600
the legendary cassie and the nightclub

492
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,399
in manchester

493
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,760
you'll know that for a long time it was

494
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,760
an amazing venue providing the best that

495
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,680
music of that time had to offer

496
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,040
and you'll also hear that it had to be

497
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,600
closed in 1997 due to rival drug dealers

498
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,440
often in gang stabbing shooting not only

499
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,079
each other

500
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,839
but people that work there and innocent

501
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,079
punters too um i never went there but

502
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,360
i'm friends with people that did

503
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,000
regularly

504
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,680
and they talk about such fondness but

505
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,320
also so much sadness of how it ended

506
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,240
um with our nightclub above it was a

507
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,519
pretty similar thing

508
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,440
you know you had two gangs mainly made

509
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,240
up of grown-up men 28 to 38 years old

510
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,320
which now i'm around that age i find so

511
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,839
bizarre it's unreal

512
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,680
um and they all had pretty truly

513
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,440
psychopathic tendencies you know for the

514
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,399
most part they're all

515
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,320
very polite and friendly however

516
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,079
underneath that smiling exterior

517
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,360
you can see in their eyes you never want

518
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,560
to really make them angry if you can

519
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,360
help it

520
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,120
it's a really chilly free feeling but i

521
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,639
can't really express but it's on the

522
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,959
present when they took speed to you

523
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,160
um and when they look at you and

524
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,680
sometimes they just torment people for

525
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,560
fun you know

526
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,320
uh one minute they're joking then they

527
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,519
turn on the sixpence screaming at

528
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,120
someone's face they've offended them

529
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,720
then going back to joking to them for

530
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,800
stupid thinking that then if a person

531
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,000
might crack a joke

532
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,199
to go back they might put their arm

533
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,639
around them they might glass them you

534
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:29,360
never knew

535
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,120
and it really wasn't nice it's a bit

536
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,560
like social media sometimes but with

537
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,560
physical pain too

538
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,040
so along with dj and the three club bar

539
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,000
i've now got a job

540
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,639
in the club on the lights great so for

541
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,000
the most part things are happy

542
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,920
but i also see some really horrific

543
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,680
things you know one gang member

544
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,680
knocks down this scrawny little kid half

545
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,600
their size stamps the head into some

546
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,160
huge metal studs like that um which hold

547
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,839
the building structure in place and you

548
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:54,399
know luckily

549
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,759
the kid survived but he's a really

550
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,440
broken way he never found out if he

551
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,639
fully recovered but

552
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,480
you know it's pretty horrific so i've

553
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,000
had to build another persona

554
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,079
with a bit more depth one that's a bit

555
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,600
more tougher that could handle himself

556
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,759
i also took up boxing you know carrying

557
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,199
100 records four miles every week

558
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,199
certainly helped build strength as well

559
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,880
um but i had to start thinking about

560
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,880
strategies from not set point where you

561
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,560
know if things go too bad

562
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,480
do i use my rekordbox as a weapon now

563
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,600
you know if i need to

564
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,279
you know really quite dark thoughts

565
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,040
and one day one of the gang members has

566
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,279
a great idea while i'm djing

567
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,000
hi dan oh you you dj you never get your

568
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,120
back checked do you

569
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,120
right well if i give you some things

570
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,120
like you can go past security and you

571
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,240
can just give him back to me when you're

572
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,440
out yeah

573
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,880
and at this point i feel sick so i know

574
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,720
what he means by things and yeah i don't

575
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,680
want to do this

576
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,959
i don't want to end up in prison yeah so

577
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,120
i think i give him diversions if i smile

578
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,040
from the dj booth like this

579
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,880
and pretend that i can't hear him then

580
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,639
hopefully he'll just go away

581
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,920
and that worked and that was good but he

582
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,199
came back

583
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,839
every week week after week um until one

584
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:00,399
day

585
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,720
you know i decided i finished playing i

586
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,480
go out to get some money out from a cash

587
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,000
board down the road

588
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,880
and i see him behind me and he comes out

589
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,919
danny boy

590
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,079
i [ __ ] hate being called danny boy

591
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,599
daddy boy

592
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,640
about this favor mate you gotta do it

593
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,000
mate i don't know what you're on about

594
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,319
danny boy you know and you better do it

595
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,240
because everybody needs a favor right

596
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,439
and you never know what's gonna happen

597
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,919
next mate like don't be a [ __ ]

598
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,079
so he's now pulled out a knife and it's

599
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,280
not waving it in my face

600
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,039
he doesn't need to he's just playing

601
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,360
with it see let me see how sharp it is

602
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,679
and smirk the omnipresent chilling ice

603
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:36,400
there

604
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,799
seeming to suckle strength from me so i

605
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,320
take a deep breath

606
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,200
i gulp and i look i just go to i really

607
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,160
want to help i can't

608
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,160
um if i get caught with that i'm i'm

609
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,679
absolutely screwed um

610
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,120
i don't want to go to prison i've got a

611
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,880
lot of respect for you so i'm not lying

612
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,280
to you

613
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,120
and i really hope you respect that but i

614
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,640
just can't do it and i'm really

615
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,440
really sorry and i'm shaking while i say

616
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,039
this i'm i'm not sure if i

617
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,799
i could be sick but i feel very much

618
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,559
like it and i feel so known

619
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:03,760
that i don't know what the rest of my

620
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,600
body's doing

621
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,600
so he looks up to me and he's not really

622
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,360
that happy at all and he just goes

623
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,799
don't worry danny boy i'm only playing

624
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,120
with you

625
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,520
now he wasn't or was he you know i'll

626
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,320
never know

627
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,200
um but my upset now had to strengthen me

628
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,960
even more you know it wasn't just

629
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,799
lying about my age it was making sure i

630
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,240
never owed him a favor

631
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,760
because he wants to call her back you

632
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,360
know if he brought me a drink

633
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,880
without me asking i'd get him one

634
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,640
straight back um

635
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,400
anything that he could argue was a favor

636
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,080
despite me not asking for it i'd make

637
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,440
sure that slate was clean by the end of

638
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,360
the night like a gamer cat and mouse

639
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,600
um i needed to protect myself from owing

640
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,520
anything and i'm very wary of it

641
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,360
with other people that i don't know even

642
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,559
now because you never know

643
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,720
yeah contrary to popular belief thanks

644
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,679
films

645
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,840
criminals sometimes don't have scars

646
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,600
they sometimes don't look evil

647
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,440
sometimes they don't even sound anything

648
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,880
like adam rickman

649
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,640
and they look perfectly pleasant they

650
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,400
try and trap you into a situation they

651
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,919
try and convince you that there's no

652
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,200
option but to comply

653
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,200
they try and socially engineer you and

654
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,720
you need counter strategies

655
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,520
to prevent that and this wasn't the only

656
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,559
worry either

657
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,559
you see oh see the legislation called

658
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,559
the licensing young persons act 2000

659
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,240
suddenly increases fines for underage

660
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,840
drinking to 5 000 pounds

661
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,840
per individual involved in the sale so

662
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,039
instead of just the landlord

663
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,280
everyone gets fined the government's

664
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,799
really serious at stopping underage

665
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,760
drinking you know

666
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,840
pub raids on pubs and clubs happen this

667
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,880
makes everyone know

668
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,480
everything's going to change you know

669
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,240
many young bar staff now personally

670
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:32,799
liable

671
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,799
can't take a risk at losing that much

672
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,640
money insist they're protected

673
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,200
the door staff start asking doors for

674
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,320
everyone you know

675
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,240
passport driver's license get the [ __ ]

676
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,520
out luckily

677
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,120
thanks to my social engineering human

678
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,520
key infrastructure poisoning my vip card

679
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,720
still holds as much weight as the

680
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,840
government document

681
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,440
yay well for now anyway you see

682
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,880
a new doorman joined the nightclub and

683
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,480
they wanted things verified that were

684
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,480
told to them they were a proper root ca

685
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,280
you know

686
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,960
they did not work on trusting others

687
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,559
they took it upon themselves to seek the

688
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:03,120
truth

689
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,880
oh no based on the review in the paper

690
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,480
the pre-club bar also got some flyers

691
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,080
printed with my name on it and we had

692
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,039
special guests

693
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,960
would do the early part of the night yo

694
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,480
with me following and i thought this was

695
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,520
great i loved it

696
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,280
you know but i i didn't think how it

697
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,640
could actually be used against me

698
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,320
and that's my actual name on there and

699
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,159
i'm under 18 and there aren't that many

700
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,919
people with the surname cod in the uk

701
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,159
let alone sussex

702
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,200
so as a way of highlighting how much of

703
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,720
an upset fail this was

704
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,880
yeah here's a listing from 192.com for

705
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,280
dan j cons that it's aware of in the uk

706
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,880
and now there's four sussex addresses on

707
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,400
there and they're all me

708
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,159
um by the way definitely look up

709
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,760
yourself on oneline2.com because even

710
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,480
though

711
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,240
i've opted out of the open register

712
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,840
therefore should have none of my details

713
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,039
given to a business

714
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,120
192.com kept the data of my addresses

715
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,240
before i opted out

716
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,520
and it tells you where i have lived

717
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,480
according to the electoral roll

718
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,000
and for a few pounds you can get some

719
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,679
credits and decide to get an in-depth

720
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,280
background report on someone that

721
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,720
provides all of their full addresses

722
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,080
along with convenient maps with the

723
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,679
rough value of each house

724
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,080
and who else loses them for a pivot you

725
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,200
know luckily

726
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,640
to delete your data from there it only

727
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,720
takes 24 hours

728
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,720
now 192.com didn't exist when our

729
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,320
detective doorman was refusing to

730
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,159
blindly trust our human key

731
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,120
infrastructure

732
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,799
instead we have the phone book you know

733
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,240
the phone book still exists it's a

734
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,919
register of everyone's name address and

735
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:22,880
landline number

736
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,360
providing a nyx directory uh now i'm not

737
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,640
in the phone book and i certainly wasn't

738
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,360
this time

739
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,240
so that's great opsec right well not in

740
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,080
this situation no

741
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,000
just to paint a scene i'm now two months

742
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,679
off my 18th birthday

743
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,840
lots of pubs and clubs are demanding id

744
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,440
i've lost quite a few gigs now with

745
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,960
security and now demanding it from

746
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,960
people that you know rock up to gigs

747
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,360
um and even my still silver record box

748
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,480
suggesting to them

749
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,400
that i'm playing they're not buying it

750
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,400
anymore they're still asking why would

751
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,280
they do that

752
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,799
you know it's harder for me to get a

753
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,080
drink now than what it was when i was

754
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,039
14.

755
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,720
the only places i can get served without

756
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,159
hassle the pre-club bar where my

757
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,039
residency is

758
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,600
and the club joined to it so i'm

759
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,120
panicked all the time that i will get

760
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,120
found out and lose even those gigs and

761
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,400
then everything you know

762
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,400
i want i'm i'm worried about gang

763
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,919
members that i'm avoiding trying not to

764
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,679
owe them a favor in case they want me to

765
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:12,640
pay them back

766
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,039
my opsec has taken absolute battering

767
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,799
and i'm getting desperate just two more

768
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:17,760
months keep this

769
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,440
persona going then you can play in other

770
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,159
clubs legally always going to be fine

771
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,360
anyway this detective dorman says it's

772
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,120
weird you know i really can't find khan

773
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,240
in the phone book

774
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,480
i was like oh really i've got to think

775
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,679
of a diversion

776
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,799
um yeah yeah really

777
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,480
well it's not weird really you know i

778
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,080
live with my parents like a lot of 21

779
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,520
year olds you know

780
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,640
yeah but you're also not on the

781
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,000
electoral roll you know i've looked

782
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,440
there as well

783
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,360
oh really how'd you do that that's

784
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,880
that's interesting i did not plan for

785
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,919
that

786
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,240
well that's that's because i don't vote

787
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,440
you know

788
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,559
i want to see your passport next week uh

789
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,280
well you see i

790
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,720
don't have a valid passport you know

791
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,400
i've got it sent off to get redeemed but

792
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,919
due to the backlog of the millennium

793
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,120
millennium book yeah

794
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,039
um i still haven't had it back so it's

795
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,480
stuck in newport gwent where the

796
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,200
password

797
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,200
passport office is and you know i'll try

798
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,559
and find them and nothing comes back you

799
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:09,520
know nothing

800
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,000
um now this story sounds as implausible

801
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,760
as an eye test in durham castle right

802
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,679
um there was a processing backlog at the

803
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,240
time and is there still at this point

804
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,240
you know me giving the passport office

805
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,000
location sounds like unnecessary

806
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,240
fact trying to divert and keep authority

807
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,159
to a pack of lies but

808
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,280
you know he's not being social

809
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,799
engineered he's seen that this is a pack

810
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,640
of lies detective dorman smirks you know

811
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,000
he's not buying it but

812
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,960
he humors me well when do you think

813
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,880
you're gonna get it back

814
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,280
um what well you know i'm not the

815
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,799
government you know um

816
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,360
i'd imagine that two months time two

817
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,320
months really

818
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,400
oh well it better be and that was that

819
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,159
you know the agreement was my passport

820
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:51,679
to come back in two months when i then

821
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,200
finally would be 18.

822
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,200
i'm still using diversion and personas

823
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,880
to socially engineer people to allow me

824
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,840
to stay playing

825
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,080
i'm still trying to keep my secrets safe

826
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,840
through my very fragile ops second just

827
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,520
hoping no one digs too deep at this

828
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,240
point

829
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,120
um so yes quite clearly mistakes made

830
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,240
but i think i did

831
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,760
pretty well keeping all this stuff under

832
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,440
wraps for three years

833
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,840
um i learned how to create personas and

834
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,360
adapt them to convince people to form

835
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,559
actions that they might not have wanted

836
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:17,360
to otherwise

837
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,440
i stayed confident but not arrogant um

838
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,720
well maybe not in the final year i mean

839
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,880
what 17 year old isn't is not arrogant

840
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,440
right

841
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,919
but anyway i've i forgot about freely

842
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,679
available information and i forgot to

843
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,760
factor that into my personas

844
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,520
um you know using open source

845
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,279
intelligent ocean to find information

846
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,320
about yourself and what you need to

847
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,760
delete or change

848
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,840
is is really important you know we we

849
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,200
also learned to create believable

850
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,679
characters my 21 year old persona was

851
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,279
probably not that believable

852
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,840
andy numbers definitely wasn't

853
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,640
believable um

854
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,559
but most importantly don't do crying you

855
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,159
know i'm glad i chose not to i would

856
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:51,919
have had my life ruined at 17.

857
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,600
um and i wouldn't be talking to you

858
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,360
today i'd either be in prison or maybe

859
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,159
dead

860
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,080
um and it might not seem that way but

861
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,000
there is always always another

862
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,200
option if you talk to people so before i

863
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:03,760
leave

864
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,520

bloody scary um

906
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,480
yeah but yeah it's been absolutely

907
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,320
fantastic have we got any questions for

908
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,559
dan

909
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,919
none came through from the audience

910
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:26,240
everyone was just laughing constantly

911
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,240
all the little subtle humor hints and

912
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:28,880
stuff

913
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,200
um just from my point of view i and i

914
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,200
think mike's and ian's

915
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,559
um the people that were ex-musicians i

916
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,400
guess or current musicians and kind of

917
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,120
drifted into infosec for other reasons

918
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,200
yeah i we've been in the same position

919
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,720
man we've been right there i've been the

920
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,640
underage kid playing in a bar kicking

921
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,320
other underage kids out because i'm like

922
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,080
if you get busted they're gonna start

923
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,679
asking me for id

924
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:54,400
and yeah we've we've been there man like

925
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,159
the the pubs i played in were equally

926
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,919
rough and i think i've told you a few

927
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,200
stories and

928
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,960
you know we weren't paid in cash we were

929
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,400
paid in a box of beer and a bag of

930
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,000
you know that was that was the going

931
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,919
rate for a band and it was cheaper than

932
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,880
paying his cash but no i've a really

933
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,440
really

934
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,559
brilliant talk um there is questions now

935
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,080
coming in people have actually went oh

936
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,919
[ __ ] okay get the questions in before

937
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:21,840
you do the question scott um

938
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,440
you can't see this but i've got a scar

939
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,279
that's about an inch and a half long

940
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,559
on my inside of my elbow here i got that

941
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,080
in the hacienda

942
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,440
really yeah yeah um

943
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,200
be careful be careful when you knock

944
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,520
over somebody's drink this is a lesson

945
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,840
that i learned that night but yeah scott

946
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,080
questions

947
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,720
that's a yeah good piece of advice for

948
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,520
life really

949
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,799
um but yeah from juan he's asked what

950
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,640
strategies can you recommend for

951
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,320
strengthening your opsec

952
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,240
what would you recommend as a starting

953
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,919
point

954
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,559
i would say first stop would be going to

955
00:27:58,559 --> 00:27:59,679
that upset

956
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,039
is for everyone not just people

957
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,720
something hide article and do pretty

958
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,559
much everything in there that she

959
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,240
kind of recommends you know but going

960
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,840
going through certainly just googling

961
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,360
stuff you know google docs would be your

962
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,080
best one

963
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,760
you know seeing what what is actually

964
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,200
out there on you

965
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,919
and deleting it okay but also you know

966
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:16,720
kind of

967
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,559
you know being a bit sensible with it

968
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,240
you know there are some times that

969
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,080
you're going to need

970
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,320
to have stuff about you online you know

971
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,200
if you

972
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,559
you know i've got people that i work

973
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,159
with for example who have absolutely

974
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,559
nothing online but then wonder why

975
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,720
they have nothing to show maybe if they

976
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,240
go for a job interview or

977
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,240
you know you've got to find a balance

978
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,679
which is you know that you're giving

979
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:38,880
some information out but you're not

980
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,240
necessarily giving your address i mean

981
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,200
certainly

982
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,799
if you're on instagram or something be

983
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,320
very weary you know

984
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,120
take photos inside by all means um

985
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,159
unless you're going to give them cyber

986
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,000
viking or rag but

987
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,080
um you know don't do them outside your

988
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,360
house because

989
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,440
um you know your hou you're outside your

990
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,480
house is very

991
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,640
unique a lot of the time and yeah people

992
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,240
can find you or certainly yeah

993
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,799
quite easily

994
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,840
oh thanks um that's all the questions

995
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,320
from

996
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,080
slag just there's a outpouring

997
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,799
twitch of people just going laughing at

998
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,399
various comments you made

999
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,600
um or absolutely agreeing and

1000
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,279
and saying someone just said the trip by

1001
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,880
article was very informative

1002
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,960
um no honestly like i totally get it um

1003
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,399
it's not difficult to find me it's not

1004
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,080
difficult to find past music

1005
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,200
relationships it bugs me i've just

1006
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,240
learned to live with it

1007
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,279
um luckily i've got a brooder who takes

1008
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:36,080
most of the

1009
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,480
flack now which is excellent but um no

1010
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,480
dan that was excellent mike sean

1011
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,279
do you want to jump in

1012
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,720
great talk yeah absolutely and it's all

1013
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,960
another thing i'll say is that

1014
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,320
it's always great when you can draw a

1015
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,880
parallel between things in normal

1016
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,000
air quotes normal life and information

1017
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,200
security

1018
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,120
because it it brings a narrative in a

1019
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,120
context that makes it a lot easier for

1020
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,640
people to understand

1021
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,919
because you didn't really talk about

1022
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,559
infosec particularly apart from pki

1023
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,080
the interesting point was the hki stuff

1024
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,520
okay yeah and that's the bit where you

1025
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,200
draw the line between

1026
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,760
human behavior and their information

1027
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,760
security and their and their opsec and

1028
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,360
obviously in the social engineering

1029
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,960
aspects of it so

1030
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,039

1031
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,880
