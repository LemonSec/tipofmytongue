1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:04,799
hi

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,120
everyone and we're back at beer con 2

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,800
rise of the rookie and i am

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,840
absolutely delighted to introduce ray

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,200
jeffries harris

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,320
who is a content developer

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,600
for immersive labs um and so she is

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,800
a lady with a completely devious mind

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,199
that tortures people that try to hack

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,400
her stuff

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,960
so with no further ado ray over to you

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,600
hi i'm ray and i'm going to talk about

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,640
hackers who had

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,360
no intention of being malicious but you

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,239
probably guessed that from the title

16
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,200
first i'd like to pose a question to you

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,480
who came first

18
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,000
white hat hackers or black cat hackers

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,640
the question is probably about as fair

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,559
as asking whether the chicken or the egg

21
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:53,920
came first

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,600
you can argue either side but at the end

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,960
of the day you'll still be able to make

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,440
a meal out of it

25
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,600
the logical thought process would be to

26
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,159
think that malicious hackers came first

27
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,400
and that the valiant ethical hackers

28
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,880
rose up to defend against them

29
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,320
but there were people warning about

30
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,320
security vulnerabilities

31
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,040
long before they were ever exploited

32
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,880
would they not count as ethical hackers

33
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,799
in today's climate

34
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,520
the next question is who gets the most

35
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,799
attention

36
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,560
now that is much easier

37
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,759
headline news is unlikely to ever be

38
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,560
ethical hackers it's always the hacks

39
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,520
that scared us

40
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,119
the hacks that threatened us in some way

41
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,439
shape or form the wannacries of the

42
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,960
world

43
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,360
unfortunately this means the general

44
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,520
public have a very skewed view

45
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,439
on what hacking is but the good news is

46
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,600
there is another kind of hacker who will

47
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,799
on occasion

48
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,159
make headlines now this type of hacker

49
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,000
isn't good but they're not bad either

50
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,119
you would call them a grey hat hacker

51
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,840
returning to my original question of who

52
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,880
came first

53
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,680
malicious hackers or ethical hackers i

54
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,038
would like to make an argument

55
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,319
for neither allow me to explain

56
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,040
we often think of computer viruses as

57
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,520
being

58
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,080
malicious and destructive but at the

59
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,280
dawn of malware

60
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,040
back when viruses were spread between

61
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,879
machines on floppy disk

62
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,920
this just wasn't the case in fact they

63
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,760
were usually harmless

64
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,520
they would often play music or

65
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,200
animations for you

66
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,480
or have an amusing message like this one

67
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,400
which would infect your computer then

68
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,800
display terminator message

69
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,000
don't be afraid i am a very kind virus

70
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,400
you have to do many works today so i

71
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,640
will let your computer slow down

72
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,080
have a nice day goodbye press a key to

73
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,319
continue

74
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,599
this isn't an isolated example

75
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,840
the first virus to hit ms-dos was

76
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,040
designed to be harmless

77
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,640
it even had the phone numbers of the

78
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,000
creators displayed so that you could

79
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,159
ring them for help removing the virus

80
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,120
the morris worm released in 1988 took

81
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,720
down approximately 10

82
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,440
of the internet in its time but it had

83
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,599
no intention of causing harm

84
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,360
robert morris simply wanted to know how

85
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,800
big the internet was

86
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,040
and tried to notify people of a fix as

87
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,879
soon as he realized how catastrophic the

88
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,440
code he'd released was

89
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,920
the first one to spread by email was

90
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,319
described by the author as a sympathetic

91
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,280
hitchhiker

92
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,959
who uses your internet connection to

93
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,400
travel and thanks you

94
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,599
with a small animation of course

95
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,760
there were malicious hacks interspersed

96
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,760
but mostly hacks were just

97
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,040
well hacks they weren't good or bad

98
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,280
someone was curious about how far they

99
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,879
could get their virus to travel

100
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,480
was curious about what boundaries they

101
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,640
could push or maybe just wanted to make

102
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,760
their machine behave

103
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,519
a little differently because hacking

104
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,760
at its core is just prodding a machine

105
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,680
to see how it works

106
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,599
and to see how you can make it work for

107
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,040
you

108
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,280
which brings us on to one of my favorite

109
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,480
hackers

110
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,840
sami kamkar see sami was

111
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,400
good at making computers work for him

112
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,439
when he was younger

113
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,280
he really enjoyed playing the video game

114
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,720
counter-strike

115
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,279
it's a first-person shooter game but he

116
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,720
was a curious kid

117
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,400
and began to wonder how much of the

118
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,560
gameplay he had control over

119
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,560
what had the developers made client-side

120
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,240
that he could use

121
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,400
so he started working out ways to hack

122
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,520
the game

123
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,680
not much just enough to give himself a

124
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,360
slight advantage

125
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,199
he'd often share these cheap bits of

126
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,280
code around and the developers would

127
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,840
inevitably end up fixing the

128
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,560
vulnerabilities so

129
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,280
sami would find a way around the fix it

130
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,960
became more of a game than the video

131
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,160
game itself

132
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,919
sami finding vulnerabilities and the

133
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,919
developers updating the game code to fix

134
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,160
the vulnerability

135
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,320
if we fast forward a couple of years to

136
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,280
2005

137
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,840
and i hope you'll excuse me if i digress

138
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,720
for a second

139
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,039
but for those who are less familiar with

140
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,800
web development i'm going to do a quick

141
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,600
intro here into html css and javascript

142
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,479
broadly speaking websites use three

143
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,919
different programming languages to

144
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,560
produce their user experience

145
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,080
html css and javascript

146
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,320
html is for adding meaning to raw

147
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,240
content by marking it up

148
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,120
css is for formatting that marked up

149
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,080
content

150
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,759
and javascript is for making that

151
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,280
content and formatting

152
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,440
interactive for example this html marks

153
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,320
the text

154
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,800
this is a paragraph as a paragraph which

155
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,360
is shown by the p tag

156
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,479
you can then add css to style html

157
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,639
the style tag we've used here sets all

158
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,720
paragraphs to use a font size of 32

159
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,600
pixels and to be the color blue

160
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,440
then we add javascript to make it

161
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,600
interactive the code you can see on the

162
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,000
screen

163
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,840
adds an event listener to our paragraph

164
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,680
so that if the paragraph is clicked

165
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,800
the text will change to you clicked it

166
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,080
so we click the text and it changed to

167
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,120
you clicked it so hopefully this gives

168
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,639
you a good idea

169
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,720
of what html css and javascript are used

170
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,680
for

171
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,479
it's also worth noting that this entire

172
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,520
script can be

173
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,639
rewritten to achieve the same effect the

174
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,440
style has been moved into the paragraph

175
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,440
tag and the javascript is now run by the

176
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,360
on click attribute

177
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,840
this produces exactly the same result

178
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,319
that we saw before

179
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,479
so back to sami 2005

180
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,919
sammy is now 19. now

181
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,120
at the time myspace was the biggest site

182
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,240
on the internet

183
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,720
bigger than google which is quite

184
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,800
frankly astounding considering it looked

185
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,199
like

186
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,759
this it was a social networking site

187
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,680
one that you could personalize by adding

188
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,800
css to style your page however you liked

189
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,880
if you have a look at the music input

190
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,280
field here you can see some html tags

191
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:09,759
which

192
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,599
make it look like this on my profile

193
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,880
now sami thought this was pretty neat

194
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,720
but he wondered how he could make his

195
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,000
page stand out

196
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,240
and remember he's built up some mad

197
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,280
hacking skills from hacking video games

198
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,039
so he started looking at the

199
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,120
restrictions myspace had

200
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,759
he realized that there was a limit of 12

201
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,280
pictures that you were allowed to have

202
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,720
on your profile

203
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,199
so he thought it would be quite funny if

204
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,240
he just added a 13th

205
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,759
it was a small change no one would

206
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,440
really notice but it was subtle and it

207
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,960
amused him

208
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,000
now the number of photos was set by

209
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,759
client-side validation so

210
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,759
he could easily bypass this and make

211
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,599
requests directly to the server

212
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,639
submit as many photos as he liked he

213
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,199
started wondering what else he could do

214
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,280
now the myspace profile had the option

215
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,520
to set a relationship status

216
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,440
you could choose from options like

217
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,360
single in a relationship

218
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,599
married but you couldn't set it to

219
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,360
whatever you wanted

220
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,319
sammy wanted to update his to be in a

221
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:14,800
hot

222
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,319
relationship again a funny yet subtle

223
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,680
change

224
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,160
but unlike the photo upload he didn't

225
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,479
have any sort of access to whatever code

226
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,639
set the relationship status

227
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,680
and he couldn't do this using css

228
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,320
he needed some way of adding javascript

229
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,559
to his page in order to do this

230
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,320
a little script like this would do the

231
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,080
trick

232
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,640
now myspace pretty much blocked

233
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,760
javascript in

234
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,200
every single way in fact the only html

235
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,680
tags allowed as far as sami could tell

236
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,360
were link tags image tags and div tags

237
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,839
it stripped out script tags body tags on

238
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,519
click attribute on anything

239
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,959
href you get the idea anything useful

240
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,760
was not allowed myspace had done a

241
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,440
reasonable job of protecting against

242
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,920
cross-site scripting vulnerabilities

243
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,080
of course sami would need such a

244
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,040
vulnerability

245
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,640
if he wanted to put javascript on his

246
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,240
profile

247
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,880
now as i've mentioned myspace lets users

248
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,480
style their page using

249
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,240
css so sami began looking at the browser

250
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,120
to see if he could

251
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,640
exploit the interpretation of css tags

252
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,040
now remember that css is for styling the

253
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,040
page setting things like the color

254
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,240
and the size however at the time

255
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,800
some browsers internet explorer and

256
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,800
several versions of safari

257
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,279
allowed javascript to be written in css

258
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,560
tags

259
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,680
so this code would be executed in the

260
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,040
browser to bring up

261
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,959
an alert box now he wants to change his

262
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,000
relationship status

263
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,480
to be in a hot relationship so he was

264
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,839
going to need to be able to put text in

265
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,279
this alert box

266
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,000
which means he needs to use quotations

267
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,920
currently he can't do that because he's

268
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,880
using both single and double quotations

269
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,040
but this is easily fixed he can either

270
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,880
escape quotations or

271
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,440
he can use an expression to store the

272
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,920
javascript and execute it by name

273
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,399
like so and if we run it in the browser

274
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:21,519
awesome we have text cool

275
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,800
unfortunately myspace is one step ahead

276
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,360
of him

277
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,560
and they strip out the word javascript

278
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,720
from well everywhere however

279
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,800
some browsers will interpret java

280
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,399
backslash n script

281
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,760
that's java newline script as javascript

282
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,560
bingo myspace now accepts it

283
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,519
and if we look at sami's profile you get

284
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,600
the following message on it

285
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,920
it's worth noting as well that though

286
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,399
the code is on sami's profile

287
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,640
and anyone who views his profile will

288
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,320
run the code in their browser

289
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,320
the code itself is only visible if you

290
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,079
look for it in their html

291
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,720
sami's profile would look normal for the

292
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,399
weird alert that pops up whenever you

293
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,079
view it

294
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,560
now to change his relationship status

295
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,079
sami was going to need to change the

296
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,480
inner text or in a html

297
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,519
on the page unfortunately myspace is one

298
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,720
step ahead of him again

299
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,880
and strips out either function

300
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,360
but that's all right sami can use an

301
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,399
eval function

302
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,920
and evaluate two strings to form in html

303
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,040
like so this

304
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,480
brings up an alert box

305
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,680
with all of the html within the body of

306
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,680
the page

307
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,120
fab that means we have everything that

308
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,720
we need to update the relationship

309
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,360
status

310
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,120
so if we take the code we want to write

311
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,560
and we convert it into the code that

312
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,439
we're allowed to write

313
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,360
it becomes something like this and if we

314
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,560
grab the code

315
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,839
and head on over to my beautiful 2005

316
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,079
myspace profile

317
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,399
so you can click the profile and you can

318
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,800
scroll down to see that currently it has

319
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,560
a status of in a relationship

320
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,360
and if we go up to edit the profile

321
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,680
and i'm going to add the code in the

322
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,959
about me section

323
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,320
so save that

324
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,720
view the profile and if we scroll down

325
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,800
you should be able to see that it has

326
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,920
been updated to

327
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,639
in a hot relationship rightfully so

328
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,839
and if we open the code in a new tab

329
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,639
and search for the about me section

330
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,880
we should be able to see our code just

331
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,200
there

332
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,959
cool but

333
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,399
what did that mean well he had found a

334
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,200
way to execute javascript on his profile

335
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,639
page

336
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,399
that meant anyone who visited his

337
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,560
profile page would run the javascript in

338
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,399
their browser

339
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,320
what's the point of having a 13th

340
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,839
picture and a status of being

341
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,440
in a hot relationship if no one sees it

342
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,360
so he wondered if he could make anyone

343
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,800
who visited his page

344
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,480
automatically add him as a friend and

345
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,000
he could and if he can control their

346
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,279
browser

347
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,279
could he update their own profile again

348
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,320
yes he wanted to do something funny

349
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,279
so now whenever someone visited his page

350
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,880
they would automatically add him as a

351
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,760
friend

352
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,560
and at the bottom of their profile right

353
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,760
but most of all

354
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,639
sammy is my hero

355
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,959
sami releases the code a few days go by

356
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,440
not many of his friends have hit it not

357
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,839
many people have visited his page

358
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,199
he wants it to spread a little faster

359
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,920
so how about when someone visits his

360
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,639
page

361
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,760
they add him as a friend

362
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,480
they update their profile with but most

363
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,120
of all sami is my hero

364
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,399
and then copy the code to their profile

365
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,880
this means that if anyone looks at their

366
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,720
profile they would add sami as a friend

367
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,760
update their profile and add the

368
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,639
javascript

369
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,000
to their page hopefully

370
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,399
you get the idea here's a quote i

371
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,320
particularly like from sammy

372
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,760
within my friend group it should

373
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,199
probably hit them all within a week or

374
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:53,600
so

375
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,440
and that'll be pretty funny someone will

376
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,680
complain it will get taken down

377
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,399
no big deal

378
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,600
sami releases the new and improved code

379
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,600
and then goes to sleep hoping to wake up

380
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:05,920
to

381
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,360
a few more friends he wakes up to 10 000

382
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,480
new friends

383
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,079
sami has just created a myspace world

384
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,480
in fact sami has created the fastest

385
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,480
spreading virus in history

386
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,880
within 20 hours over 1 million users

387
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,079
have run his payload

388
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,760
within 24 hours the whole site goes down

389
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,920
now this hack was not meant to be

390
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,120
malicious

391
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,440
to quote sami it was done in the

392
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,279
interest of interest

393
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,480
it was interesting and fun impressive

394
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,079
when you consider that this is what the

395
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,120
final version of the code looked like

396
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,959
i highly recommend checking out some of

397
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,639
the work samuel has done since then

398
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,959
particularly ever cookie which the nsa

399
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,720
have used as a method of tracking tour

400
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,120
users

401
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,320
now moving away from sami

402
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,360
a surprisingly similar hack happened in

403
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,600
on twitter in 2014. the self-retweeting

404
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,800
tweet

405
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,040
now this hack was similar to sami's in

406
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,120
that it exploited a cross-site scripting

407
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,160
vulnerability

408
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,320
but this was much simpler than the hoops

409
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,839
that sammy had to jump through to spread

410
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,839
his worm

411
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,040
essentially the script set a class

412
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,160
as xss it would then look for anything

413
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,199
with the class xss which would return

414
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,399
the script then it would find the

415
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,560
parents and select the parent containing

416
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,519
the retweet button

417
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,279
which is this box following that

418
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,680
it would then find the retweet button

419
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,199
and click it

420
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,880
then it would click to confirm that it

421
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,800
wants to retweet

422
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,800
and then finally you have the payload

423
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,560
which is an alert box saying

424
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,759
xss in tweetdeck

425
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,600
anyone viewing the message would just

426
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,240
see a little heart and a pop-up message

427
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,959
saying xss in tweetdeck whilst their

428
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,160
browser retweeted the tweet for them

429
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,360
as a result 83 000 twitter users

430
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,639
retweeted the script

431
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,799
and twitter quickly released an update

432
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,079
to fix it

433
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,959
again a self-replicating world again

434
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,640
does not appear to have any malicious

435
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,679
intent

436
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,760
in fact it goes out of its way to inform

437
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,280
users that there's a vulnerability on

438
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,280
the platform

439
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,079
which brings us to the final hack i'm

440
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,799
going to talk about today

441
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,240
at hackard giraffe in 2018 hacked 48 000

442
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,599
messages

443
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,440
48 000 printers to print out the

444
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,440
following message

445
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,280
pewdiepie is in trouble and needs your

446
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,280
help to defeat t-series

447
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,120
it goes on to explain what's going on

448
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,720
and at the bottom you have a little post

449
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,160
script saying pro tip

450
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,400
your printer is exposed to the internet

451
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,440
please fix that

452
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,480
greetings from a friendly giraffe now

453
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,640
this was an incredibly simple hack

454
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,799
he obtained a list of vulnerable

455
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,480
printers from shodan

456
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,240
a search engine for internet connected

457
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,799
devices then he used pret

458
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,440
the printer exploitation toolkit to

459
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,600
connect to each printer and print out

460
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,280
the txt file

461
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,440
there wasn't really any need to hack

462
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,600
anything the printers were exposed as

463
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,320
they weren't

464
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,960
sitting behind a firewall you can just

465
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,360
send commands directly to them

466
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,520
in the hacker's own words i killed two

467
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,039
birds with one stone

468
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,799
raised awareness for this issue and

469
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,960
helped pewdiepie get a slight edge

470
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,160
all the aforementioned hacks had no

471
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,440
malicious intent

472
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,559
but they all got a lot of attention and

473
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:30,960
that's

474
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,640
surely one of the best things you can

475
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,080
ask for because

476
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,720
the general public is not clued up on

477
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,400
cyber security

478
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,240
case in point when the morris one was

479
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,480
first released in 1988

480
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,720
a legitimate reporter rang up to ask

481
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,880
whether the virus could spread to infect

482
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,919
human bodies i'd like to take a moment

483
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,600
to assure you all that you are not

484
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,600
at risk from the morris worm the source

485
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,320
code is well contained in a secure

486
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,039
location and is well removed from the

487
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,320
general public

488
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,720
it's at the computer history museum in

489
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,799
california

490
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,240
jokes aside hacks like these get noticed

491
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,039
and have on numerous occasions mitigated

492
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,320
or even prevented

493
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,240
damage from future malicious hacks that

494
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,480
work on the same principles

495
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,120
moreover they give less technical folk

496
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,960
an insight into hacking that's

497
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,320
approachable

498
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,480
they don't aim to scare users and as a

499
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,600
result they provide

500
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,679
much better opportunities for growth and

501
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,760
learning than say

502
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,799
this so

503
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,360
remember that amongst all the

504
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,400
hacktivists

505
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,160
criminals spies there are

506
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,600
curious hackers who aim to surprise

507
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:52,080
and that's all folks

508
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,799
wow just absolutely brilliant i

509
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,480
certainly enjoyed that

510
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,039
rhea um one question of course leaps to

511
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,080
my mind is that

512
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:05,200
uh poking at myspace very old platform

513
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,600
modern um though when you see these

514
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,360
types of stuff

515
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,919
are things like facebook and linkedin

516
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,520
and uh more secure

517
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,200
as you know a result of those kind of

518
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,400
experimentations or

519
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,400
is it just sort of continues to be a

520
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,200
complete free-for-all

521
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,240
uh it's sort of a mix um

522
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,200
so for the most part i'd say they're

523
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,960
probably a lot better

524
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,440
uh but at the same time 2014 the

525
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,200
self-retweeting tweet that was something

526
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,600
that should not have been able to happen

527
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,720
and that was just basic not even

528
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,159
checking that there was a script tag

529
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,120
you don't get quite as many sort of

530
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,360
that blow up quite that much but i don't

531
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,039
know whether that's just because

532
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,520
uh it's normally when companies are more

533
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,120
establishing themselves that these are

534
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,799
more likely to happen

535
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,280
um so i don't know whether it's that

536
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,120
we've just not yet heard about

537
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,159
the next thing that's a disaster waiting

538
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:06,559
to

539
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,520
well not a disaster but they're always

540
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,640
quite good fun

541
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,320
certainly i guess sami could have made a

542
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,400
lot of money if there was a bug bounty

543
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,120
program

544
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,320
um in effect for for for myspace and

545
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,280
later on

546
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,840
um sean i'm gonna turn it over to you do

547
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,679
we have any questions from from

548
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,039
our audience um so i

549
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,720
haven't seen anything from twitch but i

550
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,919
do have a question myself um

551
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,360
so one of the perceptions is hackers are

552
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,000
bad and

553
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,200
these evil people are out to do evil

554
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,240
things and that

555
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,559
how do we change that perception because

556
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:45,520
obviously clearly

557
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,600
the that's not always the intent of

558
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,640
hackers um

559
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,360
hackers can sometimes be good people so

560
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,039
how can we change that in

561
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,880
the industry what are your views on

562
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,080
changing the industry

563
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,919
perception around that uh honestly i

564
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:00,960
think

565
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,440
it's helpful having people like these

566
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,799
who

567
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,960
are kind of just curious and probably

568
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,919
take things a little bit too far

569
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,720
because normally it's really funny and

570
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,159
things that get noticed

571
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,320
are normally either scary or amusing

572
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,000
so if you want them to get noticed

573
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,840
without like

574
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,679
attackers who are terrifying and live in

575
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,039
basements in

576
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:29,919
korea then you probably want to

577
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,400
find something that you can show people

578
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,000
that amuses them because

579
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,280
that's far more likely to get their

580
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,600
attention than just saying

581
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,280
you've got a vulnerability this this

582
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,840
needs fixing

583
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,799
i'll go with that

584
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,400
great answer i i totally agree with that

585
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,919
that's kind of what the beer farm is all

586
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:50,400
about

587
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,080
bringing in a bit of human hopefully

588
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,320
raising that awareness um

589
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,799
and totally agree with humor being a big

590
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,240
part of that

591
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,039
yeah i just want to make a comment ray

592
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:01,840
if that's okay

593
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,200
um a lot of people have commented on the

594
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,039
twitch that it's been a great trip down

595
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,080
memory lane and

596
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,400
you know back to times gone by and all

597
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,280
that kind of thing

598
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,760
but actually what was super cool about

599
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,919
talk was that it wasn't just a

600
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,720
nostalgia trip it was a dive into the

601
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,600
anatomy

602
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,159
of what actually happened during these

603
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:22,720
things

604
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,039
so it wasn't just oh yeah back then you

605
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,120
know myspace got done by a guy who was

606
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,559
nice guy actually and all that kind of

607
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,400
stuff what you took us through was the

608
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,720
the reality of it and how it happened

609
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,799
and then again the same with twitter in

610
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,320
2014 so

611
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,320
full credit to you for you know knowing

612
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,320
the subject inside out i just wanted to

613
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,240
say that so brilliant thank you

614
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,080
thank you yeah i have to agree

615
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,640
um the comments are absolutely brilliant

616
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,440
um

617
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,159
there is one one question from twitch

618
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,039
but before we

619
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,880
get on to that i just kind of wanted to

620
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,640
echo mike's comments again

621
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,640
just go it is a really really nice trip

622
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,200
down memory lane but with added context

623
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,120
and like added descriptions and and all

624
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,720
that kind of stuff it was it was great i

625
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,000
think i was one of the people to get hit

626
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,480
by

627
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,919
the sammy worm um and very confused for

628
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:10,799
a very long time

629
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,720
who is this guy and why is my profile

630
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,840
updated

631
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,520
um but mick labrade asks

632
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,240
which one was your favorite of all these

633
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,400
stories which one really captivated you

634
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:22,720
and

635
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,799
drew you in definitely sammy um

636
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,120
but that's largely because he's quite an

637
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,039
interesting person in general and i like

638
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,000
the fact that you

639
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,799
can go through his process and sort of

640
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,000
see that he never sort of

641
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,679
like don't get me wrong he knew he was

642
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,159
hacking the site but it was always oh

643
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,480
if i can do this can i do this and that

644
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,679
would be cool and fun

645
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,960
it was never a haha i i have full

646
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,640
control i can take over

647
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,760
um it was all just really quite silly

648
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,200
um and i don't know i don't know it's

649
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,640
always quite interesting to listen to

650
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,880
interviews with him because he always

651
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,320
talks about afterwards just sort of

652
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,000
realizing that he'd crash the site and

653
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,200
just being there like

654
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,400
oh shoot i should not have done that

655
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,039
which i don't know yeah i find it quite

656
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:09,679
interesting

657
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,159
so it's almost like the whole idea of

658
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,240
crime isn't it the mmo as they call it

659
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,240
in law enforcement circles

660
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,919
and in the middle end or the second m

661
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,320
in sami's case the the motivation wasn't

662
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,320
really anything malicious

663
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,720
as you described it was more around how

664
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,520
can i make this

665
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,320
do something a bit weird and not take

666
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,000
the site down which ultimately did

667
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,039
happen but

668
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,520
the motive wasn't to take down facebook

669
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,279
that peggy padden take down myspace at

670
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:37,919
the time

671
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,200
it was just can i do this and yeah

672
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,559
somebody commented i don't know whether

673
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:43,760
you've got a view on this ray but i

674
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,200
think somebody made a comment about him

675
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,640
getting arrested and

676
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,520
sent to jail did that happen uh no so

677
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,760
the fbi did come and raid his home

678
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,880
and i think he got it was either one or

679
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,640
two years with a lot of community

680
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,279
service so

681
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,960
something like 2000 hours community

682
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,720
service and

683
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,480
i think at the time he did get a

684
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,760
lifetime ban on ever using the internet

685
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,720
but he also i think it was after one or

686
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,440
two years

687
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,520
um they were like yeah your behavior has

688
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,679
been absolutely perfect since then

689
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,080
yeah go ahead go into that please don't

690
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,279
do something like that again

691
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,039
and then and then ultimately the

692
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,720
national security agencies start using

693
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,840
his software

694
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,840
yeah i really interesting

695
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,000
you know and i want to pivot on that one

696
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,960
because it's

697
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,679
like nowadays the climate for what

698
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,200
something like sammy

699
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,159
did would would i think go in a totally

700
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:37,679
different direction

701
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,640
it seems like you know the idea of sort

702
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,120
of the

703
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,840
fun and the pointing out you know in

704
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,679
kind of a humorous way that there's a

705
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:46,640
problem

706
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,400
but but now you know it feels like

707
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,600
the the uh law enforcement community

708
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,279
especially in the united states would

709
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,640
just like

710
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,840
absolutely crush uh uh

711
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,200
crush the person and and it sort of

712
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,600
it sends a bit of a chill i think

713
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,559
towards

714
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,919
the security research community where um

715
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,760
you know what your intent is you know

716
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,400
obviously you know when folks drop proof

717
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,840
of concepts

718
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,640
um on the internet you know ray do you

719
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,960
have an uh do you have maybe a sense of

720
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,640
you know things like responsible

721
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,120
disclosure and and bug bounties where do

722
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:27,679
you sit

723
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,440
on on that issue uh i think those are

724
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,000
really helpful to be honest there's um

725
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,120
there was another guy i

726
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,480
can't remember his name for the life of

727
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,720
me but he was also hacking when he was

728
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,559
younger like sammy but unlike sammy he

729
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,880
got into quite a lot of trouble for it

730
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,120
um ended up getting i think he got sent

731
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,520
to prison a number of times

732
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,919
and on one of the occasions the judge

733
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,600
said if i see you here again you'll get

734
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,679
a life sentence

735
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,760
at which point he was like okay i really

736
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,279
need to stop hacking

737
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,600
and then he found bug bounty programs

738
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,279
and found that he could hack

739
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,320
legally and get paid for it and that was

740
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,000
pretty much a lifesaver for him because

741
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,080
he was very addicted to hacking and

742
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,120
still is i believe

743
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,919
um so don't get me wrong i think those

744
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,240
are good i also

745
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,520
uh i don't think people who hack and

746
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,399
clearly don't

747
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:21,679
mean to cause harm i don't think that

748
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,320
they should be treated like criminals

749
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,919
because

750
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,840
i mean everyone's gotta learn somehow um

751
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,240
and

752
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,640
gotta break a few eggs to make a normal

753
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,760
it

754
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,960
so for me hacking has always been about

755
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,799
that inquisitive

756
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:41,360
perception um finding how something

757
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:41,919
works

758
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,159
tinkering with it figuring it out do you

759
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:45,600
think that's maybe why

760
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,440
um those with that kind of sort of

761
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,880
mindset make great

762
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,120
hackers um and why like they just

763
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,840
persevere in that kind of thing

764
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,679
yeah no definitely um like

765
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:59,919
it's why i had this section on hacking

766
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,440
at the beginning because it would just

767
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:01,840
be

768
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,000
people wanting to see how far their

769
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,960
virus could go

770
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,320
um there was one guy who

771
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,360
i think his virus got put on the malware

772
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,000
museum

773
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,279
i don't know if you've ever seen it but

774
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,559
it's quite fun to go and look at because

775
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,640
you get to see really old viruses

776
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,799
and like they're mostly just fun

777
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,559
animation type things

778
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,600
um and when interviewed and asked why

779
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,480
he'd ages ago written all these viruses

780
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,600
it was just that

781
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,440
he found it really cool that he'd

782
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,039
managed to get it halfway across the

783
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:31,520
world

784
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,120
when he was in this little remote

785
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,039
village with not that much contact with

786
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,200
other people

787
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,799
and mostly it's just people

788
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,799
at least to begin with it was definitely

789
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,480
just people curious about what they

790
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,120
could do

791
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,000
more than anything else

792
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,360
super well ray that is that is time

793
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,640
perfect timing yep all good um on behalf

794
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,679

796
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,640
