1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:05,359
so

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,639
we've got marios on next um so

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,679
marius uh welcome uh thanks for

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:12,880
attending he's gonna

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,679
take uh attack the cloud and take it

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,760
away

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,240
oh guys thank you for introduction so uh

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,279
my name is marius

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,320
uh and i've been um been working

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,720
best part of last ten years in um

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,080
physical security

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,560
and i decided to kind of combine my two

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,359
passions with

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,880
i.t and security and kind of transition

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,600
into

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,120
cyber security so um basically i'm gonna

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,239
be talking about

18
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,840
attack the cloud so basically might

19
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,480
attack framework within the cloud um

20
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,719
i'm going to discuss some common attacks

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,200
and how informed defense can help your

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,559
organizations so to start with

23
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,120
just a little story how the how the

24
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,960
basically the topic came about so

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,039
lately i have made a lot of friends

26
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,680
within kind of infosec

27
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,199
community and everyone's been really

28
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,479
helpful and helped me mentor and kind of

29
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,200
develop my skills so one of my mentors

30
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,560
um

31
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,360
basically kind of nudged me and said

32
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,360
next step in your development you should

33
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,200
kind of step outside your comfort zone

34
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,479
and maybe do a

35
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,759
do a webinar you know and um but i

36
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,680
i was like i don't really know what to

37
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,280
talk about so um

38
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,799
he just asked me basically what are you

39
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,400
passionate about and that's kind of the

40
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,920
last two topics that i've been really

41
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,600
working hard at was

42
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,320
you know cloud security and might have

43
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,439
frameworks so

44
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,960
he just said why don't you combine the

45
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,720
two of them and um and that's how that

46
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,280
basically the topic came about so

47
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,479
um without blabbing too much on um

48
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,159
i'm just gonna run through guys what i'm

49
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,240
gonna talk tonight um

50
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,799
so the schedule of the presentation is

51
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,000
gonna be so basically first

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,200
i'm going to introduce what what my

53
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,079
attack framework itself is um how it's

54
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,680
been basically developed what is all

55
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,159
about

56
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,560
and and basically how can it help your

57
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,079
organizations

58
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,280
uh then we move on to basically mitel

59
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,800
cloud framework that's developed

60
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,520
specifically for the cloud

61
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,160
i'm gonna run through um a few examples

62
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,800
of um

63
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,840
of common attacks in the cloud how how

64
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,319
what kind of procedures do adversaries

65
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,160
use and and basically how

66
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,160
you can reverse engineer your defenses

67
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,400
and how you can detect them as well

68
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,920
and then i'm going to move on to

69
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,840
basically your cloud infrastructure

70
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,440
security

71
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,360
and um how you can basically structure

72
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,360
your security and and i'm going to talk

73
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,440
through some of the best practices

74
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,440
in security securing your cloud

75
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,920
environment

76
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,280
so moving on first of all

77
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,959
what is might attack so might attack

78
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,720
basically is a framework is a

79
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,360
comprehensive kind of matrix of

80
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,560
tactics and techniques used by thread

81
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,360
hunters

82
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,480
red teamers and defenders basically to

83
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,519
better classify

84
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,560
attacks and to assess your

85
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,959
organization's risk um the aim of the

86
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,000
framework itself

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,120
is to provide post-compromise

88
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,920
detection of adversaries in enterprises

89
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,599
by illustrating these

90
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,280
actions an attacker may have taken

91
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,760
so i think kind of um the framework

92
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,720
itself helps

93
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,640
um organizations to answer one of the

94
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,720
two key questions basically

95
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,319
how did attacker get in and

96
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,560
how they are moving around so kind of

97
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,000
the knowledge is based

98
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,959
um kind of designed to help answer those

99
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,319
questions

100
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,400
while contributing to the awareness of

101
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,599
organizations

102
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,360
security posture at the perimeter

103
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,959
and beyond so organizations can use the

104
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,080
framework

105
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,799
to identify holes in defenses and

106
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,560
prioritize them based on risk

107
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,040
and also it's helpful for thread hunters

108
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,159
who can leverage the

109
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,840
attack framework to look for specific

110
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,319
techniques adversaries can use

111
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,319
uh in conjunct in conjunction with

112
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,519
others

113
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,599
the framework can be extremely useful

114
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,959
for gauging um

115
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,798
basically your environment's level of

116
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,600
visibility against targeted attacks

117
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,960
with existing tools deployed across your

118
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,840
organization

119
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,360
end points so

120
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,639
basically the the framework itself has

121
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,639
kind of three flavors that split into

122
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,360
kind of

123
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,240
three subcategories so you have one of

124
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,600
the most important and one of the main

125
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,000
ones

126
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,800
is um enterprise attack which basically

127
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,880
cloud is developed from that you have uh

128
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,919
then pre-attack

129
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,960
which covers um tactics um

130
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,040
and techniques uh basically used

131
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,400
pre-compromised so basically what

132
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,160
attackers would use before exploiting

133
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,360
the target

134
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,120
and then we have mobile attack which

135
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,400
basically a model for

136
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,280
adversarial tactics and techniques used

137
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,039
to gain

138
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,479
access to your mobile devices

139
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,240
so miter is basically a not profit

140
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,479
organization that supports several u.s

141
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:11,600
government

142
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,919
agencies began develop their framework

143
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,400
in 2013.

144
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,160
the framework which stands for

145
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,600
adversarial tactics

146
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,840
techniques and common knowledge was

147
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,880
released in

148
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,720
may 2015 and then sort of every quarter

149
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,800
is updated since

150
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,919
so we have 11 main tactics which i'm

151
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,360
going to expand into my next slide

152
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,720
but basically tactics is um

153
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,960
will help to answer the question why

154
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,400
adversaries are trying to get into your

155
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,120
infrastructure

156
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,479
and then each tactic can contain an

157
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:53,919
array of techniques

158
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,720
that have been observed being uh used in

159
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,319
a while by

160
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,960
either malware actor groups to

161
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,160
compromise your

162
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,160
infrastructure tactics are kind of um

163
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,680
probably will help more to answer

164
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,360
questions how

165
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,280
part of that attack and how attackers

166
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,919
are for example escalating privileges

167
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,680
um how adversaries um exfiltrating data

168
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,919
and so on so as i mentioned while there

169
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:20,800
are only

170
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,919
11 tactics there's oh by the time of

171
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,240
i'm talking now there's over 300

172
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,440
techniques that

173
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,880
adversaries can use um i think the best

174
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,360
way to kind of

175
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,319
visualize that is um if you jump into my

176
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,120
attack

177
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,840
website there is a navigator which kind

178
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,560
of uh

179
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,759
lists all your tactics and

180
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:44,880
which i'm going to show you in the

181
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,479
following slides as well but it's kind

182
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:47,199
of nifty

183
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,440
open source web app that allows

184
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,240
basically for

185
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,680
basic navigation uh and each technique

186
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,960
is um it has a code for it so it it

187
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,880
it starts with a t followed by four

188
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,039
numbers so for example spear phishing is

189
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:01,560
uh

190
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,840
t1192 and remote access tools is t1219

191
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,800
and so on basically kind of each

192
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,479
technique kind of gives you a contextual

193
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:11,440
information like

194
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,560
um permissions required what platform

195
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,840
technique has been used on

196
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,919
and basically how to detect those

197
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,599
commands and processes they basically

198
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,039
used in

199
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,919
um so and what are the procedures

200
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,199
basically so procedures

201
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,080
um as far as attack concern is describes

202
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,960
the way

203
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,000
adversaries or software implements a

204
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,960
particular technique

205
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,120
and then talking about basically threat

206
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,639
intelligence so

207
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,479
while the framework has been around for

208
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,400
for a number of years now um

209
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,120
i think it's especially caught on of

210
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,479
late

211
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,360
because the way it helps organizations

212
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:53,759
uh

213
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,680
and end users and government basically

214
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,520
share threat intelligence

215
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,360
well there are certainly kind of other

216
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,039
ways to share free intel

217
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,199
attack provides kind of common language

218
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,800
that's standardized

219
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,280
and globally accessible analysts can

220
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,520
structure um the intelligence

221
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,360
around the behavior while defenders can

222
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,360
structure information

223
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,759
around the behavior they can detect and

224
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,319
mitigate

225
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,000
and lastly i'm talking about basically

226
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,199
who does the attack framework benefit so

227
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,360
it benefits both it benefits red teamers

228
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,519
and blue team is alike so

229
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,719
for example it can aid red teams

230
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,719
can follow basically might as

231
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,958
adversarial emulation plans

232
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,200
and kind of test their network's

233
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,000
defenses

234
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,519
by modeling uh or emulating adversary

235
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,080
behavior

236
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,440
classified in attack framework so uh

237
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,320
and basically can kind of gauge

238
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,279
effectiveness

239
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,279
of um of defenses while blue teams can

240
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,320
kind of leverage

241
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,399
attack framework to get a better grip on

242
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,839
what adversaries are doing

243
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,839
and this way reverse engineer their

244
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,000
defenses

245
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,720
so jumping onto so that's the kind of

246
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,440
the matrix

247
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,560
and 11 tactics that are commonly used at

248
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,760
the moment so

249
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,399
we have initial access is basically how

250
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,320
adversaries will try and get into your

251
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,360
network

252
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,480
we have execution how they will try and

253
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,040
run your malicious code we have

254
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,240
persistence

255
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,720
how to maintain the foothold because

256
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,560
some of the malware might run

257
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,440
on for example memory and once you

258
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,080
restart your machine

259
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,519
the adversary is basically you can't get

260
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,440
back in so they will try and kind of

261
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,399
maintain a foothold within your system

262
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,920
privilege escalation so

263
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,920
how they can gain higher level level

264
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,839
permissions

265
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,560
evasion how they will try and avoid to

266
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,480
be detected

267
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,880
credential access so how they can steal

268
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,680
names and passwords

269
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,680
also discovery so how they will figure

270
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,279
out your environment

271
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,240
lateral movement as well so uh how they

272
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,760
will move for your environment

273
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,240
um collection so basically that covers

274
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,839
some gather of data

275
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,120
of interest to their goal we have then

276
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,959
commanding control so how they will

277
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,200
communicate with compromised systems to

278
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,399
control them

279
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,320
and exfiltration how they will try and

280
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,040
basically exfiltrate or steal data

281
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,399
and impact will basically talk about

282
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,240
manipulation interruption or how they

283
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,760
will destroy the data and

284
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,519
as you can see at the moment on the

285
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,800
right hand side there is

286
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,600
over 330 techniques at the moment seeing

287
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,160
so if if you guys want to have a look so

288
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,200
the first link is the link to my

289
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,800
miter attack website and the second link

290
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,640
basically is the link of the

291
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,240
um enterprise um framework uh talking

292
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,839
directly about the cloud itself

293
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,760
so that's how cloud matrix looks like

294
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,720
um as you can see at the top we have um

295
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,360
all

296
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,480
the 11 tactics

297
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,800
and then they are split into techniques

298
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,640
the ones you can see that has

299
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,880
kind of roman numerals next to them they

300
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,320
have some sub techniques

301
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,440
um and basically they can be kind of

302
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,040
split into

303
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,959
one or more kind of sub techniques that

304
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,720
adversaries can use

305
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,040
so i would like to run through a few

306
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,000
examples and

307
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,720
kind of few techniques that adversaries

308
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,920
can use so

309
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,440
if we look down at the initial access um

310
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,839
we'll be talking about how adversaries

311
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:38,800
can exploit

312
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,560
a public-facing application

313
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,959
so if um if you're on a website and on

314
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,800
that matrix and if you click on the

315
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,760
exploit public facing application it

316
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,839
will take you to a

317
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,760
basically a next website that looks

318
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,480
something like that

319
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,320
and as you can see on the right hand

320
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,519
side we have some

321
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,720
information that will give you um

322
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,959
an id number which is t1190

323
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,959
it will list if there's any techniques

324
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,480
and the tactic obviously is initial

325
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,240
access and then obviously

326
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,839
what's quite helpful as well it will

327
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,560
give you um a platforms that it has been

328
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,160
used before

329
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,120
so for example aws azure and and and the

330
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,639
rest

331
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,600
so um what is exploit public-facing

332
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,800
application so

333
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,600
um basically it's adversaries kind of

334
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,160
will try and attempt

335
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,079
uh or find the weakness basically in

336
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,560
your web app public facing web app

337
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,279
basically

338
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,560
and this can be anything from you know

339
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,760
sql databases um standard services like

340
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,959
smb or ssh you know network um kind of

341
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,720
administration and management tools like

342
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,399
snmp um and i think

343
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,079
especially um if we look at the next

344
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,240
slide which will help us as well so it

345
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,320
will explain for example

346
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,240
um for actors and what kind of

347
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,680
procedures they will use

348
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,560
um so we have a list of for example some

349
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,560
advanced persistent kind of groups that

350
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,160
um

351
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,959
work within the within the kind of um

352
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,360
how they kind of attack your defenses i

353
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,200
think where especially where

354
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,800
my attack framework shines um

355
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,920
you can you can do for example fire a

356
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,480
simple

357
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,519
search um depending on which kind of uh

358
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,120
industry you operate so for example if

359
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,040
you work within finance you can search

360
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,639
for specific um attack groups that

361
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,480
target finance group and that's how you

362
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,320
can basically reverse engineer your

363
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,360
defense so

364
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,680
a few examples for example apt-28 has

365
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,920
conducted a sequel injection attacks

366
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,680
against organizations external websites

367
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,079
and then you have something like axiom

368
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,920
has been observed you in sql

369
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,519
injection to gain access to your systems

370
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,199
so next one which is really helpful as

371
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:01,680
well

372
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,440
you have a list of mitigations and how

373
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,880
you can prevent from

374
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,839
um from adversaries gaining access

375
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,519
within your infrastructure so

376
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,959
you have a list on your left and then

377
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,480
you have some little descriptions so for

378
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,839
example you can use application

379
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:14,880
isolation and

380
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,839
sandboxing uh i think which is what's

381
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,600
really important um

382
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,240
network segmentation you know and

383
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,279
obviously

384
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,480
any public-facing web apps or or your

385
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,000
infrastructure should always be

386
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,839
regularly scanned

387
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,079
for vulnerabilities and then deploy

388
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:32,880
patches

389
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,000
to make sure they are up to date and

390
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,880
also

391
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,240
might attack helps you to detect

392
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,320
the principles of detection and how you

393
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,839
can

394
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,600
try and monitor this behavior so

395
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,920
one of the examples will be for example

396
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,839
monitor your application logs for

397
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,480
abnormal behavior

398
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,959
that may indicate any attempted uh or

399
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:57,600
successful

400
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,360
exploitation use deep packet inspection

401
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,480
and find kind of artifacts such as sql

402
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,480
injection and obviously

403
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,160
use web application firewalls

404
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,440
next tactic we're going to have to look

405
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,360
at is persistence

406
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,880
and how adversaries can manipulate

407
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,439
accounts

408
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,279
so if we go account manipulation again

409
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,399
as you can see there is um id number one

410
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:28,959
zero

411
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,040
nine eight and then you have four sub

412
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,720
techniques and and syntactic is

413
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,920
persistent so again

414
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,600
you have a list of platforms that it's

415
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,199
used for

416
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,399
and basically in this section it will it

417
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,079
will explain how adversaries

418
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,079
might you know manipulate accounts to

419
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,120
maintain

420
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,880
access um to victim systems

421
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,240
and basically how they will try and

422
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,839
motivate modifier credentials

423
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,120
sorry or permission groups

424
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,000
so there's a list of procedures that

425
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,040
they might use

426
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,920
so for example apt group three has been

427
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,600
known to add credential accounts to

428
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,600
local admin groups to maintain

429
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,839
elevated access and then i think

430
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,639
anyone who's done some red teaming

431
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:15,279
played

432
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,839
around with um hack the box or try hack

433
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:18,959
me will know

434
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,600
a tool called mimikatz so essentially

435
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,240
this is a

436
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,399
credential jumper has been used

437
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:25,759
basically to

438
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,199
kind of take the hashes

439
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,519
and and basically get into your accounts

440
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,199
without knowing the clear text value

441
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,399
so mitigations how we can mitigate these

442
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,440
kind of attacks so

443
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,000
um one of the most common mitigations

444
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,399
would be multi-factor authentication

445
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,560
so always make sure you know i think

446
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,199
some some

447
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,360
companies are known to use multi-factor

448
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,040
for admin accounts but i think

449
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,880
multi-factor should be used for

450
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,360
every single account to prevent any

451
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,800
problems like that

452
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,639
again you have network segmentation i

453
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,079
think where cloud where

454
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,319
cloud really shines you know within you

455
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,319
can create a multiple virtual private

456
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:06,880
clouds

457
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,280
um and kind of segment your network like

458
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,480
that

459
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,319
and obviously privileged account

460
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,839
management i think that's that's a key

461
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,679
point as well any admin accounts should

462
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,199
not be used for

463
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,400
for day-to-day uses

464
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,119
and then how we can detect this so um we

465
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:23,919
can collect

466
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,640
events and correlate them uh with

467
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,359
changes

468
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,200
you know to account objects or

469
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,640
permissions um

470
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,280
and then you have a list of um event ids

471
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,640
that you can monitor

472
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,640
you know any any kind of modification to

473
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,480
your accounts with correlation

474
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,640
like that can be very suspicious and

475
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,679
always should be looked at

476
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,440
next one um so defensive agent and how

477
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,840
adversaries can impair your defenses

478
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,440
so we have um seven sub techniques

479
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,400
um and kind of how you know adversaries

480
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,320
will maliciously try and modify

481
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,720
kind of components in order to kind of

482
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,400
hinder or

483
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,200
disable your defense mechanisms so that

484
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,480
can be you know such as

485
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,720
firewalls antivirus and kind of your

486
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,400
detection capabilities

487
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,440
that defenders would use

488
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,679
so here's the list of um kind of sub

489
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,120
techniques which kind of talks about the

490
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,120
same so but for example you can

491
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,600
then try and disable your cloud logs um

492
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,600
kind of indicator blocking

493
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,080
or you know disable and modify your

494
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,960
system firewall

495
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,480
so mitigations um i think

496
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,200
very important is kind of restrict your

497
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,320
file

498
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,360
and directory permissions um with the

499
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,160
you know

500
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,559
kind of without preventing interfering

501
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,320
with your you know security and logging

502
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,520
services

503
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,400
um i think um registry kind of uh

504
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,440
permissions as well

505
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,679
that's important thing to look at and

506
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:54,799
obviously make sure

507
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,280
um proper user permissions are in place

508
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,240
and you know

509
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,480
to prevent adversaries from disabling

510
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,919
this kind of logging device

511
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,360
logging services uh

512
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,360
and then detection so how we can detect

513
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,679
that so um i think it's key to monitor

514
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,679
processes and command line arguments

515
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,000
and then to see you know kind of any

516
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,880
security

517
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,799
tools or your logging services are

518
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,799
killed i think um

519
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,880
key aspect in that in terms of logs as

520
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,799
well if possible

521
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,000
try and kind of use your logs in um

522
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,480
in read-only memory so they can't be

523
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,080
they can't be altered

524
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,280
by any adversaries

525
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,240
and then the last exercise we can talk

526
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,200
about is

527
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,919
credential access and how um adversaries

528
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,200
can try and brute force that

529
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,320
so adversaries may brute force use a

530
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,679
kind of brute force techniques to gain

531
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,440
access to accounts when passwords are

532
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,559
basically unknown

533
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,120
or just you know hashes are obtained so

534
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,799
brute forcing is basically what means is

535
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:55,200
just

536
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,160
um adversaries trying to guess uh kind

537
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:58,480
of

538
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,559
passwords so trying or try and gain

539
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,559
hashes of your password so

540
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:07,200
and it comes with a id one um t110

541
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,480
and then um basically so procedures

542
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,840
um you have groups like apt-39 would use

543
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,240
um and correct to try and reveal your

544
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,360
credentials

545
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,400
and then fin5 has been known to to use a

546
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,559
tool called get 5 penetrator to look for

547
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:23,520
remote login

548
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,360
and hard coded credentials

549
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,280
so mitigations i think account use

550
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,480
policies so

551
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,039
kind of set lockout policies that's very

552
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:35,760
important

553
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,159
uh make sure you know after like five

554
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,080
unsuccessful logins you know account can

555
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,200
be locked out for

556
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,240
for for a certain amount of time um

557
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,000
you can use multi-factor authentication

558
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,360
as well and then

559
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,600
kind of um password policies i think

560
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,200
that's that's kind of a theory as well

561
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:51,919
so

562
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,840
kind of have long passwords i think

563
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,919
nowadays kind of guidelines go more from

564
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,240
used to be eight characters i think is

565
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,760
everyone's kind of trying to move to

566
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,039
12 characters upper lower cases numbers

567
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,360
and special characters and then again

568
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,039
user account management that comes in as

569
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:07,360
well

570
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,760
in here so detection how you can detect

571
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,880
that so again the

572
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,679
monitor authentication logs for your

573
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:16,159
system

574
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,039
and application login failures of um

575
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,799
valid accounts you know uh

576
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,000
and things like that you know uh you can

577
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,120
kind of um

578
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,280
authentication failures should always be

579
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,480
investigated

580
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,080
and you see whether it's some you know

581
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,000
legitimate users kind of forgetting your

582
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,760
passwords or there's something nefarious

583
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,000
going on

584
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,799
and then i will talk a bit and explain

585
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,159
about um

586
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,720
your defenses and how you can um how you

587
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,679
can improve your

588
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,400
security posture i think the first and

589
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,039
kind of

590
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,039
key area to understand is within the

591
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,640
cloud is

592
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,799
know what your organization and what are

593
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,720
you responsible for

594
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,600
so um moving from you know on premises

595
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,480
to the clouds

596
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,440
um we have a shared responsibility model

597
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:01,760
but

598
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,760
sometimes i think some some analysts or

599
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,320
some organizations don't really know

600
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,640
what they are protecting so for example

601
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,840
if we take an example

602
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,559
infrastructure as a service cloud

603
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:13,760
provider

604
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,000
actually are responsible for you know

605
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,520
for physical networks

606
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,200
servers uh and storage and hypervisors

607
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,360
but you are as organization you are

608
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,400
responsible for

609
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,799
virtual networks for operating systems

610
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,159
you have to make sure your

611
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,720
virtual machines are patched you are

612
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,880
responsible for applications and

613
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,440
any data within those applications uh or

614
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,280
anything that you store in your

615
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,559
in your storage devices

616
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,679
and people itself you know for example

617
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,280
identity and account management that's a

618
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,640
that's a big feature as well that you

619
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,799
are responsible for

620
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,640
and then once we move through models for

621
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,799
example like platform as a service

622
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,960
then um cloud provider will take a bit

623
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,799
more responsibility away from you so

624
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,000
they will take over

625
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,679
virtual networks and operating systems

626
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,000
so you're only responsible for your

627
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,039
applications and data and people and

628
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:05,760
then we move

629
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,760
into software as a service and then

630
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,280
cloud providers will take over

631
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,360
applications so you only left to secure

632
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,880
data

633
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,080
and people i think it's a key area to

634
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,600
understand and

635
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,440
and know what are you responsible and

636
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,360
what you need to secure to prevent

637
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,039
any problems within your cloud

638
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,600
infrastructure

639
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,799
if we move on again you know kind of key

640
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,200
three points how to kind of secure your

641
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,230
cloud infrastructure i think some some

642
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,360
[Music]

643
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,440
security analysts might forget but you

644
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,200
know data protection is key you have to

645
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,880
secure your data

646
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,000
that is um stored locally that's you

647
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,320
know

648
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,440
uh is in transit as well and you know in

649
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:49,840
all

650
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,960
in all areas that it's moved

651
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,279
i think where data protection comes in

652
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,679
in places is very important you know

653
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,120
and then in the cloud again security

654
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,600
hygiene still still matters you know

655
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,640
security cloud providers i mean they

656
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,279
have

657
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,480
developed a large number of tools to

658
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,440
help you you know

659
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,159
um to improve your security hygiene you

660
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,440
know from going from

661
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,240
azure for example they have a security

662
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,640
center which gives you a kind of a score

663
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,279
and um and explains you know gives you

664
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,520
kind of recommendations how you can

665
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,159
improve your defenses and always you

666
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:26,720
have to

667
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,520
make sure you improve your visibility so

668
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,039
make sure

669
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,679
you um kind of turn on all the logging

670
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:34,080
you know

671
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,120
it comes from health of your machines

672
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,880
through network logging and anything

673
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,240
that's going on within your

674
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,919
infrastructure which i think is very

675
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,200
helpful because you can

676
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,320
feed that into into cm tools and and

677
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,240
analytical tools and see what's going on

678
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,200
within your

679
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,559
infrastructure itself

680
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,600
so uh again one of the key areas i think

681
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,159
is

682
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,200
identity and access management so this

683
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,000
is kind of a

684
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,279
a list of um of kind of um

685
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,760
top eight uh kind of clouds and im

686
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,799
practices so

687
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,919
um defend uh define first line defenses

688
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:10,640
so i think

689
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,360
you have to start with um at the very

690
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,080
first beginning

691
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,480
you know i think as a key area as well

692
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,840
is use um

693
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,600
central uh centralized identity

694
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,919
management so if you have on-premises

695
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,360
um active directory you can move that

696
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,039
into the cloud you know and and

697
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,600
combine that all in one and make sure

698
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,320
enable

699
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,600
single sign-on you know enable um

700
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,440
conditional access so for example you

701
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,039
know if you have your

702
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:41,120
for example uh devops team they work in

703
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,120
nine to five monday to friday they

704
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,799
should not have access

705
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,120
at seven p.m because they might not they

706
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,720
might not be in the office so

707
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,320
things like that you know you can always

708
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,760
prevent and help secure

709
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,360
you know enable multi-factor

710
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,200
amplification um

711
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,600
use role-based access control i think

712
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,720
that's key as well

713
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,520
instead of defining how access is given

714
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,440
from a counter account

715
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,799
um group um same uh people who work in

716
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,240
the same function

717
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,159
put them onto one group and and define

718
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:11,760
their permissions that way

719
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,799
limit privileged accounts and you know

720
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:18,080
um turn on active identity monitoring

721
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,760
which is which is very key in kind of um

722
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,840
bolstering up your defenses

723
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,000
um and this is a kind of a cloud

724
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,520
security model

725
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,919
that we can look at uh and it kind of

726
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:34,880
explains your

727
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,240
what you need to look at within your

728
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,320
infrastructure your people

729
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,320
and the data that you need to secure you

730
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,840
know things like encryption

731
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,880
data discovery you have authentication

732
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,440
and um logical segmentation and things

733
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,960
like that

734
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,679
um what i would like to talk next as

735
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:52,320
well

736
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,159
is um kind of a two areas of kind of

737
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,120
drawbacks i think

738
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,880
um a big problem within cloud is

739
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,279
um is user error configuration and kind

740
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,360
of one of the most

741
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,600
common exposures uh it's kind of

742
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,799
believed to be the root cause of

743
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:09,600
incidents of

744
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,120
up to like 97 by 2022

745
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,200
for example i think there's common uh

746
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,279
things that been revealed recently about

747
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,080
you know in aws s3 buckets that

748
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,559
a large portion of organizations left

749
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:23,360
them wide open

750
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,080
and data has been exfiltrated in that

751
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,279
way so you need to make sure

752
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,480
you secure those those buckets and make

753
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,679
sure they don't have

754
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,720
public-facing access and again

755
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,039
as organizations move to kind of working

756
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,799
from home

757
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,640
there is a lack of endpoint security so

758
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,159
you need to make sure you

759
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,279
kind of employ the best um edr tools

760
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,200
uh and kind of monitor all of your

761
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,880
endpoints you know especially

762
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,240
thinking about you know bring your own

763
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,919
devices and things like that that's

764
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:53,120
that's kind of a key

765
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,480
area to to focus on and and bolster your

766
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,720
defenses

767
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,000
and lastly um it's kind of essential

768
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,559
eight security controls um i think where

769
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:05,520
sometimes

770
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,640
some um analysts can go wrong

771
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,799
for example for web apps they'll try and

772
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,039
do a blacklist and i think it's very

773
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,000
hard to

774
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,840
to kind of find all the lists of bad

775
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,440
things that can happen so

776
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,600
instead i think um you should be using

777
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,200
whitelisting and only

778
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,320
kind of um list the acceptable

779
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,480
um kind of entries that your application

780
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,480
should um

781
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,480
should accept um you should patch your

782
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,919
applications um

783
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,640
configure microsoft office macros you

784
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,399
know kind of user application hardening

785
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:37,919
and then how you can basically limit

786
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,200
those attacks so

787
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,080
restrict admin privileges make sure you

788
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,399
patch your operating systems

789
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:45,760
uh you know use multi-factor

790
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,480
notification and then lastly you know

791
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,559
how you can recover that data and you

792
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:51,520
know kind of

793
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,520
how your system availability works make

794
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,799
sure you use daily

795
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,640
backups and then that's it you know guys

796
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,399
um thank you for listening uh it's been

797
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,000
a pleasure you know to talk about the

798
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,559
kind of

799
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,360
two two of my passions and um i would

800
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,000
welcome

801
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,360
any questions i know there's probably

802
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,039
not much time left but

803
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,919
you know um you have things like slack

804
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:12,960
or you know

805
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,240
and you can contact me in there

806
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,200
marius that was awesome thanks very much

807
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,399
there is one

808
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:23,200
question we do have time to to run it by

809
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,559
you if you're cool with that

810
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,720
yeah it's kind of it's kind of a two

811
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,480
people had the exact same thought at the

812
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,240
same time it seems

813
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,679
um so this is from tim and hill nolly

814
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,919
via twitch uh does mitre have a

815
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:38,880
prioritization methodoly

816
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,480
methodology like pci dss it could take

817
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,399
months if not years to action these

818
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:45,200
steps

819
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,279
uh oh and by the way great talk because

820
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,760
their comment so yeah yeah

821
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,960
well i think it's kind of um you have to

822
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,080
kind of look at at

823
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,240
the at the framework itself and as i

824
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,240
mentioned kind of in my in my talk

825
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,200
um you kind of have to look at because

826
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,880
the way mitre works as well which kind

827
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,679
of helps

828
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,320
you can you can search for organizations

829
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,000
and for example your

830
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,039
your kind of um where your

831
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,600
way you working in what environment so

832
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,799
for example if you're working within

833
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,960
finance it gives you

834
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,520
the exact kind of um apts that work

835
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,200
within finance and what they're trying

836
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:21,760
to

837
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,919
kind of infiltrate and then i think you

838
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,080
have to look at your own infrastructure

839
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:26,559
so

840
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,000
some of the maybe techniques and some of

841
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,600
the tactics might not

842
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,960
um kind of work in your environment so

843
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,679
um you have to look at and then kind of

844
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:36,159
work

845
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:37,840
work your way down and then i think you

846
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,440
have to look at the

847
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,840
kind of risk matrix what what is what is

848
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,840
the most important for your organization

849
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,039
and how you will

850
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:47,360
secure that and work kind of backwards

851
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,960
and see where you know whether you can

852
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,000
transfer some of the risk

853
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,520
where you whether you can accept some of

854
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,960
the risk and what you need to to

855
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,279
mitigate

856
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,000
