7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,279
um we're just gonna go through some of

8
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,800
the uh stuff that we did yesterday

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,359
morning

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,599
um warm people up a little bit perhaps

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,680
just let's share a stat we had 17

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,119
speakers yesterday um

13
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,560
that didn't include our little panel

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,558
talk mid-morning um

15
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:36,320
we had 1107 unique visitors

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,800
on the fantastic on the twitch stream

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,840
which

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,480
you're kind of talking pretty big

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,120
numbers

20
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,640
i mean that's on par with the footfall

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,120
you'd expect a big b sides uk b

22
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,480
sides anyway so a staggering number of

23
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,160
people turned up and uh i'd like to

24
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,520
think that they were all really

25
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,520
well entertained by the quality of the

26
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,440
the talks that they saw

27
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,840
um we think on average each speaker got

28
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,280
around about 100

29
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,040
participants per talk so

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,880
really good the quality of the talks was

31
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,240
astonishingly high it was

32
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,400
excellent you know um i wouldn't want to

33
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,000
pick a favorite if i'm perfectly honest

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,040
i thought they were all

35
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,119
equal par in terms of quality and that's

36
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,560
a testament to the people that delivered

37
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,759
the talks and

38
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,840
produced them in the first place um and

39
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,880
also the support

40
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,720
that they had from the mentoring team so

41
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,159
all their individual mentors that they

42
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,600
reached out to so well done

43
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,640
really well done um

44
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,240
not going to go through the stuff all

45
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,439

46
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,799

99
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,760
day yesterday we expect it to be equally

100
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,480
as super

101
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,519
today be absolutely fantastic um that's

102
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:20,319
it from me

103
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,280
chaps do you want to add anything sure

104
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,879
i'll jump in on a couple of things

105
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,040
so it was really really interesting to

106
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,319
see um

107
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,080
a bunch of different diverse talks on

108
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,480
different information security subjects

109
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,040
i'd have to say that my favorite was

110
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,080
reyes from

111
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,120
uh inc uh not inclusive inversive

112
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,080
networks right

113
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,440
invasive networks labs okay

114
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,360
um yeah no that one was really

115
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,360
interesting and i i think i liked it

116
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,519
because it just started off at

117
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,680
my space which is something that was big

118
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,799
when i was in

119
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,959
information security and kind of moved

120
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,560
forward from there

121
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,480
so a lot of nostalgia but a lot of

122
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,560
interest in the fact that you know

123
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,159
you know sean can attest to the fact

124
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,400
that we've come so far yet we've gone

125
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,159
nowhere uh you know these that these

126
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:08,879
persistent

127
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,480
type uh bugs um you know started off

128
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,879
sort of curiosity started off with the

129
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:15,439
idea

130
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,560
of of kind of demonstrating uber hacking

131
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,600
skills and then

132
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,160
turned into weaponized and and payloads

133
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,880
you know

134
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,440
and and that's that's unfortunate uh i

135
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,440
think my second favorite talk was on

136
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,560
ipv6

137
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,520
uh something that uh we have been living

138
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,360
with for a while and in fact is the

139
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,639
default protocol

140
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,680
on windows 7 boxes moving forward

141
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,919
so you know to learn more about that and

142
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,520
to learn about some of the security

143
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,199
issues associated with that was

144
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,080
uh was really interesting and in terms

145
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,880
of preview

146
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,880
i would be remiss and not saying that

147
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,320
bushido token

148
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,560
uh one of our security researchers that

149
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,880
sajax is going to do an amazing job

150
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,600
today

151
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,479
no pressure will um and uh yeah i'll be

152
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:01,440
meeting up with will

153
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,840
later on today uh to uh to debrief him

154
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,240
i i really wasn't his mentor other than

155
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,199
to say

156
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,840
uh to him that he's got great valuable

157
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,120
research and he

158
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,320
shouldn't [ __ ] it up fair what more

159
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,160
encouragement could he possibly ask for

160
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,160
exactly really some good advice for life

161
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,280
to be fair you know

162
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,639
yeah absolutely right um

163
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,240
yeah yeah so i mean just i

164
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,520
i i agree with ian um and i said it and

165
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,479
and stream yesterday i said it and slack

166
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:37,120
channel

167
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,240
um there's some stuff that i've just

168
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,560
neglected throughout the years like ipv6

169
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,120
or

170
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,199
kerberos or anything like that any hack

171
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,520
the box that's kerberos based

172
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,840
i just you know it's just going to be a

173
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,280
pain for me to learn

174
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,360
i sat through 25 or 20 to 30 minute talk

175
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,360
and now i'm hooked now i'm like hey i

176
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,280
can't i actually understand this this is

177
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,479
accessible to me

178
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,400
this is presented in a really good way

179
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,639
it's really straightforward

180
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,280
massive shout out to the kerberos talk

181
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,080
from yesterday

182
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,120
i'm doing a live demo of that magnitude

183
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,280
twice um and jumping between different

184
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,199
boxes on a home lab

185
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,319
when your home lab you know is just you

186
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,759
know what's going to go wrong in the day

187
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:20,560
and it didn't

188
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,280
um a massive kudos to that balls the

189
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,880
size of melons i think i said yesterday

190
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,440
and i think

191
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,880
that still sticks today uh that's gutsy

192
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,199
super gutsy it's gutsy we've all done

193
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,639
live demos of simple things and have

194
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,440
gone wrong

195
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,199
um and this guy's doing you know

196
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,120
kerberos level stuff and jumping

197
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,440
into cali box and moving things around

198
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,639
like

199
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,080
if i tried that everything would just

200
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,160
die but um no

201
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,639
high quality talks absolutely fantastic

202
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,160
every single person we've got high

203
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,759
quality talks today

204
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,039
um i don't think a single person had

205
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,080
ego yesterday everybody was amazing and

206
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,199
everybody jumped into the kind of we had

207
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,560
a bit of a chat with them afterwards

208
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,160
we're all super super cool super

209
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,680
friendly

210
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,000
that we need more of that oh great

211
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,919
one one of the other comments that was

212
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,919
made yesterday um

213
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,080
kind of after all the talks and that is

214
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,000
the the constant vibe that was just

215
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,880
flowing through the twitch stream chats

216
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,599
slack

217
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,319
and that just shows the engagement that

218
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:22,800
the

219
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,680
talk created and to me that that is just

220
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,360
something that all the speakers should

221
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:27,599
be

222
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,680
really proud of i like every single one

223
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,599
of them should be

224
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,840
really proud of what they have done i

225
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,840
have no doubt that the speakers today

226
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,800
will

227
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,400
do exactly the same and like everyone

228
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,240
who's taken part should be extremely

229
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,360
proud of themselves

230
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,560
it's it's something that i think i

231
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,680
certainly would like to see

232
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,599
happen again um and yeah just

233
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,560
massive kudos to everyone involved yeah

234
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,520
100

235
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,840
completely agree um the last thing i

236
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,039
think before we let you all go and get a

237
00:07:59,039 --> 00:07:59,520
coffee

238
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,000
is uh the videos for the talks from

239
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,039
yesterday are now

240
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,879

241
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,840
sean um so you can tell scott didn't

242
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,120
didn't spend a lot of time

243
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,599
sleeping overnight um so what we're

244
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,039
going to do is we're going to get those

245
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,479
up on youtube

246
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:17,919
probably some at some point today and

247
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,680
what i'm going to do is i'm going to

248
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,639
link

249
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,319
not just the youtube stuff we'll do that

250
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,000
we'll publish the youtube links when

251
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,639
they're up

252
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,080
but what i'm going to do this morning is

253
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,400
send each of the yesterday's speakers

254
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,639
um a link to their mp3 uh their mp4 a

255
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,479
buggy power file so they've actually got

256
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,479
the original file as well that they can

257
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,240
use to the heart's content so

258
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,559
that's today and that was a reflection

259
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,279
on yesterday

260
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,519
so go get yourself a drink go do

261
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,720
whatever you want to do and we'll see

262
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,640
you back here at 9 30.

263
