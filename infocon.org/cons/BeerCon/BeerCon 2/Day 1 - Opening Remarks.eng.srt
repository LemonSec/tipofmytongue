fantastic thank you for the interest

53
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,680
chaps so

54
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,560
why bear con 2 why are we here well we

55
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,479
did bear call one last year in december

56
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,360
and become one was a 24 hour in fact it

57
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,280
was a 26 and a half hour

58
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,160
marathon that we did principally um for

59
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,080
fundraising and we raised a good few

60
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,599
thousand pounds each for

61
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,760
the electronic frontier foundation and

62
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,520
um mental health hackers

63
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,560
so that was a really worthwhile pursuit

64
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,879
um but that was a little bit different

65
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,400
because predominantly

66
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,080
the majority of the speakers were people

67
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,520
that you probably already knew

68
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,440
okay and people have been long-standing

69
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,879
in the industry

70
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,840
probably people you've seen at

71
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,760
conferences and all that kind of stuff

72
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,560
um

73
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,160
but with baercon2 we came up with a

74
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,160
slightly different plan

75
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,840
we we were all going to go and attend

76
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,760
conferences in 2020 that was pretty much

77
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,959
everyone's plan um

78
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,480
the bear farmers had many plans to go

79
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,239
and deliver some talks

80
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,080
and that kind of got messed up right by

81
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,000
that thing that we will not name

82
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,800
so early in the day and it meant that a

83
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,440
lot of people that had talks planned

84
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,360
uh simply just couldn't deliver them

85
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,040
because the conferences were cancelled

86
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,800
a couple went virtual but the majority

87
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,080
of the other conferences particularly

88
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,760
b-sides and the like in the uk

89
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,440
unfortunately had to be postponed

90
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,200
indefinitely and that was really

91
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,200
unfortunate but we knew

92
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,920
that quite a lot of um new speakers had

93
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,280
applied and been successful and have

94
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,879
their talks accepted

95
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,040
so we thought well why not just try and

96
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,640
give those people an opportunity to get

97
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,120
the talk

98
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,760
done in front of a fresh audience we do

99
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,760
it virtually and yes we accept it's not

100
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,040
quite the same as standing up in a room

101
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,920
full of strangers

102
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,000
but it's still a platform and it's still

103
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,680
a chance for individuals new to public

104
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,640
speaking to actually

105
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,720
go ahead and do do some of that stuff so

106
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,480
everybody i think or at least the vast

107
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,519
majority of the people that you're going

108
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:37,920
to be

109
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,280
hearing from and seeing over the next

110
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,120
couple of days have not given public

111
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,920
talks

112
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,319
previously so this is their opportunity

113
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,360
to come out and do that

114
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,799
in front of a new audience but in safe

115
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:49,280
hands

116
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,440
around the people cast and crew that are

117
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,760
supporting this project for us

118
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,120
um we've got a schedule of around 29 30

119
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,760
speakers

120
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,360
if you saw that super cool video could

121
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,120
give you a little bit of the detail

122
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,640
um across two days so we start

123
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,400
now and then we finish probably later on

124
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,920
this evening and then tomorrow we go

125
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,560

152
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,320
viewing us you're watching us on twitch

153
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,000
so that's great so that's beer con

154
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,199
dot tv forward slash watch okay

155
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,240
but you already know that because you're

156
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,960
here listening to us um

157
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,800
the recordings of all the talks will be

158
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,639
edited post conference

159
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,320
and we'll get them up onto youtube as

160
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,240
soon as we can probably over the next

161
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,960
three or four weeks um but certainly

162
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,240
before the end of the year you'll have

163
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:16,960
your talk

164
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,400
and that we're hoping for the speakers

165
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,000
is the main takeaway from this it's

166
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,199
something that you've then got that you

167
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:21,680
can

168
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,039
say i did that and you can stick it in

169
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,400
your portfolio of work and hopefully

170

all right and i'm going to start with

193
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,960
our mentoring team so without even being

194
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,919
asked we had

195
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,160
a bunch of really cool people um

196
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,280
volunteer their time

197
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,560
and have really made a difference to

198
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,400
this and um

199
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,080
soothed and calmed the nerves of the

200
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,600
speakers you know if it's the first time

201
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,639
you're doing this kind of thing you're

202
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:29,759
going to be probably

203
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,440
a bit worried about it being a success

204
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,120
you don't want to make a mess of it

205
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,800
and i specifically want to thank claire

206

262
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,479
lot with the community

263
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:31,919

264
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,479

265
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,080

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,680
donate my time

284
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,920
in a different time zone for other

285
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,399
people and sit here and do dry run after

286
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,640
dry run and donate zoom licenses for

287
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,279
them to just test stuff out themselves

288
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,720
we built a little community and they've

289
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,640
just taken on board

290
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,640
this is what infosec is about in your

291
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,240
absolute spot on but we've had we've got

positive and it

296
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,519

at twitter and you still hear oh and for

298
