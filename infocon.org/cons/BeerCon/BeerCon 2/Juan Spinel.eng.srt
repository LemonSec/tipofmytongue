1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,120
all right

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,919
thanks for uh coming back and thanks for

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,080
joining us um we're back from a break

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,200
with our very next speaker one

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,759
spinel um and he's going to be talking

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,039
all about gdpr

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,640
gdpr good intentions bad implementation

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,000
ugly loopholes take it away everyone

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,800
hello i'm juan and i will be talking to

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,840
you today about

11
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,920
gdpr so i worked for

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,640
close to three years in it for luxury

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,239
hospitality

14
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,440
during that time we had the gdpr go live

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,680
had to implement the compliance strategy

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,360
from corporate

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,600
develop internal procedures to maintain

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,399
compliance across all departments

19
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,199
in my case key stakeholders were hr for

20
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,320
employee data

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,120
and marketing for the clients other

22
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:55,920
industries

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,719
other business cases operations may have

24
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,120
higher stakes

25
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,319
some definitions pms property management

26
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,438
system

27
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,720
this is the erp for hospitality

28
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,960
designed from the ground up to help

29
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,560
hotels

30
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,000
pii personally identifiable information

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,600
anything that can be linked back to a

32
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,840
specific person for example

33
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,360
through their name phone number email

34
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,360
data affect information

35
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,079
usually aggregated data which provides

36
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,679
together some added value

37
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,040
today we'll be talking about gdpr so

38
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,159
what gdpr aims to combat where the

39
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,520
implementations fell short

40
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,840
on the technical side as well as

41
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,159
legislative side

42
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,439
two loopholes one which limits well

43
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,399
the extent to which gdpr can be enforced

44
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:52,799
and

45
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,880
a second loophole which i have seen

46
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,280
vendors abuse to sell their product

47
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,079
without ensuring compliance i'll be

48
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,920
finishing with

49
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,479
well some ways to handle compliance from

50
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:05,840
three perspectives

51
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,560
and a couple horror stories thrown in it

52
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,200
is halloween

53
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,239
so gdpr for those who might not know

54
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,040
it is a set of regulations that specify

55
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,200
companies responsibilities with regards

56
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:19,760
to

57
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,879
customer data it is a text of law

58
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,800
written by lawyers and as you can

59
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,080
imagine

60
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,040
i am not a lawyer this made interpreting

61
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,720
the requirements within our business

62
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,440
case

63
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,319
a nightmare all those years ago the

64
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,440
scope of gdpr

65
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,120
is of course the residents of the

66
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,480
european union

67
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,280
visitors to the european union and any

68
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,480
company that wishes to

69
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,280
have business with these people needs to

70
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,319
ensure their compliance

71
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,480
so following two decades

72
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,360
one could argue three of increasingly

73
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,239
large

74
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,720
websites announcing data breaches where

75
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,599
the companies just

76
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,000
shrug it off to well cost of doing

77
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,360
business

78
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,239
you have also the data misuse and abuse

79
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,360
scandals

80
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,239
which once again companies shrug off to

81
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,319
the cost of doing business

82
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,200
gdpr provides a framework to hold

83
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,800
companies accountable for

84
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,800
how they secure the data how they use it

85
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,680
and what data they are holding node

86
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,920
worthy data misuse case would be

87
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,920
2014 uber incident where a journalist

88
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,360
was followed through their

89
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,680
interface up until her interview with

90
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,519
one of the uber executives

91
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,120
of course this was completely against

92
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,120
company policy

93
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,959
equally important and still making

94
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,159
headlines today

95
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,799
2016 with cambridge analytica

96
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,519
additionally gdpr provides residents of

97
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:50,879
the european union

98
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,200
or people visiting the european union

99
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,080
with

100
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,959
the right of forcing companies to remove

101
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,400
public facing data

102
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,120
which misrepresents them the poster

103
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,560
shout out for this is of course mario

104
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,799
costello versus google

105
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,840
for anyone who doesn't know the story

106
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,560
some years ago mario costeja had some

107
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,560
financial troubles

108
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,879
he overcame those troubles but his life

109
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:15,680
didn't quite

110
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,320
turn around he did some research and

111
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,440
found the first

112
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,960
results when googling himself was

113
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,000
these financial troubles of the past

114
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,960
mario went to google multi-million

115
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,759
dollar company

116
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,560
mario one guy in spain google didn't do

117
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,680
anything

118
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,800
mario once again went to google google

119
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,759
once again

120
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,240
didn't do anything mario had to take

121
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,680
this up with

122
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,840
courts in spain and europe which led to

123
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,240
this being one of the key cases in the

124
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,479
right to be forgotten

125
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,560
leaving mario as the poster child when

126
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,759
all he wanted was

127
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,040
to be forgotten

128
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,160
so gdpr provides the residents of the

129
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,199
european union

130
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,720
people visiting the european union with

131
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,400
several rights

132
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,440
it is aimed primarily at the tech

133
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,720
industry i am providing this with a

134
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,160
services industry perspective

135
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,400
not all rights are pertinent you

136
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,680
wouldn't go to a hotel

137
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,280
requesting your data to give it to

138
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,840
another hotel

139
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,520
these four which i'm going to explain

140
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,880
will provide a good baseline

141
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,120
for any services industry business

142
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,639
you have the right to request your data

143
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,639
to be deleted from active use by the

144
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,759
company

145
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,000
your right to be forgotten you can

146
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,240
request for your data to be amended

147
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,759
in this case typically you'll be a

148
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,320
change in the means to reach you

149
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,000
your preferences the right of correction

150
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,600
you remain the owner of any data

151
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,120
generated through your interactions with

152
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,240
the business

153
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,759
for example you go to a hotel when safe

154
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,840
when travel is safe again

155
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,240
in the evening you go to the restaurant

156
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,759
of course you don't pay it gets billed

157
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:58,880
to your room

158
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,400
and then you go to the bar and get a

159
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,800
couple of beers again you don't pay

160
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,759
they get built to your room these

161
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:06,720
transactions

162
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,039
are generating data points which are

163
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,400
linked to your reservation

164
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,199
which are back again linked to you

165
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,080
technically

166
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,600
you are the owner of this information

167
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,000
you have finally the right to restrict

168
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,680
how your data

169
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,080
is processed within the business how it

170
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,000
is used with other partners

171
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,400
for marketing purposes your explicit

172
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,599
consent is required

173
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,440
so after the good intentions

174
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,039
let's see where the tech industry failed

175
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,039
this should remem remind everyone of the

176
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,120
internet circa june 2018

177
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,440
now these cookie banners in particular

178
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,199
come from tech giants

179
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,919
twitter and linkedin companies with

180
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,160
compliance teams

181
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,479
these banners however fail at the

182
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:57,360
compliance

183
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,599
given that users are unable to revoke

184
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,319
acceptance of cookie based tracking

185
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,240
you might think oh yes but juan these

186
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,960
are from june 2018

187
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,199
sadly these two in particular were

188
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,000
spotted in

189
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,680
earlier october 2020.

190
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,199
this banner technically compliant

191
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,039
execution fails

192
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,199
after accessing the settings page and

193
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,039
disabling cookies

194
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,880
returning to the homepage also reloaded

195
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,160
the banner

196
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,120
leaving the user in an endless loop

197
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,319
slightly more 2019

198
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,479
this banner lacks accessibility for less

199
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,520
tech savvy users

200
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,240
or people with site impediments due to

201
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,000
the high contrast buttons

202
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,919
people after all want to get to the text

203
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,080
behind the banners

204
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,759
i have seen websites where this type of

205
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,120
banner

206
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,199
the deselect all button did not remove

207
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,639
all of the tracking cookies

208
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,440
these had to be removed manually if you

209
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,560
are showing this to

210
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,120
friends family or colleagues it's

211
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,960
important to explain the risks to their

212
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,680
privacy

213
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,440
on not verifying that all cookies are

214
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,759
disabled

215
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,560
finally to finish on a good note this

216
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,759
has been my

217
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,879
favorite solution to dates

218
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,199
this solution provides an easy to use

219
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,960
interface

220
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,120
i was able to verify through the

221
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,240
advanced settings that

222
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,319
all tracking cookies weren't indeed

223
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,759
disabled

224
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,759
and additionally this implementation

225
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,840
uses a persistent cookie

226
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,000
such that the next visit of the website

227
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,360
does not require going through the

228
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,880
process again

229
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,200
be that next week three months six

230
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,120
months

231
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,760
sadly however these banners led to the

232
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,958
normalization of

233
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,279
clicking random links which is of course

234
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,560
an infosec nightmare

235
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,839
now on the legislative side as mentioned

236
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,040
before gdpr is a tax of law

237
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,760
compared to technical standards it fails

238
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,720
to provide

239
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,959
baselines pci compliance for example

240
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,560
so pci dss provides

241
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,800
technical requirements in non-technical

242
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,399
terms which means

243
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,440
anyone in the business can quickly

244
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,959
make a checklist without needing half

245
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,440
the i t department

246
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,560
for example installing configuring and

247
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,880
maintaining a firewall

248
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,000
not using default credentials encrypting

249
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,920
data as it moves between

250
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,680
systems developing and maintaining

251
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,760
secure applications arguably not

252
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,519
applicable for the services industry

253
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,600
but good to keep in mind but critically

254
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,720
regular security audits

255
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,839
now of course a services business

256
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,040
will not meet all these requirements

257
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,839
after all they are not developing these

258
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,120
kind of applications

259
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,360
however they would only be able to

260
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,240
process

261
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,640
credit card information if it's coming

262
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,080
from certified vendors

263
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,600
now gdpr lacks the technical baselines

264
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,040
it is a text of law where many articles

265
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,360
are open to interpretation

266
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,279
this leaves businesses in unsteady

267
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,920
waters with regards to their compliance

268
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,839
especially in regards to

269
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,680
how they are sharing data with other

270
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,760
partners or even within the business

271
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,320
some elements do provide specifics

272
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,720
however this is usually in the recital

273
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,560
which technically are not part of the

274
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,640
law

275
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,240
again not helping additionally

276
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,560
as opposed to stating some baseline

277
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,320
security investments

278
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,720
or requirements whether they be in-house

279
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,399
or outsourced

280
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,600
gdpr texts refer to state of the art

281
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,959
when referring to security

282
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,599
infrastructure

283
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,560
now that means a company can only

284
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,160
demonstrate compliance

285
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,480
by getting more and more blinky boxes

286
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,600
every year

287
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,360
without actually configuring or

288
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,360
monitoring them because

289
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,240
of course the new blinky boxes are the

290
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,959
state of the art

291
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,240
hopefully future iterations of the

292
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,680
regulations

293
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,480
new regulations across the world will

294
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,800
address these shortcomings

295
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,760
leading to increased privacy for well

296
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,480
constituents of the eu

297
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,839
and citizens of the world

298
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,680
so small horror story

299
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,440
this is me circa april 2018

300
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,880
i'm stressing out because i need to

301
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,079
figure out if i'm compliant

302
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,320
and of course lots of companies are

303
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,079
calling up to say hey

304
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,920
we can offer you on gdpr compliance

305
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,040
three companies actually seem to provide

306
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,000
something

307
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,480
interesting so they came in to discuss

308
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,639
their product

309
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,320
it turns out what they were offering was

310
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,880
um customer relationship management

311
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,000
tool meaning i would be having my

312
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,120
data sent off to a different company not

313
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,240
sure how they were going to be doing

314
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,040
that

315
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,360
essentially one more point of failure

316
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,800
i have since found out two of these

317
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,040
three companies have gone bankrupt

318
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,399
following gdpr fines so

319
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,519
if people say they're selling compliance

320
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,320
look away folks

321
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:33,120
now as storage and computing power get

322
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,160
cheaper

323
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,120
it becomes increasingly easy to store

324
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,959
for longer periods of time

325
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,399
and process data for business purposes

326
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,880
with little oversight this generates pii

327
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,639
in uncontrolled amounts

328
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,519
often on less secure infrastructure and

329
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,040
it is key to remember that

330
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,639
you need only lose control data from one

331
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:55,120
person

332
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,160
to lose your compliance

333
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,120
now the first loophole that people seem

334
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,920
to be

335
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,079
unaware of when trying to enforce this

336
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,000
law as citizens

337
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,320
it's that national laws can and do

338
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,360
supersede

339
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,760
data protection regulations for example

340
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,160
in the case of hr after an employee

341
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,440
leaves a company

342
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,440
they can request to have their employee

343
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,120
data deleted

344
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,480
hr is held to comply but payroll

345
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,360
contracts and often evaluation forms

346
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,639
need to be kept for

347
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,920
set periods of time so how did hr

348
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,959
actually comply well

349
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,120
hr had to remove any sensitive data such

350
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,560
as biometrics

351
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,800
from their management platform usually

352
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,600
covered by

353
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,639
national employee protection laws

354
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,279
they had to remove the employee profile

355
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,920
as a potential future candidate

356
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,920
and verify that any recruitment

357
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,440
platforms they use

358
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,680
are no longer linked to this employee

359
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,160
through them

360
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,240
now if we go back to the example where

361
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,279
you

362
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,720
travel is safe again went go to the

363
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,440
hotel you had your meal

364
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,000
had your beers now you're leaving you

365
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,920
have to pay

366
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,920
when you pay you're generating a

367
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,279
transaction record which is linked to

368
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,000
your reservation

369
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,519
which in turn is linked back to you

370
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,680
through name phone number

371
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,240
email address same when you go to a

372
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:22,880
restaurant

373
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,439
especially with modern booking platforms

374
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,760
these transaction records can't be

375
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,880
modified

376
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,920
because money laundering

377
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,199
the risk is of course that as we move

378
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,680
towards paperless solutions

379
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,000
both companies will provide analytics on

380
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,720
both

381
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,880
these financial records or the hr

382
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,760
records

383
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,199
now arguably hr could attempt

384
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,920
anonymization

385
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,600
but this will only work if you're able

386
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,480
to anonymize the entire

387
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,959
company how many people have worked in

388
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,959
companies where it was composed of

389
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,519
two three maybe five people out of one

390
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,199
hundred

391
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,199
very difficult to not notice the

392
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,760
outliers

393
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,839
in the case of the financial records

394
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,279
once again

395
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,360
losing the data from your clients

396
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,519
off-premise with other consent

397
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,079
is losing compliance even if it's not

398
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,279
done for marketing purposes

399
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,480
bonus for the uk following the first

400
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,760
lockdown

401
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,720
bars and pubs opened visitors had to

402
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,399
check into the locations for contact

403
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,160
tracing

404
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,120
the nhs enforced an application which

405
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,560
allowed people to check into these

406
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,279
locations

407
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,519
scanning qr codes making it easy

408
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,000
since then it's been noticed that data

409
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,800
from this

410
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,880
government-backed program was being

411
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,000
harvested and sold on to advertisers

412
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,959
the last news i have is that the ico is

413
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:55,839
planning on

414
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,759
suing the government because of this

415
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,920
second loophole is in regards with how

416
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,360
your third-party vendors

417
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,079
provide analytics so you have your

418
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:08,880
business

419
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,399
with your erp and your nice database

420
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,480
now the problem is your erp provides

421
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,040
windows 2.0 analytics

422
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,160
graphics sorry so you need a separate

423
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,120
business to

424
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,639
give you some usable analytics

425
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,120
except of course this business doesn't

426
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,920
provide

427
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,839
an on-premise solution now i looked for

428
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,120
the largest providers of analytics

429
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,000
salesforce salesforce don't offer

430
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,079
on-premise solutions

431
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,560
they do have solutions that connect

432
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,199
directly to your erp

433
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,519
which would be compliant as you are

434
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,800
never storing data

435
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,399
on their servers however

436
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,000
maybe your business can't quite afford

437
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,759
salesforce so you get a smaller provider

438
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,920
the smaller provider can't quite afford

439
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,839
to pay oracle

440
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:06,240
sap or other tech giants for their apis

441
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,520
which means they need to rebuild your

442
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,240
database off-premise

443
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,079
i have seen vendors who try to do this

444
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,520
through unencrypted email

445
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,280
which big no-no and critically

446
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,599
with no controls as to which data is

447
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,799
being shared over to them

448
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,599
the issue here is of course that well

449
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,640
you as a business are

450
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,200
seen as the data controller whereas your

451
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,400
vendor

452
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,720
is only the data processor this means

453
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,600
you have different levels of

454
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,400
responsibility

455
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,960
well while your vendor's application may

456
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,559
be gdpr compliant

457
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,919
they can delete information from their

458
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,559
databases and all that the way they get

459
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:46,960
the

460
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,760
information is not necessarily compliant

461
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,160
nor

462
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,440
are the controls they can try to

463
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,840
implement

464
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,640
if the vendor is breached and they have

465
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,080
information about people which they

466
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,600
should not have

467
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,679
as data controller your businesses find

468
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,000
a heavier penalty

469
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,400
in the reverse if the business is

470
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,360
breached

471
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,000
and these lack of controls are found the

472
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,840
vendor can claim to be compliant

473
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,240
given that data flow controls are not in

474
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,799
their hands

475
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
horror story number two so like most

476
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,039
people i get my

477
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,039
fair share of phishing and spam emails

478
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,799
recently i've noticed more and more

479
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,240
people are

480
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,080
spoofing domains from companies that i

481
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,760
may have had contact with in the past

482
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,280
usually abusing some subdomain or

483
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,280
otherwise

484
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,320
being a the nice jolly fellow i am i let

485
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,440
the company know that

486
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,480
something's going on 99

487
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,520
of the time i don't hear back

488
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,360
except when the guy reading the email is

489
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,440
from sales

490
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,520
this happened once only once and i'm

491
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,160
very glad it only happened once

492
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,960
this guy from sales told me to off

493
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,480
their domain insecure

494
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,799
nothing's going on i defunked the links

495
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,760
showed him his email was well showed him

496
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,080
the

497
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,520
mail was pointing somewhere else told

498
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,039
him just please check in with it

499
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,160
he said no the mail was from me and two

500
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,120
weeks later

501
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,120
they of course were in the news for

502
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,080
compromised infrastructure

503
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,320
please let your sales guys know

504
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,200
disclosure

505
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,679
is always good and should be forwarded

506
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,080
to you

507
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,280
now with all this in mind

508
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,320
how can we as it people best help

509
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,600
enforce compliance well if you work in

510
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,799
it

511
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,799
in the services industry triple check

512
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,400
how your data flow out of your

513
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,559
infrastructure is controlled

514
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,880
what controls you have in place are they

515
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,840
human are they automatic

516
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,640
check the contracts with your vendors

517
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,000
how do they assume responsibility if

518
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,720
they get breached

519
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,799
how can they demonstrate that has been

520
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,080
deleted from their

521
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,240
infrastructure and critically

522
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,000
what is their incident response plan if

523
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,840
they get breached on how does your

524
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,520
business fit into that incident response

525
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,240
plan

526
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,640
you need that information for developing

527
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,080
your own incident response plan

528
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,280
as clients of the services industry it's

529
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,559
important to be clear when making

530
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,000
reservations that

531
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,400
your data is only to be used for

532
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,640
information regarding the reservations

533
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,400
and billing in order to add preventive

534
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,039
measures

535
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,559
use a casual email or even

536
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,679
plus a license from gmail this way

537
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,760
if there is an issue you can quickly

538
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,080
alert the business

539
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,320
should you get a satisfaction survey or

540
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,320
marketing of any sort

541
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,720
ask to contact the it department they

542
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,039
will be able to correct any issues

543
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,520
and provide evidence of account deletion

544
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,159
even from third party vendors

545
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,679
potentially they can even get you a

546
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,000
discount for future visits

547
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,679
for helping them correct the compliance

548
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,000
issue

549
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,360
finally should you be involved in

550
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,559
a risk assessment red team exercise or

551
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,280
just a penetration test offer your i.t

552
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,520
point of contact to review the data flow

553
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,200
out of their erp the red flags will pop

554
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,240
up

555
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,640
as well as verifying procedures for

556
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,960
records not affected by gdpr

557
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,200
us asia africa oceania

558
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,400
are the controls automatic or human

559
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,159
what protections are there in place in

560
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,000
the case of mistakes

561
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,679
by helping companies implement better

562
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,840
controls we are also providing the

563
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,480
population with better privacy

564
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,240
companies may forget that compliance is

565
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,840
not something that is obtained once

566
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,240
and kept forever but rather something

567
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,320
which needs to be verified every day

568
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,480
and can be lost once forever

569
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,520
now finally one success story

570
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,240
that's me again circa this time last

571
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:06,559
year

572
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,240
going to japan for the rugby world cup

573
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,000
where i had of course had to go through

574
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,440
their system to buy tickets

575
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,039
they have now started advertising for

576
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:21,200
the 2023 world cup in france

577
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,320
so i received the marketing

578
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,880
and i tried to check if my account still

579
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,320
worked

580
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,400
i noticed it didn't contacted the dpo

581
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,000
who kind of said yeah gdpr

582
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,679
we don't need the data beyond the fact

583
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,280
that the tickets were sold

584
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,760
the world cup was over we are now

585
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,960
rebuilding everything

586
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,480
just kept the email for the crm

587
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,760
good case of well

588
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,080
limited time data um retention

589
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,120
goes to show even world businesses can

590
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,520
do it

591
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,600
i hope everyone was able to get some

592
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,000
insight into the workings of gdpr

593
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,400
and how best to use this legislation for

594
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,720
the protection of your own privacy

595
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,080
bit early for the beer for me but i know

596
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:12,480
some

597
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,320
viewers are further ahead in the time

598
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,639
zones

599
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,400
now if you're not sure

600
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,520
if your company is compliant do not go

601
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,799
looking for a company that sells

602
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,200
compliance

603
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,400
first thing to do close the tap stop any

604
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,720
data leaks on your site

605
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,960
second step get a lawyer and get a

606
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,000
lawyer in the room not

607
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,240
in the emails you want someone to be

608
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,480
there who can properly get

609
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,320
an expert on sites provide privileged

610
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,159
communication

611
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,200
and really help you with the disclosure

612
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,480
if you do need to disclose to your

613
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,080
local gdpr enforcers

614
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,840
i would like to thank the beer farmers

615
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,240
for organizing this

616
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,840
i would like to thank the mentors for

617
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,240
providing

618
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,840
so much time for helping with the public

619
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,919
speaking

620
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,640
and i know that the beer farmers are

621
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,919
british based so

622
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,000
you might be wondering well why should

623
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,320
people in the uk care

624
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,799
well as people in the uk it's very

625
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,480
likely you will be visiting

626
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,799
europe maybe a couple years

627
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,279
in this case gdpr of course applies to

628
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,279
you

629
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,480
if you are however a business in the uk

630
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,360
well you have the data protection act

631
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,400
which is enforced by the ico

632
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,600
the ico also enforces gdpr in the uk

633
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,840
which means a business can be penalized

634
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:49,279
twice for the same mishap

635
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:55,200
thank you i hope that was interesting

636
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,760
great thanks ron uh juan fantastic talk

637
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,159
um

638
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,279
all about gdpr um so i think we've got

639
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,279
five minutes left so i'd like to open up

640
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,559
with a question

641
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,600
um especially in the uk you can't

642
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,720
mention gdpr

643
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,679
without mentioning british airways um

644
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,200
what are your thoughts on

645
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,799
the recent farm because i know in

646
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,640
uh intended to find them

647
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,440
yep so go ahead british airways is a

648
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,360
special case

649
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,039
because they are providing a service of

650
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,960
course with the

651
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,400
air flights however they do have a lot

652
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,159
of the technical elements behind them

653
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,399
i think it's a special case

654
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,320
gdpr if we take it if we make an analogy

655
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,760
with a bank

656
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,279
if a bank gets robbed they don't get

657
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:54,400
fined for getting robbed

658
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,840
so

659
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,080
ba has been under a lot of heat the past

660
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,679
couple years

661
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,400
it was a key case study when i was still

662
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,480
doing my degree

663
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,200
in it because of their data outage in

664
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,000
2017

665
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,039
is it fair is it not fair i mean they've

666
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,720
had enough time to

667
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,799
rebuild and reshape and

668
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:28,159
definitely agree that the ico is right

669
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,039
in

670
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,480
fining them i am surprised that the fine

671
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,679
keeps getting lower and lower though

672
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,480
yeah i mean we've got two questions so

673
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,240
i'm just gonna make this very quick um

674
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,240
my concern and i'd love to get your

675
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,520
thoughts um

676
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,799
is having these fines reduce reduced

677
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,480
what's incentive for the companies to

678
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,320
then start doing the right thing

679
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,279
um it could be more cost effective in

680
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:53,679
fact

681
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,320
to not do the right thing and simply pay

682
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,720
the phone

683
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,240
so that's the thing right because you

684
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,440
because you don't have

685
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,720
a a baseline requirement so you need to

686
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,640
invest say five percent of your profits

687
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,400
in security

688
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,720
you don't have you don't have any

689
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,559
incentives on that sense

690
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,720
it's very difficult and the only real

691
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,000
loss is

692
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,039
of course the fine and then the trust

693
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,000
the public has in you

694
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,279
i think hopefully with the new

695
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,720
regulations that are coming up you have

696
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,919
the california privacy act

697
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:32,960
i'm hoping we're going to be getting

698
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,440
some more in the americas

699
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,120
and asia propping up soon

700
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,760
which will then lead to more of this

701
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,440
especially with multinationals like ba

702
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,880
who are not just dealing with british

703
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,840
customers but really

704
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,840
worldwide yeah

705
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,679
i totally agree so fingers crossed um

706
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,120
don't certainly hope that's going to be

707
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,279
the case so we have two

708
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:00,000
questions from the audience um i don't

709
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,360
have them to hand scott

710
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,120
could you ask them please yeah sure

711
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,480
um so the first one's from hale nolly uh

712
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,279
who asks what are the biggest challenges

713
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:11,679
you

714
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,440
face balancing security with compliance

715
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,679
uh and he added in the caveat of

716
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,520
obviously compliance does not always

717
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,639
equal security

718
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,840
so if you have security you should have

719
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,000
compliance

720
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,080
because if you secure your information

721
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,440
nothing's leaving

722
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,880
you have one point of failure not two

723
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,919
the biggest challenge i faced with

724
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,880
compliance would have been with regards

725
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,399
to

726
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,120
vendors as i mentioned i worked in

727
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,799
hospitality

728
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,480
so we had information coming in from

729
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,799
other places

730
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,120
it's uh very difficult to be able to

731
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,399
explain to people that

732
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,600
we can delete information about them or

733
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,919
anonymize it but if they're reserved

734
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,000
through booking.com for example

735
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,760
we have no control over that information

736
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,000
there

737
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,159
and i would say that that was the

738
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,520
biggest challenge

739
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,240
okay thanks for that um we also have a

740
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,679
question from

741
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,640
b who's asked can we say human controls

742
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,919
in some cases have

743
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:27,840
always failed

744
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,360
human control i mean it's obviously a

745
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,960
big point of failure

746
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,640
we always say the weakest link is of

747
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,399
course the end user

748
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,880
however if you're for example scanning

749
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,760
passports

750
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,960
because you need to provide a list to

751
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,559
the police on a daily basis

752
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,600
are you automating this to then scan

753
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,120
where this is coming from and then

754
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,320
you're adding another point of failure

755
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,760
where is that information being routed

756
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,000
through

757
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,520
i think being able to know

758
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,960
the human element there i would say is

759
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,480
really not just the people doing the

760
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,880
operations but really

761
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,880
understanding where your information is

762
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,880
going and how it's being routed

763
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,840
for the people who are working with it

764
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,320
okay

765
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,559
um listen i just want to relay um a

766
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:17,760
couple of comments from

767
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,039
from the general slack and personally um

768
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,559
this is kind of like the coolest talk

769
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,880
i've been to about gdpr gdpr sounds

770
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,480
really super boring and you always see

771
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,240
it crop up and you're like now i'll just

772
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,679
leave it this has been really super

773
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:30,880
informative

774

just

777
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,320
it does my head and and it's not clear

778
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,120
and it's just

779
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,200
it's not it's kind of like a knee-jerk

780
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,480
reaction it's not quite

781
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,480

pointed out

801
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,600
gdpr and compliance generally can be a

802
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,519
bit dry it's one of the big things i

803
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,279
