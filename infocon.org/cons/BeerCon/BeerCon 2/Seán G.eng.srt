bands

67
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,879

68
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,879
three years ago we recall that no

three four years ago we were called the

70
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,920
suppressors and i played the bass uh

71
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,120
because guitar is hard

72
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,120
and uh i had impossible guitar

73
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,480
i have too many instruments i have an

74
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,000
electric guitar i have two acoustic

75
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,599
guitars i have a mandolin

76
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,440
i have a problem um i should really stop

77
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,640
wasting my money instruments

78
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,480
actually i also have a little bird thing

79
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,160
that if you dip it in water right

80
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,760
you you blow into it and it sounds like

81
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,120
an actual tweet bird it's the coolest

82
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,680
thing

83
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,440
they won't let me put on any albums if i

84
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,519
ever got the chance though so

85
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,319
um i was originally a bartender as you

86
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,519
can tell by the fact that i'm an

87
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,400
alcoholic

88
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,120
uh i used to i've worked all over the

89
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,319
place um

90
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,920
i don't have any vietnam flashbacks or

91
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,840
anything especially when dan khan

92
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,440
brought up nightclubs

93
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,000
not at all

94
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,599
and i love an l point and i love to have

95
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,159
the crack

96
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,879
so also 10 points for the person who

97
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,239
knows what the uh the actual gift there

98
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,360
was a reference to

99
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,440
so just a quick agenda so you know what

100
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,959
the actual crack is going on

101
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,640
uh i'm gonna give just a little i'm

102
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,680
gonna start off by giving a quick

103
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,680
history of kind of like dos and ddos and

104
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,879
all that sort of crack

105
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,080
and then i'm going to give you an idea

106
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,360
what the difference between all the dust

107
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,080
is is this is

108
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,200
this is and then

109
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,480
i'm going to give you a brief reason why

110
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,760
i'm actually sort of doing this thing

111
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,280
and not just make it feel like i'm just

112
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,120
talking absolute shot for about 30

113
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,000
minutes or so

114
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,440
i'll because i can just do that on my

115
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,200
own i don't really need the excuse

116
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,040
um i'm going to go through a few

117
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,840
different types of justices

118
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,599
and i'm going to give an idea of some

119
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,360
sexy tools that you can use but don't

120
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,040
actually use because that's illegal

121
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,959
uh some mitigation techniques a few

122
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,480
examples and then if we have the time

123
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,920
we'll have a minute silence for the fact

124
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,840
that the dublin bars were this close two

125
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,680
days away from opening again

126
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,720
so yeah anyway

127
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,799
let's get started uh this is just sort

128
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,640
of a brief abridged history and there's

129
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,680
probably someone looking at this it's

130
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,400
just like

131
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,959
that's not the first one because from

132
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,560
all the research i was doing

133
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,639
everybody seems to have a more like

134
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,918
newer sort of dos

135
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,960
or ddos going around uh i'm i'm

136
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,320
i won't be surprised if somebody's about

137
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,680
to email me in about 10 minutes it's

138
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,160
like no

139
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,639
the first dos happened at the time of

140
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,440
thermopylae

141
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,960
when they came not automatically in the

142
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,400
battle of marathon when they came around

143
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,880
and got all the persians

144
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,560
that's not a dos that's a battle that's

145
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,240
history get get used to it

146
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,360
so anyway the first uh dos or the first

147
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,479
dos was uh

148
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,000
supposedly originally in 1974 by a 13

149
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,880
year old called

150
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,360
david dennis so basically david dennis

151
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:51,919
was uh

152
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,520
is a school was a student in a

153
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,360
it was just a high school university it

154
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,880
was a weird name i think he was using it

155
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,680
to probably cover

156
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,560
his own opsec uh so basically he was he

157
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,080
he had a bit of interest in computers at

158
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,880
the time

159
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,160
and he he went over to the uh have my

160
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,280
notes here sorry

161
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,000
uh the computer education research or

162
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,560
searle

163
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,160
or computer education research and

164
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,320
squiggly line laboratory i'm very good

165
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,160
at writing um

166
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,759
one over there found out that machines

167
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,520
over there had this command called ext

168
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,800
which basically was

169
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
and don't correct that you can correct

170
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,919
me if you want i'm probably getting

171
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:28,960
shout out this is going to be the wrong

172
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,039
command but it's ext basically was

173
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,800
a shutdown command back in the day or to

174
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,240
process a shutdown command

175
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,240
but there wasn't in proper um

176
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,560
sort of authorization uh set on the

177
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,720
computer so basically he went in with

178
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,720
i'm assuming a floppy disk went on to

179
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,479
one of the computers basically typed in

180
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,600
this command sent it or

181
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,440
wrote a script put it onto one of the

182
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,919
computers and just watched is about half

183
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,680
of all the computers shut down midway

184
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,560
through use

185
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,199
uh another example of a dos attack would

186
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:57,759
be

187
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,039
um well there's one of the first

188
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,400
dots i keep saying first because of

189
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,919
obviously the reason that i said before

190
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,199
where it's a bit like

191
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,800
is it the first or is it a second who

192
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,319
actually knows uh

193
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,360
so there was a dos attack in between

194
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,960
september 6th and september 10

195
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,440
1996 in new york basically a company

196
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,199
called panics which is with an isp at

197
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:17,759
the time

198
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,919
was hit by a symbolod sin flood not

199
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,280
simple that's a gang

200
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,560
um sinflo dos attack where uh

201
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,800
basically they shut down the company for

202
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,080
i believe

203
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,199
note look 36 hours and they were

204
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,639
using that time when they actually shut

205
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,720
it down they were domain hijacking and

206
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,160
they were trying to get access to the

207
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,880
mail

208
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,800
the news the website and all that sort

209
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,960
of stuff uh basically just overwhelm the

210
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,319
computer and just

211
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,639
took her out you know yourself uh the

212
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,479
first ddos actual presentation was

213
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:47,840
actually done in defcon so if there's

214
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,639
anybody

215
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,880
from defcon never been i live in europe

216
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,080
so you know yourself

217
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,840
uh it was done by a guy called can see

218
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,160
smith during defcon in 1997.

219
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,240
he basically disrupted the entirety of

220
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,520
the internet along the strip

221
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,000
of las vegas uh from that the sample

222
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,280
code was released from that actual

223
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,199
presentation which led to

224
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,720
uh several attacks happening with sprint

225
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,319
erdogan and e-trade

226
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,080
and then last but not least on the

227
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,440
history of somebody's going to message

228
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,880
me and tell me i'm completely wrong and

229
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,160
i'm fine with that because i'm wrong

230
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,520
90 of the time 100 at the time um

231
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,599
was the first large-scale ddos attack

232
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,680
which happened in august 1999 where

233
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,360
basically disabled the university of

234
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,039
minnesota which i originally wrote as

235
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,800
mini sodas because i was thirsty at the

236
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,599
time

237
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,240
um i can't believe i keep looking at my

238
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,080
notes i swear i was learning this

239
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,759
uh basically shut it down with a udp

240
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:36,240
flood

241
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,120
but uh use it with the tool of trino

242
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,280
which was basically it would um

243
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,520
fragment it or that it would obscure the

244
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,800
packets and make it look like it was

245
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,080
actually it didn't keep with the same

246
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,440
exact attack it would make the the

247
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,800
traffic look a little bit different so

248
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,840
it would look a little bit more

249
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,720
realistic

250
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,479
anyway we'll move on and i'll accept all

251
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:53,840
your emails up tell me i'm wrong i'm

252
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,800
fine with it

253
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,800
so i just want to give you a basic idea

254
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,000
what a ddos and a dos

255
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,360
is because when i was originally

256
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,199
starting and i realized i put dos for

257
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,879
distributed denial of service as well

258
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,240
but you know yourself i was up for 30

259
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:04,960
hours

260
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,080
um i wrote that one before so you know

261
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,360
um so basically the difference between a

262
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,800
denial of service and a distributed

263
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,800
denial of service is basically

264
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,639
a denial of service is an attack that

265
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,240
comes from a single source

266
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,160
it is also used for flooding targets

267
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,440
until they basically collapse

268
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,199
or can they can use the time to actually

269
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,960
gain access to that machine by basically

270
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,440
like

271
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,319
creating this sort of traffic to hide

272
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,599
everything else that's happening

273
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,680
it's as i was saying and make it crash

274
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,958
or unavailable and

275
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,719
it ranges from people using it for

276
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,360
simple fun for financial game or an

277
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,360
ideology such as hacktivism or

278
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,479
cybercrime or cyber warfare

279
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,640
the whole shebang everything you think

280
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,080
it is it probably is

281
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,600
and then with distributed denial of

282
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,600
service attacks it's an attack that

283
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,440
comes from multiple sources but the

284
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,080
use of botnets and it's the exact same

285
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,360
thing just with a lot more machines

286
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,839
uh so to give an example what a dawson

287
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,680
adidas is i've decided to use a lovely

288
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,720
picture of scott that i

289
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,760
found of his brothers um so this

290
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,160
is the idea of a dos attack where um

291
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,920
scooty mc scoot with the hat

292
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,320
uh is attacking an innocent little child

293
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,279
and we will be calling the police

294
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,399
someone eventually

295
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,360
and then the idea of a ddos attack is

296
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,200
poor little scoot star

297
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,880
about to never see the light of day

298
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,360
again you rest in pieces

299
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,040
start fish pieces so to give a basic a

300
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,959
bit of an idea why i'm here

301
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,279
um i kind of want to talk about how ddos

302
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,600
was on the rise

303
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,120
especially with this year with the whole

304
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,560
cover pandemic there's been a lot more

305
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,160
people inside so as a result there's

306
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,200
been a lot of ways of

307
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,040
um a lot of increase of people on the

308
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,240
net and as a result there's been a lot

309
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,040
more attacks

310
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,640
to give sort of an idea i was on the

311
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,080
caspari website on

312
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,080
uh when i read through the casper

313
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,360
website i was

314
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,080
on many other websites i was found that

315
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,440
um the ddos had

316
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,640
doubled by about nearly 80

317
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,320
80 more than what it originally was

318
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,079
where if you see on the graph here

319
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,399
where on the fourth quarter of 2000 or

320
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,480
the first quarter 2019 it's representing

321
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,760
what it would have originally been back

322
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,320
then

323
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,680
then by the fourth quarter by the end of

324
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,880
the year it obviously went very much

325
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,160
down because usually at the start of the

326
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,160
year there's a lot more dos attacks

327
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,320
uh but by the first quarter of this year

328
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,680
because everybody was kind it was

329
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,880
basically going inside

330
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,440
dos attacks jumped by a significant

331
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,320
amount

332
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,800
uh along with this there has also been

333
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,240
an increase of the the

334
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,760
attacks have become a lot longer as a

335
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,079
result uh they've increased by the

336
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,040
longevity of about 24 as you can also

337
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,640
see with the uh graphs there how they've

338
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,680
just

339
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,040
whooped way up and lastly

340
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,560
uh when it comes to all these sort of

341
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,160
dos attacks there's a majority amount of

342
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,240
just sin float attacks in general uh in

343
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,839
comparison to other attacks

344
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,959
so that's just for you people out there

345
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,640
being like oh i wonder what's the most

346
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,079
you know if it's ever in a pub quiz

347
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,920
you'll know i'll forget

348
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,360
because i forget things

349
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,200
anyway it's going to give you there's

350
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,240
like several different ways of

351
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,680
describing a dos attack

352
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,839
or denial of service or a distributed

353
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:06,959
denial of service

354
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,040
but it can be kind of just sort of put

355
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,800
into three different ways so

356
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,240
the first one would be a volume based

357
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,519
attack which basically would use a

358
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,560
botnet to generate

359
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,079
massive amounts of traffic to basically

360
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,160
just plug the thing basically just

361
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,760
battery in that server until she goes

362
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,480
down

363
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,399
uh they would send so many requests to

364
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,760
the server constantly just hitting it

365
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,440
with information that it would just like

366
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,279
collapse examples of this being like a

367
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,040
udp flood or an icmp flood a http flawed

368
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,760
a smurf attack or a dns amplification

369
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,040
all that sort of stuff

370
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,079
uh next we have a protocol attack which

371
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,920
basically the goal of that is basically

372
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,440
kind of like the volume based one is

373
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,760
it's pro it's job is to overload the

374
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,279
server but it would target you

375
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,120
the network layers of the system

376
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,320
examples this would be

377
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,440
uh ping of debt a smurf dos or ddos a

378
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,160
syn flood

379
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,560
all that sort of stuff last but not

380
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,000
least we have the application layer

381
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,519
which basically submits traffic to

382
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,120
particular port protocols

383
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,000
and we use a botnet to um basically hone

384
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,240
in

385
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,000
toward or use a botnet to send as much

386
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,519
traffic as possible towards it

387
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,600
examples of this would be get post

388
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,760
floods or my absolute favorite thing of

389
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,760
all time low and slow attacks but my

390
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,959
absolute favorite attack that you'll

391
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,240
find out in a few minutes

392
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,920
i'm not biased this might have actually

393
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,680
been the reason i wrote this entire talk

394
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,120
because i wanted to originally do for a

395
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,200
college assignment and they said no

396
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,839
so i'm like i'll show you

397
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,079
uh so before we actually start i forgot

398
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,079
about that gif uh i just kind of want to

399
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,839
give like a bit more detailed overview

400
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:32,480
so

401
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,160
floating attacks is your basic your

402
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,240
standard sort of like attack when uh dos

403
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,680
attack when you hear if it does one

404
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,839
moment

405
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,000
this stuff has been keeping me alive for

406
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
30 hours i should stop

407
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,760
um when it comes to dos the kind of

408
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,040
when the first thing you think of oh

409
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,480
yeah a dos attack you'd be just sending

410
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,760
massive amount of information that's

411
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,959
sort of the flawed attack that would be

412
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,120
sort of the main idea you get

413
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,320
uh basically as i was saying the it's

414
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,079
flooding the service with amount data as

415
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,920
you can and basically the same just to

416
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,880
exhaust the system

417
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,240
examples would be like i was saying the

418
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,000
http flood your icmp

419
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,440
ping flood udp flood sin flood et cetera

420
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,120
uh all the different types just sort of

421
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,880
go a bit more extended you would have uh

422
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,480
your synth flood which basically takes

423
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,600
advantage of the three

424
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,160
the tcp three-way handshake or basically

425
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,079
if anybody knows networking where

426
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,519
you basically you send like uh like hey

427
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:26,800
i want to connect to you and it

428
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,000
acknowledges you and then you

429
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,160
acknowledge that it's

430
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,000
accepted you where instead of that you

431
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,519
just go like hey i want to connect

432
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,040
hey i want to connect hey i want to

433
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,240
connect hey i want to connect hey i want

434
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,360
to connect hey i want to connect

435
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,959
and the whole thing just gets terrified

436
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,560
and then cries in the corner and

437
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,399
uh probably gets an alcohol addiction as

438
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,320
a result don't abuse your servers they

439
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,519
have alcohol problems

440
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,560
um the next one will be http flood which

441
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,839
basically is the same

442
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,399
idea where um when you're accessing a

443
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,920
server you're trying to get information

444
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,279
you would get a get command or if you're

445
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,480
trying to post information you'd be

446
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,399
putting a or like say if you're posting

447
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,199
a

448
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,720
on a form you'd send it would send a

449
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,160
post command who basically just keeps

450
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,839
sending that information over and over

451
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,040
and over and over

452
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,639
until they get scared again and also

453
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,959
joins the uh the syn flood in the bar

454
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,040
crying and thinking of the good old

455
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,000
times when everybody left them alone

456
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,519
um udp float is even worse it's um

457
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,440
in my opinion it's worse because it's

458
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,040
okay when somebody's like it's okay it's

459
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,160
okay but if they're just they're

460
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,279
flooding you from everywhere

461
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,120
they're flooding in random ports they're

462
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,639
just causing the host to constantly

463
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,240
check what the hell is going on probably

464
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:28,880
just

465
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,320
given some mental health problems to

466
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,360
that server over there um

467
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,519
it would basically when it's doesn't

468
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,360
know what's going on a replica and

469
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,920
an icmp which is ping a destination and

470
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,639
reach packet

471
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,320
and it would just sap as many resources

472
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,519
and probably give it severe mental

473
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,880
health issues

474
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,680
one can relate uh an icmp flood it would

475
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,199
overwhelm the tackle whatever the ping

476
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,320
echoes as possible

477
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,240
it would generate traffic as fast as

478
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,680
possible considering pings are a lot

479
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,959
easier to generate

480
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,120
uh generate them without writing or

481
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,800
waiting for replies i didn't write

482
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,760
writing books

483
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,760
uh and it would consume both the outcome

484
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,880
and incoming bandwidth

485
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,639
on not a fun time don't hang out with

486
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,240
these people they'll ruin your life

487
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,720
um just to give you an idea an

488
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,480
application attack which is i think is

489
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,760
the coolest thing ever because it makes

490
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,519
me always think of rock and roll music

491
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,920
uh an application attack it would send a

492
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,360
smaller bit of packets

493
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,399
to say you're the attacker and

494
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,880
you want to take down um

495
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,600
micklebray.com please don't take down

496
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,160
mybray.com it doesn't exist but you know

497
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,199
um you want to take that down

498
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,199
you would send you would find something

499
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,800
vulnerable on the net and you would send

500
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,639
a little thing a little tiny or little

501
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,240
tiny bits of information to that but

502
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,920
you'd spoof the ip of the actual

503
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,720
location

504
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,480
of the the the target that you want so

505
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,920
you send a little bit of an occasion and

506
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,279
then the actual thing that gets sent is

507
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:45,839
like

508
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,320
like a giant waking up being like oh

509
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,360
what's going on

510
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,000
send even heavier traffic and if you

511
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,360
were to do this for like even

512
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,000
uh like bigger amount of ping or bigger

513
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,199
amounts of uh data

514
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,880
as a result so you'd be sending if you

515
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,480
have a botnet you could send little bits

516
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,920
of data to these machines and then they

517
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,360
would send massive amount of data to the

518
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,079
target basically

519
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,160
as it says on the tim amplifying the

520
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,000
actual attack as it is

521
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,920
apologies and a result that would

522
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,839
overload the target and the examples of

523
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,120
this would be your like dns

524
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,160
amplification

525
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,880
your smurf attack your fragile fraggle

526
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,440
attack

527
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,560
etc i know english is probably my first

528
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,279
language

529
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,759
um an application attack uh just to sort

530
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,120
of give you a few ideas of the types

531
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,880
there's dns amplification

532
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,600
which is uh i might as well just say

533
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,199
straight off they all spoof the ip so

534
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,480
you know that's the easy part of

535
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,199
remembering

536
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,959
so they'd spoof the ip of the victim and

537
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,360
request access to the website via dns

538
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,560
so your bigthebraid.com or

539
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,120
whatever computer is getting overwhelmed

540
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,880
by like all these dns requests

541
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,240
and pos would cause the victim to crash

542
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,759
a smurf attack is the same thing but

543
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,079
with like icmps so it would lead to the

544
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:54,880
uh

545
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,279
the ping flood of the victim's computer

546
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,920
fraggles attack same idea spoofing ip

547
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,120
with udp traffic instead of icmp

548
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,160
um constantly just overwhelmed icmp or

549
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,599
it would overwhelm the

550
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,480
reuters broadcast address with uh

551
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,760
without udp

552
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,160
uh the thing about smurf attacks and

553
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,280
fragile attacks though they're not

554
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,559
exactly as

555
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,240
prevalent or work as much anymore

556
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,839
fragile attacks are basically in most

557
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,799
routers

558
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,280
are completely harmless i really don't

559
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,480
regret saying that

560
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,319
uh and with smurf attacks

561
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,480
there's probably one in a bazillion

562
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,280
so don't try that out that's illegal uh

563
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,640
mtp

564
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,640
uh amplification i swear i don't have an

565
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,000
amplifier right here and i should just

566
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,320
you know

567
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,760
know how to say amplifier um mtp

568
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,400
amplification basically ntp is

569
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,559
is a way of checking all that all the

570
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,320
things in the network are

571
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,080
synchronized on the same time basically

572
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,600
sending that to send massive amount of

573
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,760
time data and scaring your computer

574
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,880
and making it crash so

575
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,640
continuing on to that my actual favorite

576
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,559
subject would be the

577
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,720
low and slow attack or as i like to call

578
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,200
it slow ride take it easy

579
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,640
i'm not for singing the rest of it you

580
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,480
ain't paying me enough here uh

581
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,919
basically it's the aims of taking down

582
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,600
the service quietly uh

583
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,960
it aims to keep the connect all

584
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,880
connections open by

585
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,280
sending a little bit of data at a time

586
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,480
so it send like

587
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,919
a bit or two to a port and it would open

588
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:24,960
the connections like oh

589
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,240
we have a connection and it's waiting

590
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,440
for the rest of the communication so

591
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,240
it's waiting

592
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,919
but there's a timeout sequence and just

593
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,280
before it's about to time out

594
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,520
it sends another bit of data so it's

595
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,720
like

596
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,480
imagine you're at home you're going to

597
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,600
bed and you're just about to fall asleep

598
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,360
and now here is it like what

599
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,799
you're like oh it's fine but you're

600
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,559
constantly just hearing this beep over

601
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,760
and over and over but

602
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,880
you've really just it annoys you so much

603
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,240
that you eventually get angry and pissed

604
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,440
get really pissed off

605
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,520
and even though there's really soup but

606
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,559
it's the idea of just getting really

607
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:57,600
pissed off in the server just like you

608
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,960
know what screw it i'm going out i'm

609
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,320
going to the pub and i'm going to get

610
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,000
really hammered and find whenever they

611
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,960
ditch somewhere

612
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,240
so really i'm really like pushing my own

613
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,280
problems onto these servers

614
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,520
anyway because of this how this attack

615
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,679
all these attacks are the uh

616
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:14,960
because it's only sending out a little

617
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,720
bit of data at a time you only need a

618
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,080
smaller better bandwidth to actually

619
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,200
perform these attacks

620
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,120
as a result you could perform these

621
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,880
attacks and probably just go about and

622
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,000
just do whatever you want on your

623
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,799
computer

624
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,919
not that you should ever do these

625
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,360
attacks unless it's within a controlled

626
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,559
environment and you're just testing

627
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:29,280
something

628
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,240
um these can go as well undetected

629
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,080
originally for a very very very long

630
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,520
time considering it wouldn't your

631
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,000
uh your ddos uh or slash ddos like

632
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,840
mitigation tools wouldn't like catch

633
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,520
this massive amount of traffic coming in

634
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,720
it wouldn't get fined but it's like oh

635
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,559
there's a little bit of better traffic

636
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,039
these are examples of these would be

637
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,559
your slow lars which

638
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:51,919
is my favorite attack of all time

639
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,360
there's the answer keep that one for the

640
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,799
pub quiz at the end because it's not an

641
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:55,520
answer there

642
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,320
there's also rudy uh and there's stock

643
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:58,880
stress

644
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,000
or sock stress which is something i

645
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,039
relate to

646
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:06,320
right i forgot my little thing i had a

647
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,840
little snail going along but i was too

648
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,720
into my own voice

649
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,720
actually let the little snail go by so

650
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,039
bye snail you'll get there one day

651
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,240
don't worry once i'm done this thing

652
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,600
i'll just watch this nail go by and

653
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,880
nobody else will see it but i'll know

654
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,919
he's there

655
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,080
uh so as i was saying slow loris the

656
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,200
most adorable dot

657
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,440
the dos adorable dos name i'm possibly

658
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,880
the most adorable tech name in the

659
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,600
distance

660
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,080
don't at me in fact do send me the most

661
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:28,960
adorable dot

662
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,280
like adorable tech names you can at

663
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,039
mickeybray.com do it right now on

664
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:33,679
twitter but

665
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,880
actually after this conference um it was

666
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,919
originally created by

667
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,760
robert or snake hansen sorry for the

668
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,960
dockster mate but it's all over the

669
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,159
internet so

670
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,240
uh basically as i was kind of describing

671
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,360
it would event sound

672
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,440
very slow http requests but like a

673
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,880
single byte being all like

674
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,559
so basically like a letter a letter

675
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,000
every single time and it's just like

676
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,640
this is

677
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,080
the server's like this is great i hate

678
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,760
this and i was saying it doesn't require

679
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,640
a lot of bandwidth

680
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,280
and apache servers one and two were

681
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,799
completely vulnerable to this

682
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,400
notable use of this would have been in

683
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,000
the dosing of the irani government

684
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,919
website in 2009

685
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,159
in protests to the iranian presidential

686
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,760
election which i'm not going to get into

687
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,320
um my other favorite one even though

688
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,679
it's named after funny enough a

689
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:16,000
different

690
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,120
song i've decided it's named after um

691
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,960
a message to you rudy because it's every

692
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,720
time i hear like oh yeah and are you

693
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,799
dead yet

694
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:27,679
because that's a great song um basically

695
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,360
the same idea as a slow alaris except it

696
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,000
would send post

697
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,360
information so instead of trying to

698
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,120
gather information it would attack

699
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,240
websites that have

700
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,400
like places where you post data and

701
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,320
would send small bits of that data at a

702
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,679
time and as a result

703
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,000
would take out it would take up majority

704
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,520
of it would take up all the ports of

705
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,840
code so

706
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,440
probably should have extended further on

707
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,760
the slow larson uh rudy thing but like

708
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,960
here we have the chance we're still in

709
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,200
it so i haven't failed yet i'll get a c

710
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,200
um when it comes to actually sending the

711
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,480
data it would try to take up as many

712
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,159
ports as possible to send all this

713
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,440
little bit of information

714
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,240
and so as these resorts these ports are

715
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,280
getting clogged

716
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,440
um they'd be sitting there waiting for

717
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,960
any other information and the only other

718
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,480
connections would be like legitimate

719
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,080
connections that are already connected

720
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,919
once those connections leave it'll go

721
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,280
right in there it's basically just

722
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,480
taking up all the spots

723
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,360
as it can um it's like when you got one

724
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,559
of your mates and he's lying across the

725
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,159
couch and you're just like

726
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,080
this guy uh he's that guy but um

727
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,520
basically takes up all the spots until

728
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,600
the point where your system system the

729
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,960
website is still

730
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,200
running yet and just nobody can get into

731
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,080
it

732
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,240
because you've taken all the spots

733
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,840
you've parked every car in the parking

734
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,559
lot

735
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,520
um as i was saying this of a traditional

736
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,240
anti-dos

737
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,559
anti-dust systems due to not creating a

738
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:43,520
high enough level

739
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,120
of traffic or load packets um

740
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,400
just to sort of go into sort of more

741
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,320
stop like there's a lot of tools out

742
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,600
there there's you can you can script it

743
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,039
yourself you can script all this sort of

744
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:53,520
stuff

745
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,440
like prime example the people who made

746
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,960
these tools scripted themselves but

747
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,400
if you wanted to you could just use the

748
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,919
tools that they like it's already out

749
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,679
there there's loads of tools available

750
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:02,320
out there

751
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,039
being free open source or open source

752
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:05,600
are

753
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,480
paid for but yeah uh they're going

754
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,159
they're like ddos as a service

755
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,880
um each ddos dos 2 works in a very

756
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,000
different way some of them are

757
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,280
client-based some of them

758
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,880
are uh gui based and they use very some

759
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,240
they use a lot of different attacks some

760
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,440
of them use multiple different attacks

761
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,880
some of them only specify on certain

762
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,159
types of attacks

763
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:25,919
examples of this be the pylorus which is

764
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,840
a python script that only focuses

765
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,640
on uh slow lars attacks taurus hammer

766
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,000
which we'll look into later so i'm not

767
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,960
going to get into it

768
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,039
rudy as we mentioned did

769
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,720
which is everybody's favorite because it

770
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,159
reminds me of star wars

771
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,440
or especially my favorite because it

772
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,720
reminds me of star wars and whenever i

773
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,679
think of star wars like oh

774
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,200
there's the h ping which actually comes

775
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,120
along with uh or now it's i believe it's

776
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,320
hping3

777
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,559
you can find it on kali uh i believe it

778
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:55,919
is from what i've used it for was an

779
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,840
icmp ping when i was writing my thesis i

780
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,279
didn't attack anybody i swear it was a

781
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,720
legitimate reason

782
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,559
and there's the owasp dos http http

783
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,880
post tool i did it english um

784
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,480
so to go into the sort of the actual

785
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,799
like tools the thor's hammer which

786
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,159
um just love the name of that

787
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,480
um is a slow or low and slow http post

788
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,159
tool works a lot like uh

789
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,840
ruby is rudy as a result but it's a

790
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,360
python based script

791
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,919
it allows users to use to go to the thor

792
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:28,400
network

793
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,039
and by using native socks sockets and

794
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,799
properties proxies based within the thor

795
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:33,279
network

796
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,559
and it's completely client based um

797
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,400
what slides have moved around

798
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,000
great crack um there is the low orbital

799
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,120
on cannon forgot about that gif um

800
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,960
it's considered an entry-level tool by

801
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,320
uh by people who do the

802
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,159
sort of the dos sort of thing you know

803
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,360
do that fang

804
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,120
uh it's one of the most popular dos

805
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,799
tools out there available at the moment

806
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,480
except for it's all the brother the high

807
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,320
orbital ion cannon

808
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,159
uh created entirely in c plus plus or c

809
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:05,120
sharp sorry

810
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,320
i swear i know coding languages too look

811
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,760
we can see how much he doesn't know

812
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,960
yay um you the people who used to use it

813
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,480
formally would you would form

814
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,720
voluntary botnets by with the use of an

815
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,799
irc so people would have to

816
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,200
volunteer and to join a particular

817
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:21,840
botnet

818
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,840
and then they'd all go and have a good

819
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,600
old time breaking the law

820
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,360
um notably uses it would be true

821
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,880
anonymous that one of their

822
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,559
more notable campaigns would be like

823
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,400
operation technology

824
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,320
and operation payback which is basically

825
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,000
they took down

826
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,720
the uh church of scientology website uh

827
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,000
which i'm not going to get into because

828
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,279
i don't want to get stalked

829
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,960
and they also have the took down the

830
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,000
operation of mega upload or they they

831
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,440
did operation mega upload where they

832
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,840
took down multiple companies like umg

833
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,120
the united states department of the

834
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,440
fancy us copyright office the fbi the

835
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,480
mpaa

836
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,520
warner music group and the riaa some

837
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,440
macaroons you could tell i don't know

838
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,200
uh which basically they took that down

839
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,799
because it was a lawsuit against mega

840
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:03,679
upload and

841
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,000
anonymous believed that it was a it was

842
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,840
the infringement on the freedom

843
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,880
of uh basically of

844
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,919
art or the freedom of to gain art in the

845
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:14,480
access of

846
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,679
art um there's a http

847
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,000
unbreakable load king which i knew i was

848
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,960
forgetting someone was gonna put a

849
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,400
little king on top of it it's like

850
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,960
this is your crown my king this

851
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,240
generates a tcp

852
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,279
uh syn flood and a http flow get loads

853
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,960
written entirely in python and it can

854
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,400
help you hide the user agent when you're

855
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,760
sending all the packets

856
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,000
it sends as a sends different patterns

857
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,799
of attacks

858
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,440
and or it changes around the attack

859
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,360
actual style as to upscale the actual

860
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,799
referee for each packet

861
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,480
and it's entirely client based um

862
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,240
gotta get into some ideas of actually

863
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,679
attacks that actually took place

864
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,679
there is the github ddos attack which

865
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,520
happened about two years ago

866
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,640
uh it started at about 321

867
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,080
it used a vulnerability or i used a

868
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,919
vulnerabilities within a machine called

869
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,120
meme cache

870
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,640
or memcache with that they were able to

871
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,159
perform amplification through the port

872
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,520
one one two one one

873
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,760
uh it lasted for about eight minutes

874
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,760
github was hit about twice but the first

875
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,279
attack was a lot harder than the first

876
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,279
one it was joking there somewhere

877
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,080
and it peaked at about 1.35 terabytes

878
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,760
per second

879
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,080
um so give you an idea because i

880
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,440
realized i just said words and people

881
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,720
are just like ah yes

882
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,440
i like your wait i like your funny words

883
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,799
magic man

884
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,440
um basically an idea what actually like

885
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,600
they actually are so you you know

886
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,880
being like hey he's saying words uh

887
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,039
meme cache was an open source memory

888
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,039
caching system so basically

889
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,840
um it would sit within like a company

890
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,520
and it would be sort of like

891
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,320
an easier way to access uh stored data

892
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,799
but only store about one

893
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,720
millibyte of data at each time the

894
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,000
problem with this though

895
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,960
is that people decided let's leave it on

896
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,159
sort of an open

897
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,080
like leave of public facing which is a

898
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,679
terrible idea because there's no

899
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,840
authentication on the actual system as a

900
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,000
like because nobody ever intended the

901
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,080
creators never intended to have it

902
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,000
on uh exposed to the web gg um

903
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,320
as a result of this happen uh there were

904
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,679
so many already facing out

905
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:18,720
towards the public and they had no

906
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,480
authentication so they were ripe for the

907
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,080
spoils of all those little boys and

908
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,760
girls on christmas day

909
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,520
um so basically they would um they would

910
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,919
use the um amplification technique to

911
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,600
send little bits of data through

912
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,440
botnets and send a little bit of data to

913
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,799
these meme cache servers

914
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,000
and that would result sent a a

915
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,640
udp packets of the size of 1400 bytes to

916
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,760
whatever target they want

917
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,720
and this result being github um whatever

918
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,640
happened whatever ended up happening in

919
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,240
the end fix it fix to fix it

920
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,279
is what uh they noticed it after about a

921
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,080
few minutes

922
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,240
and what they did is they rerouted all

923
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,440
their traffic to the

924
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,399
their akami ddos scrubbing system which

925
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:57,840
basically what it does it would detect

926
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,720
all ddos

927
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,200
um packets that are coming in and would

928
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,880
drop all these packets and as a result

929
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,720
they were able to recover by about

930
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,720
5 30. um there's actually a

931
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,240
they've done an entire blog post about

932
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,600
this i would suggest looking into

933
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,000
yourself

934
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
because i've only looked over at such a

935
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,360
brief amount just to sort of get the

936
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,240
thing going

937
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,520
but it's definitely like an interesting

938
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,440
thing to look into as well

939
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,679
um they kept this rooting though through

940
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,600
that in the entire just in case it kept

941
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,039
it happened again which it ended up did

942
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,159
happening again but it was already

943
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:27,200
rooted to this so

944
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,480
they were gravy um the next one

945
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,960
is would be the aws ddos attack which

946
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,480
happened late early in the year

947
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,200
so the clouds are under attack oh god we

948
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,880
need those that's where the rain comes

949
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,440
from

950
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,039
i've just annoyed every single cloud

951
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,720
engineer and i'm so sorry

952
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,919
um i'm going to get an angry email um

953
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,240
this occurred in february 2020 right

954
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,760
during the middle of the pandemic crate

955
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,799
crack

956
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:53,039
this was a reflection attack uh it

957
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,399
carried out it carried out this attack

958
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,399
by using hijack cld ap

959
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:57,679
servers something which while i'll

960
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,320
explain what later in my lovely

961
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,000
explain what words means so people know

962
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,279
what you're talking about they're making

963
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:03,919
a braid

964
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:07,279
um it's there was a three-day elevated

965
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:08,640
threat it was it was treated as a

966
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,480
three-day elevator threat by uh

967
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,360
the aws shield and they basically what

968
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,480
they were doing they were targeting

969
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,559
active directory servers and they

970
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,919
ended up doing 2.3 terabytes per second

971
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,279
of um attack-wise but that ended up

972
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,559
getting blocked

973
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,240
and the peak of it the peak was so much

974
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,399
it was 44 larger than anything they had

975
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:29,919
actually seen before

976
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,120
um basically as i was saying

977
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,840
uh i'm saying words again and i'm just

978
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,720
people are just like

979
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,960
yes i know what those words mean uh a

980
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,840
connection

981
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,600
a connectionless light rails directory

982
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,440
access protocol or

983
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,640
clicharp or clicked app um is it's

984
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,679
designated for

985
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,080
um accessing directories are directory

986
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:50,960
services and i've

987
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,399
wrote this down because i knew i'd come

988
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:54,799
up to this did i write it down

989
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,399
it's for referencing of management

990
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,480
storage and data over ip i make great

991
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,200
notes

992
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,399
uh as i put there and the actual attack

993
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,240
would um

994
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,559
basically work as the uh amplification

995
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,080
attacker would send out

996
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,279
the it would an attacker would send out

997
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:14,000
like um data out to it and then it would

998
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,720
return the

999
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,000
well spoofing the ip and send the

1000
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,600
information out to the attack which in

1001
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,360
this place was aws

1002
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,919
uh but the thing about clouds though uh

1003
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:22,799
they can scale

1004
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,320
they can get massive you ever seen what

1005
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,679
you ever looks like you're going outside

1006
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:26,880
you're having a lovely old day and all

1007
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,399
of a sudden massive cloud it's raining

1008
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,240
not great crack basically that but

1009
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,720
computers um

1010
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,080
basically as aws plans and what they

1011
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,519
actually ended up doing as a result

1012
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:38,960
they have a plan for scaling where if

1013
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,240
they're under attack they can scale the

1014
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,600
server so big where they can just

1015
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,480
swallow

1016
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,320
the entire attack happening um they also

1017
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,360
had to make sure

1018
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,960
that all the uh connections that were

1019
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,399
going about were able to uh

1020
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,320
handle all this traffic and the server

1021
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,080
capacity was up the scale and fast

1022
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,039
enough to be able to

1023
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,039
oh that almost was the dead of a

1024
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,600
stratocaster

1025
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,159
why are you here you can stay um

1026
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:04,799
basically

1027
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,159
as i was saying before i got really

1028
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,240
interrupted um

1029
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,760
they scaled they would scale a fast and

1030
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,840
prevent resources from being used up and

1031
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,200
load balancers to prevent any

1032
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,000
overloading of any

1033
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
resources so they're able to keep it

1034
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,519
going eat the whole thing and then

1035
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,200
continue on with their merry old double

1036
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,279
aws ways

1037
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:24,480
um just to sort of give a

1038
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,919
actually can i go up to the one because

1039
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,600
i don't know how it got there she she's

1040
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,279
moving about so there's mitigation

1041
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,240
techniques

1042
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,480
right so the actual mitigating

1043
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,159
techniques that can be used would be

1044
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:35,600
as i explained with like the cloud sort

1045
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,120
of stuff i realized now that i

1046
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,159
originally had it there then five

1047
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:39,519
minutes before the actual thing i moved

1048
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:40,720
it up there and there was a reason i'm

1049
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,159
very good at this 30 hours of sleep

1050
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:43,200
don't do it kids

1051
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,720
don't try to survive on six bottles of

1052
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,200
iron brew um

1053
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,440
there is they keep four when it comes to

1054
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,880
cloud services they keep four types of

1055
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,640
response or four stages of the response

1056
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,679
would be detection

1057
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:56,000
response routing and adaption so

1058
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,799
detection would be

1059
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,559
obviously finding realizing that it's

1060
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,559
actually there so we're like oh

1061
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:03,440
oh we're under attack guys uh response

1062
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,000
would be

1063
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,679
we should do something about this so

1064
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,279
they're responding to an incoming threat

1065
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,440
like what they did with uh what github

1066
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,880
did by sending a true economy and

1067
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,159
dropping all the packets

1068
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:13,679
there and with rooting they'd root all

1069
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:14,960
the traffic away or brutally choose

1070
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,559
specific reports to break all the ddos

1071
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,080
traffic to make it more consumable for

1072
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,720
the actual

1073
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,919
um for the actual

1074
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,919
cle or the actual service and they they

1075
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,360
would do an adaption they would

1076
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,039
um they'd look at the actual attack

1077
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,240
patterns and learn from this attack

1078
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,600
pattern and be able to learn how to

1079
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,120
protect against it in ways

1080
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,559
with this there's also the ddos

1081
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,320
mitigation service which would be

1082
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,159
they'd have scalability flexibility

1083
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,399
reliability and network sizes

1084
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,679
um scalability is as i said make cloud

1085
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:42,559
go big

1086
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,279
uh flexibility is the ability to be able

1087
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,440
to adapt to incoming tracks at a time

1088
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,279
reliability is keeping the services up

1089
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,440
to a day to allow for maximum mitigation

1090
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,200
and network sizes be if you have a

1091
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,120
larger network you're harder to kill

1092
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,120
so as i go all the way back down and

1093
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,720
make this look professional as hell

1094
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,640
i have one final word to say about

1095
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,760
dawson ddos

1096
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,159
and it's a lovely song so if you're ever

1097
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,640
thinking of performing a dos or a ddos

1098
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,399
against a company or ever thinking about

1099
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,399
joining a company or joining a group

1100
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,399
that wants to do a dot here's a song for

1101
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:14,560
you

1102
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:21,839
