1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,120
right well

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,080
come back um we are now joined by james

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,920
birdser and he's going to be talking

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,639
about

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,120
uh the box in the corner not the one

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,160
that goes

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,000
beep over to you james oh thanks so much

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,560
guys and

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,640
it is an absolute pleasure to be here it

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,720
really is um so the title of this

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,240
talk it won't be particularly long but

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,160
it's the box in the corner

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,439
but not the one that uh goes beep and

14
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,359
all will be revealed pretty quickly as

15
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,760
long as he's right all right here we go

16
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,160
so um hello my name is um that's

17
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,160
something we do in the medical world

18
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,280
um because it was for a long time

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,040
we realized that people kind of started

20
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,320
prodding and poking people without

21
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,680
actually saying their name which is you

22
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,800
know really quite rude

23
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,120
um so my name is james um i currently

24
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,039
work for public health england

25
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,680
um in the covid uh response team so i'm

26
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,480
doing

27
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,199
stuff on covet at the moment i've been

28
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,000
there enhanced

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,960
paramedic in the nhs uh for 10 years and

30
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,440
i also work for the cqc as well

31
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,680
sorry my slicing to be coming off um

32
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,040
interests i've got

33
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,119
um i'm interested in motorcycling uh

34
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,799
i've fallen off twice

35
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,320
and i've only been doing it a year so

36
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,240
i'm not particularly good uh my other

37
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,400
interest is not getting covered i failed

38
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,119
miserably in

39
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,759
that as i was in hospital for nine days

40
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:20,320
with it

41
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,880
and i also support bracknell town which

42
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,680
is the

43
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,880
godzone football team i have decided um

44
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,079
yeah so why am i here because

45
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,159
i'm paramedic not really an infosec

46
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,200
person

47
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,600
the reason i'm here is a fair few years

48
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,360
ago you may have remembered

49
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,000
there was an nhs hack and i had a

50
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,640
patient

51
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,320
um that i took into hospital and

52
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,840
they needed a drug and they needed a

53
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,479
drug urgently and

54
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,280
essentially there was a big delay in

55
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,240
them getting that drug

56
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,399
and they could have died no ifs or buts

57
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,880
about it we actually had to get a porter

58
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,439
to run to the other side of the hospital

59
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,439
for the only terminal that was working

60
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,880
to print out

61
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,320
and to print out their notes so you know

62
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,399
really really kind of serious stuff and

63
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,360
because of that i

64
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,360
started to look into it and realized

65
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,680
that this is quite an important thing

66
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,800
and a really important thing in

67
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,280
healthcare

68
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,080
so this is a picture of a resuscitation

69
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,599
room you would have seen this um if

70
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,360
you're in the uk likely on casualty or

71
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,959
holby city or something like that

72
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,120
or if you've been unlikely like me you

73
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,520
may have seen it yourself

74
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,239
lots of governs around lots of things

75
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:32,959
and

76
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,120
there the arrow just shows the one thing

77
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,959
that it was pretty much connected to the

78
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,400
internet and that was the box in the

79
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,879
corner everything else goes beep

80
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,160
that didn't that was the bit the dingo

81
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,560
beep

82
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,160
and occasionally it would be used

83
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,120
sometimes it would sometimes it wouldn't

84
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,680
um and you'd get patient's notes on

85
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,879
there sometimes put stuff

86
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,720
in and that was maybe two three years

87
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,720
ago

88
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,159
maybe a year maybe two years ago

89
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,159
if you notice we would have all the

90
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,640
anaesthetic machines and such like

91
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,680
and they they would be all separate but

92
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,000
they even if they were interconnected on

93
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,760
the internet and connected

94
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,560
they wouldn't talk to each other the big

95
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,280
difference

96
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,840
is now everything that everything is

97
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,879
connected

98
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,200
um so that box in the corner now talks

99
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,200
to the anaesthetic machine

100
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,080
we uh if you look there we've got the

101
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,959
drips

102
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,360
the amount of drugs that we give even

103
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,480
the drawers

104
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,720
now when you open a drawer it will

105
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,519
actually go

106
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,480
and come on to uh the computer screen

107
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,120
and onto the

108
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,519
servers so we've got lots and lots of

109
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,599
connectivity now which is fantastic and

110
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,760
makes our life lots easier

111
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,799
and if you look we've got then um a big

112
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,000
arrow right to the bottom

113
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,280
which is out of the room and this is

114
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,439
where it gets very exciting

115
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,599
the senior clinician now so often the

116
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,000
consultant will be using lifetime

117
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,840
monitoring of vital signs

118
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,040
um so the poles saturations all of the

119
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,640
things that you would have seen that go

120
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,920
beat um we'll also use real-time

121
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,360
monitoring

122
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,959
of imaging as well say ct scans mris

123
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,399
x-rays but they will often use this

124
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,600
on and off so they might actually not

125
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,199
even be on site

126
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,840
um with full mobile device integration

127
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,320
so

128
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,320
the consultants on the golf course which

129
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,680
they often are

130
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,840
and they can start going and making

131
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,960
decisions before

132
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,639
they actually come into the hospital or

133
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,919
maybe even not come into the hospital

134
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,880
and what can also be done is is video

135
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,360
with

136
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,800
either the registrar or the senior

137
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,840
clinicians

138
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,280
um or even the patient with the vital

139
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:49,919
signs

140
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,639
being overlaid on top so they can see

141
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:53,600
what's going on

142
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,199
plus also at the same time um

143
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,240
seeing what's going on there

144
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,560
so the big question for you sort of

145
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,160
infosec clever people is

146
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,479
how many threat entry points are there

147
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:07,360
now

148
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,320
you know when that hack happened there

149
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,360
was

150
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,639
pretty much one and yeah affecting my

151
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,600
patient

152
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,160
but the reality was that that was

153
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,120
information

154
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,479
that wasn't the actual machines

155
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,800
themselves whether now

156
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,479
potentially we've got absolute shed

157
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,000
loads of entry points i'm sorry i don't

158
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,360
know what's going on with my slide so i

159
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,400
do apologize to you all

160
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,400
this stuff is really really real okay

161
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,800
really real and the last attack on

162
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,080
healthcare providers

163
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,840
um was yesterday i saw it yesterday

164
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,600
because i was very lazy and did all my

165
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,720
slacks last minute as i always do

166
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,919
and there's ransomware attack um cnn

167
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,680
reported this in the states

168
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,360
uh the cyber security and infrastructure

169
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,800
agency um

170
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,880
imminent threat to u.s healthcare

171
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,440
providers

172
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,160
nursing homes i mean nursing homes what

173
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,639
kind of evil people would go and

174
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,199
go from nursing i mean it's mind blown

175
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,280
and essentially it was blackmail

176
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,160
you know have a fee here we have a fee

177
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,400
and

178
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,919
all your computers everything can come

179
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,160
back to life oh wonderful

180
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,400
and particularly within our friends in

181
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,479
the united states and other pride

182
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,440
providers

183
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,039
that's got to be tempting that's

184
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,400
definitely got to be tempting

185
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,800
so what i want to do is to just briefly

186
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,000
put you on a real patient

187
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,360
journey and this patient um

188
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,840
i dealt with and i dealt with um

189
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,600
relatively recently

190
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,120
and this this is where technology

191
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,400
has made a huge difference to patients

192
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,719
lives

193
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,039
okay so patient journey a 59 year old

194
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:55,759
female

195
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,080
history of diabetes got no other medical

196
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,280
problems

197
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,599
and she woke up today and she had

198
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,759
breakfast sat at her desk in her home

199
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:04,560
office

200
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,120
as many of us have been during covered

201
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,919
and suddenly felt sort of slurred speech

202
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,039
and had um a right-sided weakness in her

203
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,400
face

204
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,479
her son was concerned that it was

205
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,319
basically her diabetes and her

206
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,400
did her blood sugar level and that was

207
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,160
all normal and suddenly he was like oh

208
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,440
we're in trouble here so

209
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,479
say he phoned 999 uh which is uh

210
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,199
our number for 9-1-1 for any uh um

211
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,400
people are listening in the states

212
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,759
so this is this is the big difference so

213
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,120
what would have happened before

214
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,840
is that we would have taken the 999 call

215
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,240
and

216
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,440
sent some sent someone uh directly there

217
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,879
that's what it would happen

218
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,240
now it's slightly different we received

219
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,120
the 999 call and a link is sent to the

220
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,199
smartphone of the sun

221
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,160
he then clicks on that link and has a

222
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,520
video conference

223
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,039
uh directly with a clinician a paramedic

224
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,160
in the control room

225
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,720
so that assessment starts within seconds

226
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,560
of the 999 call

227
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,919
we also use the good sam app

228
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,720
which is a free app which is available

229
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,280
to

230
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,080
activate any off-duty um clinicians in

231
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,240
the area so any doctors nurses or such

232
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:16,960
like

233
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,720
and the ambulance response car was on

234
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,039
route

235
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,680
the help arrived and then i arrived on a

236
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,960
response car and i

237
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,599
completed started to complete everything

238
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:28,720
on the electronic

239
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,680
uh clinical record which means that that

240
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,719
information

241
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,839
went straight um to the

242
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,320
um ambulance crew that were on route so

243
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,080
they can see the vital

244
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,679
signs from my monitor actually live in

245
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,440
real time

246
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,279
and we can also have that real time

247
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,880
connection to the control room where

248
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,480
we've got advanced clinicians including

249
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,360
doctors

250
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,160
and now we can have that in real time to

251
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,519
the receiving hospital

252
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,000
and that means they can start preparing

253
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,279
what they're going to do with that

254
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,160
patient

255
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,839
well before they arrive actually at

256
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,320
hospital

257
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,680
so on arrival the uh doctor went and

258
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,560
assessed

259
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,200
um sessipation and ordered an immediate

260
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,200
ct scan

261
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,000
that ct scan was again reviewed in

262
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,519
pretty much real time

263
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,160
um by a neurologist who wasn't on site

264
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,760
who's on another hospital

265
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,000
and then secondly reviewed which must be

266
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,440
done in this kind of thing

267
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,480
um outsourced to tele radiology um in

268
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,200
india which offer a 24 hour service

269
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,480
um and so so again you know

270
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,040
we're just moving data all the time they

271
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,040
were taken back to the resource area

272
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,279
and the neurologist wanted some sort of

273
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,360
further information from the patient

274
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,160
really

275
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,279
um so it was quite because this is such

276
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,720
a big drug they're going to give a

277
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,000
really big drug to

278
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,240
reduce that clot and take that clot away

279
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,640
literally bust it out the brain

280
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,800
um and if you get it wrong someone can

281
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,360
bleed to death it's very very serious

282
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,760
um so he then activated the video

283
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,560
conferencing by the bedside

284
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,040
and discussed with the patient gave a

285
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,600
little bit

286
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,519
of a further assessment and the nurse

287
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,399
gave medication

288
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,800
so if we look then actually what

289
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,880
happened to this patient they had a near

290
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,760
full reversal

291
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,399
of all of their symptoms the drug was

292
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:24,959
given

293
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,279
90 minutes from the onset of the start

294
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,640
of the stroke

295
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,279
and i'm quite sure that a lot of the

296
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,200
reason that the drug was given so

297
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,800
quickly is because they had

298
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,079
all the live data and information at the

299
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,040
time

300
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,600
so they were in a position where they

301
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,720
weren't thinking

302
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,360
oh maybe maybe not maybe i should give

303
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,279
this drug or let's go and see

304
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,880
they started to prepare literally

305
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,880
from the 999 calls so before our arrival

306
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,200
um they were discharged two days later

307
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,320
um and

308
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,399
they were back at work completely uh

309
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,240
within five weeks

310
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,600
after their original stroke

311
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,360
so looking at something like that that

312
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,720
is obviously

313
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,800
really exciting for us and it's it's

314
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,079
it's great it's it's

315
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,040
making life better and it's making um

316
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,560
patients lives better

317
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,920
and it's saving lives but there is also

318
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,640
a risk

319
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,120
and and as we talked about earlier those

320
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,720
threat points now

321
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,600
are clouds you know we've we're now

322
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,560
going on the cloud

323
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,920
we're we are moving um

324
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,760
we're moving patients all the time and

325
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,519
that data is going around the place

326
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,240
really private private data of you know

327
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,680
the thing that we hold may steer which

328
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,360
is our medical records

329
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,480
um so what i've got here on this slide

330
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,920
is all of the people that work for the

331
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,680
national health service and i've tried

332
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,000
to

333
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
try to remember as many as i can and it

334
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,920
is it is tricky and i definitely would

335
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,240
have

336
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,279
would have sort of failed in a few but

337
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,839
when you talk about

338
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,680
when you talk about i.t and you talk

339
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,279
about infosec and this sort of thing

340
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,399
with colleagues

341
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,639
it's very much seen as

342
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,839
as they are the um they're the i.t

343
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,680
department they're the people that are

344
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,600
in a box somewhere and probably the help

345
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,440
desk and they pick up the phone and say

346
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,959
have you turned it on and off again you

347
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,320
know and all right you forgot your

348
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,680
password

349
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,120
whether actually i think the infosec

350
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,519
and the industry now needs to be

351
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,399
completely

352
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,680
and utterly part of the nhs

353
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,800
whether that is is on a private setting

354
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,839
and whether that's

355
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,079
sort of subcontracted or whether that's

356
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,839
working directly for the national health

357
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:40,560
service

358
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,240
which is free at the point of views um

359
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,639
in the uk and the reason being is that

360
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,639
we've got these threats we've now got

361
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,920
so many open open areas

362
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,959
that can be that can be affected and

363
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,959
this is a real real challenge and

364
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,320
something that needs to be taken very

365
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,440
very seriously

366
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,880
and during covert and all these

367
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,040
challenges that we've got

368
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,399
if you know if we get a hack

369
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,760
on top of covid and on top

370
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,639
of the um horrendous situation that

371
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,880
we're in and over winter it is going to

372
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,279
be

373
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,560
horrendous that many many people could

374
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,519
die

375
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,320
so what i want to say is just a huge

376
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,440
massive thanks

377
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,440
and a massive thanks to your industry

378
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,360
because

379
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,120
whether you're working directly in

380
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,360
healthcare or whatever you're doing

381
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,839
you're part of the solution that is

382
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:36,240
stopping that is stopping horrendous

383
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,240
attacks on our health service

384
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,839
and therefore you are stopping basically

385
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,199
you're a part of the team that's

386
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,000
stopping people having worse health and

387
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,480
potentially even dying and it is as

388
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,600
serious as that

389
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,560
and you know in america say yesterday

390
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,600
they found that out

391
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,279
so i very much want to thank all of you

392
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,519
for for what you do and the thing is

393
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,240
what's so difficult about what you do

394
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,880
is when it goes wrong my goodness the

395
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,240
press and everything else

396
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,720
will go and be on your backs and saying

397
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,760
how you know why

398
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,399
wasn't this done and why why didn't

399
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,079
didn't this get stopped but what they're

400
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:14,800
not gonna do

401
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,760
is that when when you get it right

402
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,360
nobody's gonna say thank you so

403
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,000
from me and from probably hopefully all

404
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,519
of my clinician friends that kind of

405
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,519
know about this stuff a little bit

406
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,279

talk and certainly some very sobering

423
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:03,440
thoughts to

424
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,959
to think about um so i i have a few

425
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,720
questions i think scott may have

426
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,560
but there is one question um from twitch

427
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,320
uh from binary sniper uh what security

428
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,920
awareness training do you get

429
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,120
and do you think it's sufficient i'm so

430
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,680
sorry i

431
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,160
unfortunately someone went through my

432
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,600
internet cable this morning

433
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,760
so i'm actually using cellular which is

434
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,519
terrible so i just missed the question

435
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,959
i'm so sorry

436
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,759
all good um what sort of security

437
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:34,800
awareness training

438
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,920
uh do uh nh employees get and do you

439
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,680
think it's sufficient

440
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,399
that is a fantastic question sean and

441
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,120
it's absolutely not sufficient which you

442
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,120
you won't be probably surprised that i'm

443
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,240
saying and

444
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,560
it's it's pretty much put in information

445
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,279
governance

446
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,040
we do a um what it's online

447
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,160
training which in in all honesty is

448
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,160
get your mate and the person that's done

449
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,600
it before you and got the

450
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,440
the full marks and yeah there we go and

451
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,959
give him a biscuit and a cup of tea

452
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,360
and he does it for you um that's the

453
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,320
reality

454
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,800
um it's it's about passwords oh make

455
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,079
sure your password's changed

456
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,040
occasionally

457
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,759
um and put put an explanation mark in it

458
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,360
that is the extent

459
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,399
of the security training um

460
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,800
that's it that's it pretty much and they

461
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,639
might say put an antivirus on

462
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,160
their reason that isn't the awareness of

463
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,560
threat and there isn't the awareness of

464
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,160
you know what can happen

465
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,800
if you stick your usb stick in and it

466
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,160
comes from the wrong place whatever

467
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,680
there's just not the awareness there at

468
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,639
all

469
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,240
yeah i mean when i had my two kids

470
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,120
we all often left in a room um totally

471
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,000
unattended

472
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,360
door shuts for a minute that like you

473
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,000
talking

474
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,560
hours sometimes on end there was a pc

475
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,920
sat on the corner there

476
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,759
that that one pc that you're talking

477
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,800
about and i had full access to it if i

478
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,759
really wanted to

479
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,040
so yeah um what are your thoughts around

480
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,039
uh sort of

481
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,720
obviously the the attacks coming from

482
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,160
the outside but what about the inside

483
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,640
attacks

484
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,280
such as in that scenario absolutely i

485
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,880
think it's i think it's a great great

486
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,520
point

487
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,640
if you look at our my friends and our

488
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,079
friends that work in the ministry of

489
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,119
defense

490
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,760
um you know the biggest no-no is

491
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,119
charging your phone

492
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:27,679
um on a usb that is an absolute no-no

493
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,760
and you do it and you're gonna have a

494
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,440
meeting without coffee with kind of a

495
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,039
company commander or such like

496
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,480
it is no don't do it usbs you know they

497
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,799
cannot be brought into an mod site

498
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,440
but i think when i was a student i think

499
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,200
they gave me a usb i think it was just

500
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,480
kind of like oh there you go

501
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,440
um stuck it on the you know on the on

502
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,200
the lanyard so

503
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,760
there isn't the awareness at all and

504
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,640
essentially

505
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,880
if you did want to cause problems

506
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,000
internally

507
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,559
it would be very very easy without doubt

508
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,160
i mean even to the point where

509
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,440
i have seen before um the data cards

510
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,840
which is to get the page your most

511
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,480
uh private patient information and you

512
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:08,960
have a

513
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,720
a data card with the

514
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,840
chip in it sort of thing um and that

515
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,960
data card

516
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,960
uh people just leave it they just they

517
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,400
leave they leave it in the thing

518
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,840
because it's like oh their mate goes and

519
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,840
uses it and it does happen

520
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,520
it really does happen because it's a bit

521
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,880
of a pain to log out

522
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,559
log in oh there you go use mine while i

523
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,440
go to luke it's not good

524
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,799
yeah um the excellent points um

525
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,440
so there is another question in twitch

526
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:37,840
uh

527
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,679
how do you recommend getting clinics in

528
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,840
the door for awareness training

529
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,080
i think in reality awareness training

530
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,039
and and increasing it within within

531
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,080
healthcare

532
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,120
it's going to be about to to put a finer

533
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,240
point on it it's going to be when their

534
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,160
bottoms are burnt

535
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,960
because that's when things are done and

536
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,280
the everything quite rightly the focus

537
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,320
is on covered now

538
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,320
you know i mean i'm not i'm not by any

539
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,600
means saying that

540
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,799
it shouldn't be but

541
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,919
that's surely to our

542
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,679
our enemies and they are enemies you

543
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,600
know i really believe that

544
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,799
um they are going to take advantage of

545
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:23,520
that

546
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,919
you know if we're extremely busy or

547
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,160
things are things are a big problem

548
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,840
that's when surely they're going to take

549
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,320
advantage so i feel that now is the time

550
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,880
when we really need to be on our game

551
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,240
um and treating this extremely seriously

552
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,520
um so so i think unfortunately to the

553
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,160
really good question i think the reality

554
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,720
is

555
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,919
that it will be um when there's another

556
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:48,559
attack

557
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,840
and and people are hurt actually

558
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,640
unfortunately

559
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,360
yeah i i totally agree and unfortunately

560
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,799
those that we're dealing with

561
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,000
don't really have a great moral compass

562
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,200
is one way of putting it so it is uh

563
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,159
something that certainly concerns me um

564
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,480
scott do you have any questions

565
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,400
uh no it's just basically bouncing off

566
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,000
of what james has just

567
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,080
literally just said um i've done

568
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,679
training sessions at the nhs

569
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,440
and they lap it up

570
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,600
but under on one or two specific

571
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,679
requirements and that is they're not

572
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,280
overloaded with work and they can

573
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,200
actually attend their stuff and they

574
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,679
do take in and then secondarily to that

575
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,120
obviously you've got

576
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,799
management understanding this is

577
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,640
important we need to pay for this or

578
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,679
or schedule time for it um but no

579
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,240
i i think it's absolutely spot on about

580
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,280
um

581
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,600
when you reference you know the the kind

582
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,200
of heartless motive that sean literally

583
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,400
just touched on it

584
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,520
about you know people targeting critical

585
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,720
systems or

586
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,720
or i think you brought the nursing home

587
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,840
example that's

588
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,240
pretty horrendous and just now you think

589
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,760
about the number of nursing homes that

590
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,600
are having to adapt to

591
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,679
using technology they're not qualified

592
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,440
to use they're not trained in

593
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,960
um and i mean that in the nicest

594
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,120
possible way they're having to adapt to

595
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:07,919
kovid's

596
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,919
um i mean you're seeing it from the

597
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,280
inside which is

598
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,919
post 381 and twitch literally just said

599
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:14,640
you know

600
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,200
getting an insight to an industry that

601
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,200
we see it from one angle only you're

602
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,520
you're in the unique position james you

603
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,120
see it from both angles now which is

604
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,000
great

605
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,960
but adapting to the covered situation

606
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,960
with that insight of

607
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,760
infosec and healthcare are you seeing a

608
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,039
lot of stuff you're like ah

609
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,120
this this is going to end badly this is

610
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,960
going in badly are you seeing a lot of

611
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,919
that

612
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,159
absolutely because as i said you know

613
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,039
we've got

614
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,880
it's fantastic the technology that we're

615
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,360
using you know it's awesome the cloud

616
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,000
staff

617
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,919
and the video conferencing you know it

618
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,080
is making a huge difference we are

619
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,880
getting

620
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,559
we're getting experts and let's be

621
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:53,840
honest you know there's only so many

622
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,520
neurosurgeons in the world you know you

623
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,559
can't just build

624
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,400
you can't go and just get a brain

625
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,679
surgeon off of the

626
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,919
off the shelf so whether we like it or

627
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:02,720
not

628
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,360
this is absolute essential stuff we need

629
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,080
to be

630
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,880
um the only way to have someone in two

631
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,000
places at once

632
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,960
is using this technology and i think

633
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,520
sort of

634
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,520
to answer your question the thing that

635
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,880
scares me is

636
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,200
that there's just so many entry points

637
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,080
now there's so

638
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,120
big big possible threats and

639
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,840
it's uh it's a situation where nobody's

640
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,720
talking about it

641
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,280
really um it just feels that they're not

642
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,640
talking about it and

643
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,799
when when there's a hack then yeah

644
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,400
absolutely everyone's talking about it

645
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,679
and they're talking about it for

646
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,000
you know a couple of days maybe a week

647
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,280
um and this

648
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,039
this scares the heck out of me you know

649
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,120
i mean imagine in worst case scenario

650
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:43,760
i'm talking

651
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,679
absolute worst case scenario that

652
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,679
someone goes and hacks into systems at

653
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:48,640
nightingale

654
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,840
you know i mean with with vast quantity

655
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,760
of people on ventilators

656
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,080
i mean that scares the living bejesus

657
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,039
out of me to be honest with you it

658
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,520
really does

659
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,799
yeah but i totally agree i mean

660
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,960
scares me from my family point of view

661
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,240
so um

662
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,520
then yeah as well as the wider community

663
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,080
in that

664
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,960
um james thank you so much excellent
