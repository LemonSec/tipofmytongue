developers

8
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,119

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,800
cocaine and caviar

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,160
and conditions before we start

20
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,559
there was no class a distributed or

21
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:49,200
consumed

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,199
in the making of these slides and i do

23
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,320
not enjoy

24
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,760
the use of drugs because drugs are bad

25
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,520
okay so uh hello thanks for being here

26

uh just some disclaimers it is my first

28
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,360
talk you'll probably not learn anything

29
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,600
and it's weird of [ __ ] with no audience

30
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,280
uh i don't know why i'm

31
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,040
more nervous that there's no audience

32
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,360
than just talking to my laptop

33
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,000
um so and a huge shout out to the

34

49
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,000
just nerves

52
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,520
so let's let's let's see shall we so

53
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,639
i'm ash clam i'm a fiancee to

54
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,920
beth a pet hoarder and infosec analyst

55
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,040
by day

56
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,440
i was developer for five years and still

57
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,520
do my free time

58
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,800
uh i'm in the security for just under a

59
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,440
year

60
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,080
and i've been in it for seven years so

61
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,080
pretty much since i left school

62
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,720
um i've started about 476 projects and

63
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,920
maybe finished two or three uh i break a

64
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,680
lot of [ __ ] and websites

65
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,040
servers remote control stuff computers

66
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,840
networks but there's a plot twist where

67
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,400
i also

68
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,680
built some of it and i help out on the

69
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,800
covered the side volunteers 19 group so

70
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,800
i shouted to the to the whole team over

71
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,840
there and

72
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,640
they're all amazing

73
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,519
cool

74
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,879
and then here's just what i get up to in

75
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,879
my free time um

76
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,360
some of the pets that we have and me

77
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,640
riding

78
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,359
my donkey

79
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,120
my ugly chihuahua p

80
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,080
so enough of me so here's the the fun

81
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,200
time

82
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,319
and here's the plan of action so we've

83
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,519
done the intro

84
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,400
the [ __ ] talking's nearly over we've got

85
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,480
a little bit more [ __ ] talking to do

86
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,879
uh i'll run a little bit and do some

87
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:29,599
reasoning

88
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,519
and then i'll realize i've produced a

89
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,840
completely useless talk for everyone

90
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,280
um and then we'll get into some

91
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,159
questions afterwards

92
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,239
okay so you're wondering why you're here

93
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,319
i wanted to just share my knowledge and

94
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,680
help companies from getting

95
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,799
owned um that's kind of what we all do

96
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,159
out here and

97
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,400
one part i'm not getting on is to focus

98
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,920
on the engine room behind

99
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,519
your apps and websites which is

100
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,640
obviously your developers

101
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,959
and what's one of the biggest assets to

102
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,159
most companies

103
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,400
of course it'll be their websites

104
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,879
okay and the precious developers are

105
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,439
almost

106
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,480
often left in the basement and as always

107
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,000
they're the most important asset

108
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,159
but never get the credit but we don't do

109
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,599
stuff for the credit because we just

110
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,478
love

111
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,238
we do it due for the passion and the

112
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,279
love of building websites

113
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,360
okay and there's some weird

114
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,560
misconceptions in security so the weird

115
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,919
misconceptions are

116
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,800
developers don't care about security and

117
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,160
uh

118
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,720
i don't know about you but i hear it all

119
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,600
over the place

120
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,360
so i was convinced myself that

121
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,280
developers didn't care about security

122
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,639
even being a developer myself up until

123
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,080
i was getting a little bit more

124
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,680
experienced in the development world

125
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,280
that was in the early days

126
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,040
and i always had people telling me and

127
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,400
still do that developers

128
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,000
do not care about security and don't

129
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,520
take it seriously

130
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,160
so do you think that developers don't

131
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,040
have to meet

132
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,600
aggressive deadlines they have

133
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,080
functional tests to pass

134
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,720
building user friendly applications

135
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,120
making their applications super duper

136
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,120
fast and high quality with

137
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,280
object oriented code readable for every

138
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,639
person on the planet

139
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,240
and the list goes on and on my point is

140
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,280
developers do care about security but

141
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,440
there is a hundred thousand other things

142
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,720
they need to think about

143
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,320
kind of like with any job um

144
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,800
so most of these misconceptions can come

145
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,160
from the top down

146
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,080
so you're probably wondering what the

147
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,639
[ __ ] i'm talking about so sometimes

148
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,199
it will come from the top down and it

149
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:41,759
all

150
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,320
almost likely come from the managers

151
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,440
non-devs you

152
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,360
oversee a development team and it

153
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,080
happens a lot um

154
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,800
there's some actions that are probably

155
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,039
well it's part of my talk which i'd like

156
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:55,600
to

157
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,240
just share my advice and another

158
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,440
disclaimer um

159
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,680
it's my completely own opinion from my

160
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,479
experience

161
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,039
i'm not an expert i'm just offering my

162
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,000
my two cents

163
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,800
to the subject

164
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,600
okay

165
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,759
so uh my advice first bit of advice

166
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,560
so understand your developers do care

167
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,039
about security

168
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,400
also getting your head there it's not

169
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,160
the only thing i need to worry about

170
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,680
uh it comes back to the bus

171
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,919
versus leader debate i'm not sure if

172
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:32,880
other people have

173
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,080
um come across it but got me a message

174
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,199
in the uh

175
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,400
the chat for some questions about that

176
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,520
and um it comes down to many factors so

177
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,000
developers want secure applications and

178
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,440
if they don't then i'm not sure why

179
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,240
they've been

180
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,319
developers but by showing your

181
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,440
developers that you

182
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,520
understand that security is part of the

183
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,639
card in

184
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,560
the big machine that they have rather

185
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,120
than just an overhanging burden

186
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,280
it should significantly add more trust

187
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,800
and cooperation

188
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,360
with between you and your team uh and

189
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,120
this doesn't just apply to security

190
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,120
for understanding that developers have a

191
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,039
lot of other things to think about

192
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,240
um we'll just add more trust between the

193
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,120
teams

194
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,960
so be less of a boss and more of a

195
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,799
leader is the point of making there

196
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,680
advice number two get clued up so

197
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,199
many managers and leaders of development

198
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,479
teams should

199
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,199
and must have conversations on how

200
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,960
security fits in with

201
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,199
their other priorities of developers so

202
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,400
by this i mean that

203
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,560
developers should be trained to

204
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,800
understand security enough to have

205
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,280
conversations about security in your

206
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,479
applications

207
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,080
so if the developer doesn't understand

208
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,759
security they can't obviously

209
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,960
talk or fix security issues um

210
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,080
unless they were trained to do so um

211
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,400
it's also really really important you do

212
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,639
not neglect the security training for

213
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,479
yourself and fellow managers if you are

214
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,160
one and leaders of

215
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,280
development teams etc um and again it's

216
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,960
a double-edged sword so

217
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,440
you must also train the security team

218
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,680
and the security experts in your company

219
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,800
or vendors

220
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,599
on how development works so maybe

221
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:18,080
they're

222
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,319
showing them the basics like software

223
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,919
development life cycles

224
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,680
um or the 400 page policy document on

225
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,160
how

226
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,800
development runs in your firm and it's

227
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,160
really up to you

228
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,200
but having the security team um

229
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,640
educated on how uh the development works

230
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,000
how your pipelines

231
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,240
etc should also work hand in hand with

232
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,679
teaching developers on

233
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,959
how security works um and

234
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,959
how do you expect a security

235
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,279
professional to be a developer

236
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,200
through a security issue if you don't

237
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,440
understand the basics of development

238
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,560
that's that's the kind of point i'm

239
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,040
getting there and it's it's like a

240
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,200
it's a lot like watching the psa trying

241
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,080
to convince

242
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,920
a class of primary school kids on

243
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,519
quantum physics

244
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,640
so it's it's kind of like

245
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,839
and the training will help you get more

246
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:10,720
productive

247
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,279
and have more productive uh discussions

248
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,560
about security

249
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,040
and in the end it will lead to better

250
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,959
teamwork and a better all

251
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,760
uh overall better security which is what

252
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,320
you want

253
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,480
oh

254
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,519
so the final bit of advice after

255
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,399
rabbiting on

256
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,760
um this is where you give the developers

257
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,680
cocaine and caviar so give them

258
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,399
everything um

259
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,040
i hope you have read regular catch-ups

260
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,640
with your devs teams

261
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,519
and uh in terms of their progress and

262
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,200
career development if not i'll give you

263
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,560
that tip for free

264
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,320
um anywho give your developers

265
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,760
the tools they need to handle the easy

266
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,399
per se part of security so all of your

267
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,240
low-hanging fruits like your sql

268
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,120
injections

269
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,000
and uh your cross-site script and that

270
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,440
can be arranged

271
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,680
that can be provided for a range of

272
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,480
tooling

273
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,240
and ide so you have some ideas out there

274
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:10,640
that are

275
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,320
specifically built for adding plugins in

276
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,760
which you can help detect

277
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,279
these low-hanging fruits and uh

278
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,399
that'll be one step in

279
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,519
securing your applications but you

280
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,440
give them the tools they need to

281
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,360
automate the low-hanging fruit which is

282
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,120
just on about

283
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,839
but in the end automation is not the

284
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,360
magic wallet so giving them all the

285
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,920
tools isn't the magic bullet to

286
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,519
not getting your application owned um

287
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,200
they are powerful options and they can

288
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,959
greatly reduce the risk of security

289
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,000
threats

290
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,200
but um again

291
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,279
it won't fix all of the issues and it

292
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,519
does require developers to be educated

293
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:53,920
on

294
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,480
security so that's where the cocaine and

295
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,680
caviar comes in

296
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,000
so the figure of speech where you need

297
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,120
to give them everything

298
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,279
um some of the tools can include

299
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,600
training which can be on the secure

300
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,000
coding workshops

301
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,440
send them away on courses practice labs

302
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,560
pentester academy has a few different

303
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,000
secure coding things you can uh offer so

304
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,720
there's loads of resource out there

305
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,000
providing them with

306
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,800
concise practice guides

307
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,600
[Music]

308
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,360
and showing them how security works

309
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,600
around their application so maybe how

310
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,040
their service hosted

311
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,959
and all that sort of stuff so again it

312
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,720
comes down to education

313
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,000
um and then that just results

314
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,240
in giving you um

315
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,600
a a baseline to go off where you've

316
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,880
covered your baseline security issues

317
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,200
and

318
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,279
and it's up to developers to

319
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,279
to not be lazy and code securely um

320
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,120
but guess what giving your developers

321
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,959
these tools should

322
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,440
or could free up your pressure security

323
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,360
experts or professionals in your team to

324
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,240
help with

325
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,240
the more challenging issues in your work

326
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,720
like closing rdp ports or

327
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,680
on securing their servers rather than

328
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,959
lecturing the developers all the time

329
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,720
so the biggest tool you could probably

330
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,200
learn

331
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,320
is failure and failure is possibly the

332
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,480
most useful tool to learn

333
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,079
um by that uh learning is a

334
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,440
good thing um learning from those

335
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,000
failures

336
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,120
will stop you from doing stupid

337
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,600
[ __ ] when you're building websites so if

338
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,040
your app gets breached

339
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,760
it's possible um yes your developers

340
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,639
should open up

341
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,440
and if they have shortcuts some corners

342
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:51,839
uh

343
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,360
when coding and um well that that's

344
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,680
that's for you to deal with but

345
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,480
in the end learning that you've had

346
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,519
these issues

347
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,360
and you've maybe you've got 20 other

348
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,880
applications that

349
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,000
have been coded a similar way that will

350
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,160
almost certainly stop that issue from

351
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,600
um being a problem again again it's not

352
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,040
a magic bullet and it probably won't

353
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,000
stop it but

354
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,560
at least it will make you aware of a

355
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,480
security issue and you can fix it across

356
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,920
other

357
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,560
uh applications and also your developer

358
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,920
will learn from it again

359
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,440
the failures the the key part so failure

360
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,560
is learning um

361
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,079
to reduce failure is where the

362
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,000
automation of tools come in so

363
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,040
giving them the training courses and the

364
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,000
tooling they need

365
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
so that should stop the the silly coding

366
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,480
but

367
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,199
it it almost certainly won't it's just

368
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,240
there as a

369
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,920
helping or guide um

370
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,120
so yeah just uh my point is failure is a

371
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,320
good thing uh

372
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,399
even if they didn't sanitize their input

373
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,460
fields

374
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,279
[Music]

375
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,880
um so what next so now i've wasted the

376
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,519
last

377
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,120
i don't know 20 minutes or so if that

378
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,639
um of your life well the point i wanted

379
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,320
to get across

380
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,880
was um developers did give a [ __ ] about

381
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,760
security

382
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,800
um but they most likely lack the

383
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,639
training needed to effectively

384
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,160
incorporate security into their

385
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,120
developing

386
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,040
um when they try to incorporate security

387
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,959
into application they re

388
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,279
get the gatekeepers in security punish

389
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,959
them punish them for asking

390
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,880
why or um they get pushback from

391
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,959
managers from

392
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,079
uh maybe saying you shouldn't have done

393
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:50,800
this or

394
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,880
you shouldn't have coded a certain

395
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,680
component this way so again it comes

396
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,000
down

397
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,800
from the the the top down so from your

398
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,440
managers

399
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,920
and leadership pushing pushing your

400
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,360
developers back um

401
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,639
i'd embrace people asking questions and

402
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,160
um people being curious is the

403
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,440
the best thing you can probably have in

404
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,839
your team um

405
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,639
so in conclusion uh

406
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,920
all of most web app most

407
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,800
app security can be solved through uh

408
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,320
education and

409
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,759
educating your developers with uh

410
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,920
a wise usage of tools can give them

411
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,600
um the knowledge and

412
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,000
obviously tools they need to to help

413
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,839
secure your applications which

414
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,279
is ultimately what you want um so yeah

415
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,360
please give your developers cocaine and

416
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,000
caviar

417
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,959
uh on tap it'll improve your security

418
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,600
and the overall relationship within

419
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,360
the team um so now the security team and

420
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,040
application team can

421
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,720
kiss and hold hands while you get your

422
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,320
new application built and

423
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,839
everyone can ride it off into the sunset

424
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,079
happy

425
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,360
um i would love to

426
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,360
thank you all for listening uh to me

427
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,800
rabbit on for

428
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,399
uh i don't know how long i've been

429
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,000
talking uh

430
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
and you can connect with me on twitter

431
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,279

432
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,240
posted there uh i'd love to chat to you

433
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:24,959
all so just

434
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,320
drop me a dm um and a huge thanks to the

435
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,440
beer farmers for

436
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,560
giving me the opportunity and then last

437
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,839
thing is

438
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,040
questions all right ash

439
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,360
yeah thanks man really appreciate that

440
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,720
brilliant talk

441
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,279
um a question from the room that i've

442
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,000
spotted

443
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,519
um from stew

444
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,079
and i wonder even if he's aiming this

445
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,440
question at me

446
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,920
rather than at you but i'll ask you the

447
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,519
question

448
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,839
so a lot of developers are actually

449
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,040
actively

450
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,279
engaged and interested in the concepts

451
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,399
of security

452
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,400
you know a wasp and all that kind of

453
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,319
thing but often

454
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,720
they're not given the the space and the

455
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,160
latitude and the time

456
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,359
to go away and learn about it so

457
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,319
on the one hand we can't criticize devs

458
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,599
for not caring about the quality of

459
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,039
their software from a security point of

460
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,480
view but on the other hand we don't

461
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,760
necessarily give them all the

462
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,000
opportunity to

463
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,319
do things better so i wonder what your

464
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,919
thoughts are on that

465
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,280
um yeah so this has come up in meetings

466
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,880
at work where

467
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,919
um again it's it's about it's about the

468
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,000
the the pile of work that's given i

469
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,080
guess and the pressure from that work

470
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,039
and i mostly see

471
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,559
in um from my experience is the market

472
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:45,360
inside of

473
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,840
the industry so uh i've worked for

474
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,039
marketing agencies

475
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:52,080
and in a marketing agency that pressures

476
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,720
on to do just developing all the time

477
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,960
just to clear off the projects and

478
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,320
um yes you need to to follow owasp

479
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,679
concepts and

480
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,320
um all that sort of stuff but the the

481
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,480
pressure of just getting the job done

482
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,679
um is too much and i've had meetings

483
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:10,080
with

484
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,520
uh managers and team leaders myself

485
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,559
as a senior developer a company and

486
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,280
said look we need on a couple of hours

487
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,640
on a friday afternoon

488
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,280
once every two weeks um maybe we could

489
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,799
build a workshop every

490
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,120
every week just for a couple of hours at

491
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,000
the end of the day

492
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,880
and we can teach these concepts and that

493
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,080
was

494
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,039
once a understood security myself and i

495
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:35,520
seen

496
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,640
where it was lacking in the security

497
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,440
of the building of applications if that

498
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,559
makes sense

499
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,679
yeah makes public sense um

500
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,400
i guess to your point about management

501
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,600
so what are your thoughts

502
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,840
on how a developer that may find a bug

503
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,640
or a security analyst that finds a bug

504
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,360
and then

505
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,480
speaks to a developer about it and then

506
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,559
between them they agree it's a problem

507
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,320
what are your experiences or thoughts on

508
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,679
how you get that information

509
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,320
up up the chain to get people to

510
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,160
actually care about it

511
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,440
um so so my approach has

512
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,559
kind of just been direct so i i've kind

513
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,320
of hurt some people in the process so

514
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,120
i'd bypass

515
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,799
the team leader and the manager and i'll

516
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,840
just go straight to the person who

517
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,000
who he's able to make the decision so

518
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,559
if if you've got if you feel like

519
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,080
there's issues with

520
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,919
um how an app is being developed

521
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,320
or if you feel like something's lacking

522
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,679
in uh

523
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,799
the websites then obviously i'd speak to

524
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,799
the team leader about it and most of the

525
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,720
time that wouldn't really go anywhere so

526
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,120
i'd give it a couple of weeks and maybe

527
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,360
um

528
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,600
nothing had made progress so i'd just go

529
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,960
straight up to

530
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,080
my manager or his boss and

531
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,520
and pitch it from there i would have

532
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,520
made a few slides and

533
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,360
and pitched a new idea of implementing

534
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,640
xor changing

535
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,919
um changing the way we build uh

536
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,120
some component we've developed all right

537
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,080
fair enough

538
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,640
um a quick question from gls so what is

539
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,840
the coolest thing you broke

540
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,480
um there's

541
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,200
there's been quite a few things if

542
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,960
honestly there's almost every single

543
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,679
website

544
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,840
i've built i've broke something on there

545
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,960
um

546
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,159
i've probably lost uh

547
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,159
i think just over a million pounds worth

548
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,679
of actual money

549
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,200
um website and uh

550
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,220
that wasn't fun i also caused uh

551
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,520
[Music]

552
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,280
uh the um ico to get involved with a

553
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,799
website because i left

554
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,280
debugging i'm turned on on one of the

555
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,559
websites and

556
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,240
it was christmas and none was in the

557
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,679
office and

558
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,240
uh the database password and username

559
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,120
was

560
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,320
in that debug file um in the end it was

561
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,039
a good job

562
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,559
we had to whitelist our piece to the

563
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,799
database but uh yeah that was my

564
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,240
christmas ruined um

565
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,400
probably three years ago now i don't

566
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,320
know you live and learn right

567
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,880
yes so absolutely

568
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,880
does anybody else in the uh in the room

569
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,720
have a question for ashore

570
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,880
yeah yeah sorry sean do you want to go

571
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,440
first or

572
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,039
oh you're good sean's having a moment

573
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,520
sean is having a moment um cool i i just

574
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,960
want to say see the humility and been

575
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,080
able to turn around and say

576
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,000
yeah yeah i broke all this tons of [ __ ]

577
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,240
here i did this and i did that

578
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,720
that's awesome you know what it's a

579
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,400
learning episode i don't trust people

580
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,200
that say

581
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,640
yeah i can do that and i've never made a

582
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,640
mistake because i'm like you

583
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,799
you you have and you just don't want to

584
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,000
admit it or you don't

585
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,840
realize you've made a mistake and that's

586
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,440
worse um

587
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,960
just a couple of comments and what you'd

588
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,799
you've put up um developer

589
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:06,159
five years security for about a year

590
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,240
it for seven years um that broad

591
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,840
experience has given you a lot of

592
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,120
different outlooks and i think that's

593
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,640
given you this perfect sort of idea and

594
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,840
scope to go

595
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,559
this is why it's important to give your

596
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:23,520
developers

597
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,280
whatever they want even if that's

598
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,840
cocaine and caviar

599
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,799
yeah yeah no yeah that's what the point

600
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:31,840
wanted to get across

601
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,799
um i've i've been in plenty of companies

602
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,480
where it's

603
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,000
the the education is

604
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,840
lacking so yeah it is up to the

605
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,840
developer to

606
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,960
in my opinion developers should

607
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,919
when i've interviewed people to hire uh

608
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,679
one of the first questions always ask

609
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,039
which is kind of

610
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,840
um my deciding answer is do you do stuff

611
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,640
at home

612
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,039
if they don't then i don't believe that

613
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,039
they'd be a great asset to the company

614
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:01,840
if they

615
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,720
it it's kind of like um i'm not sure if

616
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,000
it happens in other industries but um if

617
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,400
i

618
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,679
get the feeling that people are doing

619
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,919
stuff at home then they'd

620
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,320
be able to bring a lot more to the team

621
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,919
um

622
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,120
when when they come on board and again

623
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,640
it doesn't just stop there so yeah they

624
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,320
should be doing stuff at home but they

625
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:22,960
all should be

626
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,799
also should be given the tools um

627
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,360
around security so i know maybe getting

628
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,480
them to use both

629
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,840
um when they're making apis and testing

630
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,280
the endpoints or

631
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,559
uh when they're making a new form um

632
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,159
maybe teaching them how to use but yes

633
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:41,840
it's extra work but

634
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,559
it's steps in order to stop someone else

635
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,640
from doing that and finding a hole

636
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,360
um it's it's worked quite well in the

637
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,320
past with

638
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,000
implementing it with teams yes it's

639
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,600
extended the

640
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,480
the lifetime of a project or the the

641
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,880
completion date of a project but

642
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,360
um rather than just shipping out there

643
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,960
as fast as possible i think it's good

644
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,039
just to clear off the basics

645
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,559
and and yeah

646
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,039
i fully agree couldn't agree more um

647
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,080
genuinely just

648
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,600
you you were like ah this is gonna be a

649
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,760
[ __ ] no it you're [ __ ]

650
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,240
everything you've said is spot on so

651
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,000
yeah massive kudos to you for that

652
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,600
sean i think you want to jump in

653
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,240
yeah i want to tell us something so yeah

654
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,039
great talk

655
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,000
um so one of the things i've seen i've

656
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,120
been in this

657
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,440
position of trying to do security to

658
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,400
developers

659
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,080
and i've seen many companies actually do

660
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,679
this is you

661
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,400
will do this training and it's kind of

662
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,520
the training that

663
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,240
is probably less painful than oh it's

664
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:44,880
more pain

665
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,960
or sorry less painful to stick a fork in

666
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,120
your eye then do some of the training

667
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,440
so what are your thoughts or some ideas

668
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,880
that you had around to make

669
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,880
training a bit more engaging a bit more

670
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,600
interesting to developers

671
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,120
um so i've i've done a couple of

672
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,960
workshops in the past with the team

673
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,720
and the the way i approached it the

674
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,240
first time was a flop

675
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,360
um and no one was really engaged so

676
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,840
i went and it was just a boring

677
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,279
presentation on

678
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,559
um sql injection and what you should do

679
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:21,039
xyz when building forms and

680
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,240
um securing endpoints and stuff um so i

681
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,520
went back to the drawing board and the

682
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,640
next time around

683
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,799
um in the team meeting and i said um

684
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,679
i basically showed him actively what's

685
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:34,640
happening so

686
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,480
i'd build a website that was vulnerable

687
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,039
and i'd just show him look this is what

688
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,240
it looks like and

689
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,919
from an attacker's point of view and

690
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,240
it it got them a lot more engaged but i

691
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,039
feel like it

692
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,480
actually taught them something which

693
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,559
they could actually take take back to

694
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,799
like they'd actually remember and go oh

695
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,000
maybe i should

696
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,679
um filter out apostrophe

697
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,120
it's it's um yeah it's

698
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,279
i feel like um

699
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,600
getting them engaged would just be

700
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,360
showing them how an attacker would

701
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,440
attack a website from my point of view

702
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,679
and maybe doing that over an extended

703
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,279
period of time so in

704
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,840
topics maybe you touch different topics

705
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,880
every

706
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,679
team meeting or however teams are run um

707
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,679
that's just my suggestion how

708
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:26,080
how i do it if i was running a team and

709
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,919
educating developers that

710
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,240
um security is a quality attribute of

711
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,279
software it's

712
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,080
equally as important as software passing

713
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,080
unit testing and integration testing

714
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,480
smoke testing etc etc

715
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,279
security is equally as important in the

716
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,799
quality of the output

717
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,120
because i would imagine and i i deal

718
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,559
with developers every day

719
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,200
um that a developer's not going to feel

720
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,640
too good about themselves

721
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,760
if their feature list is

722
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,559
ticked perfectly well and yet they've

723
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:57,039
got a

724
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,640
cross-out scripting vulnerability that

725
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,400
completely destroys

726
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,640
all the quality of that software so i

727
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,559
think that's how i package it is that

728
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:05,600
it's

729
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,520
it's in the front seat of the car or the

730
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,440
quality of the software

731
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,520
yeah that's why i've taken it and i

732
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,760
think it's also showing it demonstrating

733
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,559
it's not like

734
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,799
oh here's something hypothetically you

735
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,960
know this this may happen it's actually

736
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,320
seen in real life like

737
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,000
here it is actually happening and this

738
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,360
is like often how easy it

739
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,600
is i think it's also a really good way

740
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,399
of showing that

741
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,640
it's not like some wizardry going on and

742
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,720
you need this iq and that's and all this

743
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,679
kind of thing

744
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,720
um yeah i think that hulk's headed just

745
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,200
home

746
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,520
all that more so yeah yeah awesome

747
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,440
