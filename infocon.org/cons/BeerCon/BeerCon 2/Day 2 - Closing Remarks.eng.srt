1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,279
well

2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:06,480
we've now reached the end of the main

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,320
event of bearcon too and

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,800
um what a fabulous couple of days it's

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,679
been

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,759
really really enjoyable and a lot of the

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,920
feedback that we've had

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,400
has been along the lines of you wouldn't

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,960
have thought it was a rookie conference

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,119
because of the quality of the speakers

11
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:24,880
and i've got to say i agree with that

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,680
100

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,000
um it's a real testament to the quality

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,599
of the preparation

15
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,079
from the speakers themselves a testament

16
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,719
to the support that they've had from

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,559
the mentoring groups and the individual

18
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:37,840
mentors that they've gone out and

19
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,680
reached out to over the past

20
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,120
few weeks of preparation i've

21
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,920
been spectacular it really has and and

22
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,600
personally i'm incredibly proud

23
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,360
of the work that's gone into it by the

24
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,960
people who've put in the time

25
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,960
uh the speakers the mentors and so on

26
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,520
we're gonna do some um

27
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,440
some shout outs really i think that's

28
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,520
the best way to to proceed

29
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,480
um i want to just go through the

30
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,720
the stuff we went through start both

31
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,000

pulled pull out the bag and a lot of the

35
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,159
feedback i've received when

36
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,080
interacting with speakers has been just

37
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,680
about the mentors

38
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,799
the mentors yeah that their solid goal

39
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,320
and the contribution can never be

40
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,320
underestimated we can't thank you enough

41
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,439
for the pure involvement um special

42
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,400
props again to

43
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,400
to jared and lennox and you just heard

44
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,960
from leonard there who have the uh

45
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,720
unenviable task of closing the

46
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,159
conference which is

47
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,240
never the easiest thing to do but jared

48
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,079
and leonard did talks today as scott

49
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,399
mentioned in uh in the closing of lennox

50
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,240
talk and while also keeping things

51
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,040
moving

52
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,200
behind the scenes in the conference and

53
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,119
so that was magnificent the effort there

54
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,079
is brilliant

55
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,479
and again props to dave because dave as

56
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,079
well as being a mentor

57
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,759
he was also part and parcel of the of

58
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,520
the helping and moving people in the

59
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,280
right places and calming people's nerves

60
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,719
down again with jared and leonard

61
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,240
making people feel as comfortable as

62
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,080
they possibly could and if you remember

63
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,360
when we started talking about this

64
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,000
conference

65
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,280
the the aim amongst others was to make

66
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,120
it a safe and comfortable environment

67
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,280
for speakers and i i hope and i'd like

68
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,480
to think that with all the people

69
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,239
involved we managed to do that

70
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,920
and we'd look we'd really love your

71
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,840
feedback on how he felt

72
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,080
the organization of the conference the

73
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,879
way that it was

74
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,599
executed and all that kind of thing and

75
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,680
did we answer your nerves or did we help

76
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,280
remove some of your nerves i think

77
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:33,840
that's the

78
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,280
fundamental question that we'd probably

79
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,000
like to get get to the bottom of

80
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,760
um again the sponsors we'll get on

81
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,840
why we've got money this conference at

82
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,200
some point soon

83
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,360
but the idea is not to give it to

84
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,280
charity like we did in birkhon one but

85
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,040
the idea this time round is to reward

86
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,800
the people that participated

87
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,319
in it and we think that's really

88
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,720
important but to name the sponsors again

89
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,319
um travel hackers podcast thank you

90
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,120
quorum cyber pentest partners in cyber

91
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,000
uk

92
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,480
pwn defend octopi managed services and

93
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,760
exhibit

94
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,799
we thank you very much

95
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,400
enough this event i think but we're

96
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,360
going to make it a little bit more

97
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,480
special

98
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,040
by again giving something as a mentor

99
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,680
out to people that hopefully will um

100
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,680
keep it in their minds for as long as

101
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,680
they have a career in cyber security so

102
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,560
we hope um i'm now going to give a roll

103
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,560
call of the speakers

104
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,159
and i think that's really important that

105
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,840
they're the people that have made this

106
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,040
conference

107
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,720
we put it together and we've had the

108
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,239
support of people and all that kind of

109
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,120
thing

110
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,159
but at the end of the day it would have

111
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,760
been a pretty empty room for the past

112
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,040
two days if people haven't

113
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,920
stepped up and been brave enough and had

114
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,040
faith and confidence in themselves to

115
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,840
deliver the talks i think it's fair to

116
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,959
say that they gave an

117
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,480
absolutely tremendous account of

118
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,319
themselves throughout the two days

119
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,319
then again at the end of the the

120
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,439
conference

121
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,799
i'm not going to pick a favorite talk

122
00:03:58,799 --> 00:03:59,760
because i just think they were all

123
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,439
brilliant i really do

124
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,319
and here we go so we started yesterday

125
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,599
morning with zach slater

126
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,080
and then we had juan and then we had ben

127
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,840
and then we did our little

128
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,640
loose men panel thing talking about our

129
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,040
own

130
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,040
conference fails of which there are

131
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,238
we've had many and

132
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,440
we all will have many

133
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,440
continue you know there's no such thing

134
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,680
as a perfect conference

135
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,960
um then we had nikos we had nick we had

136
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,479
ray dan

137
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,600
marius elizabeth sean

138
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,120
on the mandolin at the end that was

139
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,120
special i think that's been clipped

140
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,960
by quite a few people from out of the

141
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,040
twitch we had vivian we had

142
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,880
shahrukh we have tech bits in um

143
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,800

chloe we had jennifer and

145
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,360
charlie that they gave it you know

146
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,280
three people doing one talk it can be

147
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,479
quite difficult but they

148
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,800
executed it magnificently so brilliant

149
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,000
where james bird's eye

150
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,560
with his uh reflections of life in the

151
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,320
nhs from the other side

152
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,800
of the story yeah not specifically to do

153
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,400
with i.t security

154
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,039
but how what we do in our little echo

155
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:07,919
chamber and bubble

156
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,919
actually directly impacts life out there

157
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,039
in the front line

158
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,639
we're mike fowler we have jared vicks

159

an absolute artifact that you've got the

163
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,080
talk but the actual material

164
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,759
that you presented was spot on there was

165
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,600
a lot of superb feedback

166
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,280
in the twitch around the quality of the

167
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,199
content so we'll make sure that you get

168
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,000

package that we can send through to you

194
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:27,840
opportunity

195
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,880
um for those who maybe

196
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,639
had the opportunity and then was taken

197
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,479
away due to

198
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,240
the current situations in uh 2020.

199
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,280

smile from ear to ear just seeing

202
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,600
the opportunity that was we could

203

this i'm a big believer and

223
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,599
even with one person less and one person

224
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,319
more one speaker less one speaker more

225
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,759
even just one different speaker it would

226
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,599
be an entirely different gig

227
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,160
um but every single speaker rocked up

228
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,800
they were all

229
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,199
nervous as hell every single one really

230
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,639
i'm not no can do it no

231
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,280
no i can't do it and every single person

232
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,199
smashed it out the park

233
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,240
um every single person delivered a talk

234
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,039
that i

235
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,440
i there was not one talk um and i don't

236
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,960
mind disclosing this

237
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,639
um there's a lot of conferences i go to

238
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,639
and i go that was a waste of time and

239
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,639
money i wish i'd stayed at home

240

yesterday even the loose men panel there

243
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,479
was something to be taken out of

244
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:17,360
everything

245
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,400
um that doesn't happen often and that's

246
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:20,720
not

247
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,120
us that's on you for applying it's on

248
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,039
the audience for interacting it's for

249
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,479
everybody in the slack it's for the

250
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:27,599
mentors

251
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,919
teasing uh and coaxing people into

252
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,599
actually talking or

253
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,760
breathing or i think one of the one of

254
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,919
their pieces of advice was um

255
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,479
do some push-ups before you do a talk i

256
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,640
i'd probably break like a twig if i

257
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,760

258
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,640

everybody turned up really

310
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,000
in my in my book but you think about

311
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,920
that number that's kind of football you

312
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,920
would expect at b-sides london

313
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,240
yeah they get between 1100 and maybe

314
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,839
1500 maximum

315
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,760
participants each year at a physical

316
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,279
conference

317
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,160
so to have that kind of number but

318
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,360
particularly when you're not going to

319
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,160
see people you

320
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,240
you're familiar with you know you're not

321
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,200
catching up with somebody because

322
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,160
they've got

323
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,760
a super reverse engineering talk that

324
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,839
you want to go and see

325
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,079

326
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,040

327
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,880
goose pump level goose bump level

328
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,320
pumping a goose is a different thing

329
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,120
inside honk um

330
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,399

331
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,640
that's again down to you the people that

332
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,480
gave up the time to get involved

333
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,120
um what else have we got to talk about

334
