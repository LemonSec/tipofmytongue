everyone it's my pleasure to introduce

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:09,840
nick who's going to demystify zero trust

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,360
and i'm super excited about this

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,599
presentation because i've seen

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,400
zero trust as a marketing dark

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,279
blockchain

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,359
ai driven machine learning solution

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,760
but nick is a technical guy so he's

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,560
going to get

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,519

chichen chang but it's very

30
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,280
uncomfortable so i'm gonna take that off

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,520
offensive security and threatening

46
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,560
telescope direction you're going towards

47
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,920
uh cool so before anyone

48
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,159
starts rolling their eyes and saying oh

49
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,840
great zero trust what now

50
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,920
um just a good little note on why i'm

51
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,960
doing the talk

52
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,159
uh three four weeks ago

53
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,000
prior to even signing up to the to beer

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,079
con i uh

55
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,600
i was like i've been seeing the word

56
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,520
zero trust being thrown around

57
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,959
on linkedin on twitter um and i just

58
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,399
started my blog

59
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,360
and so i thought what's you know i need

60
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,480
i need something to talk about i'm

61
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:14,959
always

62
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,400
at a loss for what to talk about on a

63
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,480
blog um so i thought you know screw it

64
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,120
up

65
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,640
i'll take zero trust see what comes up

66
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,360
and i thought this is a great

67
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,879
opportunity to kind of

68
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,680
um to research this to research

69
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,040
something to have an opinion on

70
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,840
something

71
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,080
uh so i did so this i'm gonna take this

72
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,239
into my first blog post later on as well

73
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,200
um and it's just i thought i'd take a

74
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,720
chance to clear the air

75
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,160
of zero trust i don't think i've really

76
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,680
seen much of that there's been some

77
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,599
talks at rsa

78
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,319
um but no one wants to sit through a 45

79
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,440
minute talk some guys

80
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,200
yammering on about it rather just a 20

81
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,040
minute talk

82
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,840
um

83
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,640
so what the heck is your trust uh

84
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,000
zero trust is a security model designed

85
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,400
by

86
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,879
john kinderback in 2010 he's an ex

87
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,879
ex-forester employee

88
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,920
and essentially zero trust focuses

89
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,360
around the verification

90
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,319
across the company's network effectively

91
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,159
removing all forms of trust within the

92
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,200
organization

93
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,840
that's where the quote never trust

94
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,080
always verify it comes from

95
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,760
it's often seen as a solution for

96
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,920
preventing insider threat

97
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,120
um it's been around for a while for

98
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,159
2010 like you said um so i was just

99
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,760
curious as to why it's been popping off

100
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,640
now

101
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,200
what what is what is zero returns why is

102
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,640
it happening now you know

103
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,360
um a lot of the while i was doing the

104
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,000
research

105
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,840
a lot of people compared it with the

106
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,000
castle moat example

107
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,120
uh the castle approach which is uh

108
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,200
essentially your organization protecting

109
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,400
itself from

110
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,439
external threats um which is great

111
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,280
but that lacks focus on internal threats

112
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,400
you know such as data expo or pai theft

113
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,760
um then it got me thinking why is there

114
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,760
no visual representation for zero trust

115
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,280
everyone's talked about castle and moats

116
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:05,680
and

117
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,400
it's easy to to describe that it needs

118
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:08,959
to like

119
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,400
visualize that so

120
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,840
i decided to take in my own hands and

121
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,238
propose my own example uh with the

122
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,600
visual representation of the work in

123
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,478
real time

124
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,880
i had to think of it as a bouncer

125
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,840
verifying you

126
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,240
your id before he or she lets you

127
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,440
stumble your drunken ass into the club

128
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,960
just kind of like that's it for but i

129
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,880
appreciate my custom gif

130
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,199
making

131
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,560
so how does it work while i was

132
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,720
researching this topic so many different

133
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,080
websites were saying

134
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,400
top ten principles top five principles

135
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,919
top three top 17 top 43 i'm like

136
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,560
i need something this is this diverted

137
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,800
me from what i'm trying to do

138
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,560
but from all these articles i read the

139
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,000
key takeaway were

140
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,360
these five areas of focus which is data

141
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,440
network people infrastructure and

142
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,720
operations and

143
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,199
the devices and organizations so firstly

144
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,840
these are

145
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,320
it's an obvious one it's a gold mine you

146
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,680
know that's what the hackers

147
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,560
criminals are looking for the most um

148
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,919
the

149
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,360
the focus for this is to essentially

150
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,360
protect it it's obvious one but it's

151
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,240
obvious it's often forgotten

152
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,320
it's important to understand where the

153
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,080
data stored in the company how

154
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,080
the confidential data is stored what is

155
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,280
the value of the data

156
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,039
on the network side of things um

157
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,560
it's another obvious one you know you

158
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,840
think of network networking security you

159
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,160
want to

160
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,360
network secure you can protect the

161
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,840
network but what's the purpose of that

162
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,880
you know you want to prevent

163
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,560
people from traversing the network when

164
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,320
they get in

165
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,639
if someone does get in stop them moving

166
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,240
lately across your network

167
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,000
so this could be taking an action of

168
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,600
disabling any services that aren't

169
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,280
needed on your

170
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,960
servers or your hosts or even

171
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,639
implementing methods like multi-factor

172
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,639
authentication which is

173
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,960
a necessity now like if you're not doing

174
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,840
it you're a loser

175
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,600
thirdly the people everyone knows the

176
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,880
humans are the weakest link in any

177
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,440
system

178
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,560
just read the art of human hacking

179
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,880
it's important as well to force policies

180
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,080
on how users can access

181
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,600
the system and how they have what they

182
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,680
have access to um

183
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,600
as well as monitoring the monitoring

184
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,120
their usage and behavior

185
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,479
not just uh online or logical but

186
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:31,759
physical networks too so

187
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,199
you know what's their um

188
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,720
the premise security what's physical

189
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,560
security do you have any biometric scans

190
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,680
things like that

191
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,080
um the infrastructure operations so

192
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,880
this took me a while to understand but i

193
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,680
think

194
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,080
i saw it in this perspective of you know

195
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,919
the entire tech stack of a company you

196
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,199
know that's what you should be looking

197
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,400
to secure

198
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,680
um how is the enter how are internal

199
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,520
apps customer facing apps how are they

200
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,360
designed how are they developed

201
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,520
is there a security built in or do they

202
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,120
just want to sit and put out fires after

203
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,599
it's been

204
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,280
pushed to production um

205
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,680
the devices is a common one

206
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,840
the attacker isn't on the outside the

207
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,759
attacker could be an employee they could

208
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,880
be a contractor they could be a

209
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,039
subcontractor

210
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,319
there's someone they could be given the

211
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,400
credentials to like

212
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,440
the devices are it's an obvious one

213
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,360
really i don't really get too much into

214
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,000
it

215
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,680
um so yeah it's it's a difficult one

216
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,280
because everyone's moving towards cloud

217
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:35,759
now

218
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,319
um moving towards other new technologies

219
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,160
isn't an easy job

220
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,479
there's no security pill to buy from the

221
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,160
southwest pharmacy they'll patch up your

222
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,080
crappy systems

223
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,800
zero trust is essentially it's a it's

224
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,639
it's a perspective companies should

225
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,160
adapt in a way to

226
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,080
stay resilient and stay growing

227
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,160
so i wanted to kind of go over the

228
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,120
example the techniques that uh

229
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,879
that you could implement that go along

230
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,879
with your trust there's plenty of

231
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,000
different ones out there

232
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,560
that are involved with your trust but i

233
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,080
thought i'd take a couple of them

234
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,440
um so first of all would be identity

235
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,039
identity verification and access

236
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,479
controls um

237
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,000
things like this could be biometric

238
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,319
scanners for physical security

239
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,759
or authorization tokens you know um a

240
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,280
good example of that could be

241
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,680
even using yubikey uh when you're

242
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,960
signing into your lastpass

243
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,559
or even just your internal app internal

244
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,000
login app or an internet or something

245
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,440
the third second one i found really

246
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,799
interesting was the principle of least

247
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,519
privilege

248
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,399
i've learned about it uni but seeing it

249
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,240
in practice especially at work

250
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,360
is interesting as well um this is

251
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,959
obviously restricting restricting the

252
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:51,920
permissions

253
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,399
and giving access to users that need it

254
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,040
that are

255
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,279
you know that necessary that's necessary

256
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,800
for certain users

257
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,720
so this ties in with designing the

258
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,080
internal application of security

259
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,800
built-in

260
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,040
who needs access to this is it the

261
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,120
entire company is it people in sales

262
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,720
do people in finance need this thing or

263
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,399
is it just the guys in dev

264
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,560
is it just an internal thing internal to

265
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,640
the team

266
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,640
thirdly and finally was micro

267
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,160
segmentation

268
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,200
this is uh example this could be

269
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,680
setting up dmz on the network breaking

270
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,080
down the workflow into smaller segments

271
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,760
with the necessary policies in place

272
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,080
so this leads me on to why

273
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,680
there's plenty of different models out

274
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,440
there why would you go with zero trust

275
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,959
it's not really

276
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,560
anything new in my my perspective um

277
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,200
you know a good example uh another good

278
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,680
example of this or uh

279
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,160
comparatively is the defense and depth

280
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,720
principle

281
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,800
but that's rather a framework and it's a

282
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,399
staple in the community in the security

283
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,279
industry

284
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,880
but i wouldn't say it's comparable

285
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,880
because it's

286
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,959
there's no technique to it there's it's

287
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,640
a it's a guide

288
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,040
zero trust is i don't know i feel it's

289
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,320
too new

290
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,680
um in my opinion it's it isn't a product

291
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,120
or a service it's

292
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,800
it's more of a conceptual value to a

293
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,040
system it's something companies should

294
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,839
work

295
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:18,640
towards

296
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,160
almost like implementing any other

297
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,760
security positive strategies

298
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,760
it needs to be worked in especially now

299
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,360
with the world with the way the world is

300
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,640
it's almost necessary to think about

301
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,160
implementing something like zero trust

302
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,600
you know with with the

303
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,000
remote working companies going full

304
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,800
remotes

305
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,160
during covert um it's

306
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,320
it's yeah it's it's a step in the right

307
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,760
direction in my opinion

308
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,360
everyone in their dad is moving towards

309
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,279
cloud so why not make it a lasting move

310
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,560
rather than a throwaway solution while i

311
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,760
was looking into this

312
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,800
um there's companies like crowdstrike

313
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,360
octa

314
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,399
akamai and cyberknight have actively

315
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,480
implemented it and by that i mean

316
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,920
they're talking about it they're saying

317
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,800
look we're

318
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,880
doing this we're moving towards this

319
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,240
this direction

320
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,839
but as well they're also the companies

321
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,440
that are trying to sell it so i'm like

322
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,160
a bit skeptical like do you want were

323
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,760
you trying to sell me this which is

324
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,600
i'm using the crowdstrike image as an

325
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,720
example here um

326
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,680
then yeah so that leads me to my final

327
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,320
slide

328
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,920
um to me zero trust is

329
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,839
it just seems like a bunch of security

330
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,360
strategies that already exist

331
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,519
wrapped up in a big pretty box with a

332
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,800
name that says zero trust

333
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,000
slapped on the side of it um perhaps

334
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,320
it's a good thing that's a buzzword

335
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,680
it brings to light the techniques and

336
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,519
strategies that organizations should be

337
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,480
putting in place

338
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,320
on the networks and systems and that

339
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,920
there's actually value in worrying about

340
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,279
your security strategy

341
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,279
and doing something about it early on

342
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,720
instead of having to fight fires when

343
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,680
the hackers take all these sweeties

344
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,200
perhaps companies should start treating

345
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,440
themselves and gift themselves

346
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,600
with a big pretty box with the word zero

347
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,800
trust luck on the side of it

348
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,760
and that's me any any questions

349
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,079
so i have a question um

350
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,760
oh sorry yeah and you want to take it

351
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,000
over no i don't know what your question

352
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,240
is

353
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,320
and somebody just tell me your questions

354
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,399
okay um

355
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,320
so google uh they have the beyond corp

356
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,279
um have you looked into that what are

357
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:25,600
your

358
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,959
thoughts on that if you have beyonco

359
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,519
i came across it uh while i was doing

360
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,959
like some people on reddit were talking

361
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,160
about beyondcorp i never

362
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,399
took the opportunity to look into it too

363
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,279
much

364
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,959
but i think it's it's a lot of people

365
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,880
are tying it with zero trust

366
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,920
like it's not a separate entity yeah it

367
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,680
just kind of goes back to working

368
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,639
with both frameworks yeah the the

369
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,399
concept of beyondcorp is you can work

370
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,360
from anywhere

371
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,760
of any device and it actively like

372
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,680
monitors the device like do you have the

373
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,880
latest updates yes

374
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,040
okay right right you don't i'm gonna

375
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,880
lower your level of access because

376
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,200
i don't trust you as much what are your

377
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,320
thoughts around that like

378
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,160
how do you see that helping businesses

379
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,680
like get to where we need to

380
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,760
i think it's like i mentioned before

381
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,720
especially

382
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,519
in a time like we're in now um loads

383
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,360
more companies that go and remote

384
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,320
so having that uh that sort of policy

385
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,399
that that system in place that monitors

386
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:23,120
your

387
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,240
devices um it's a good thing

388
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,240
especially when people are starting to

389
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,839
implement byod

390
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,000
you know how do you monitor such things

391
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
if you can't say a company can't afford

392
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,279
to give them

393
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,560
uh custom desktops or laptops

394
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,800
they have to use their own um how do you

395
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,079
manage the data coming in and out

396
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,800
i i sort of want to pivot off of that

397
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,160
question

398
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,560
so there's there's two areas that i want

399
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,959
to talk about the first is

400
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,800
i think zero trust or working in a zero

401
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,920
trust framework

402
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,199
should be as transparent to the user

403
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,720
as possible and and i would suggest

404
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,839
that if it's not it sets up for a very

405
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,399
adversarial relationship between

406
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,720
it security and the rest of the business

407
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,240
you have some ideas around that

408
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,240
yeah um i'm not i don't have any kind of

409
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,720
uh proposals around that but i will 100

410
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,240
agree with you there on the side of

411
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,480
transparency because

412
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,000
that i mean you nailed on the head if

413
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,519
there's a division between

414
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,320
i.t security and the rest of the company

415
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,279
not just

416
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,800
technically but there's going to be a

417
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,040
division in person in the personality

418
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,560
side of things the human side of it

419
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,839
how they're treated how the team's

420
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,760
treated which will ultimately affect the

421
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,319
workflow

422
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,279
transparency is key sort of a follow-on

423
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:45,920
to this

424
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,480
if somebody was looking at zero testing

425
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:48,959
their

426
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,160
small medium or even a larger enterprise

427
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,040
where do you feel they should start like

428
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,440
what

429
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,000
how would you move from like hey right

430
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,680
now we have a very typical business

431
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,240
network

432
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,279
it's a flat network um you know do you

433
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,360
start at the gateway do you start

434
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,240
um with uh active directory like where

435
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,760
would you go

436
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,480
my idea i'd in my head i'd start with

437
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,360
maybe

438
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,279
controlling uh user access and

439
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,920
so things like enabling single sign-on

440
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,399
on

441
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,760
applications they might use even if it's

442
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,079
not internal they use third-party apps

443
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,720
these third-party apps can do have

444
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,720
single sign-on integration

445
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,959
so it's a simple thing to implement so

446
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,880
why not

447
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,600
cool i have a pivot question off uh

448
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,320
single sign-on if you don't mind

449
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,279
so for a lot of businesses um single

450
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:41,920
sign-on

451
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,360
sounds like the absolute you know

452
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,519
these knees dogs bollocks this is gonna

453
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,800
solve all your problems

454
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,040
the problem is a lot of apps like slack

455
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,560
or other

456
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,800
big you know kind of enterprise level or

457
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,600
we can integrate with your environment

458
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,680
the costing for it is astronomical i

459
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,800
mean it's it

460
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,120
shouldn't be that difficult to link up

461
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,959
to an active directory

462
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,199
uh server or something like that i mean

463
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,160
what like

464
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,320
what what's the route then for small to

465
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,079
medium-sized businesses to be able to

466
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:12,560
still

467
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,920
get the same [ __ ] and still

468
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,839
follow basically your your guidance

469
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,680
that's that's a key point i've already

470
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,519
looked into that too much of

471
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,920
because i'm not too well versed in

472
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,600
single sign-on and the technology behind

473
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,160
it

474
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,880
i didn't know it costed that much or not

475
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,560
specific amounts but

476
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,880
um it's something worth looking into for

477
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,480
sure

478
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,800
yeah i just i just find it really it's

479
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,800
there's it's quite interesting that it

480
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,320
affects it can affect something like

481
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,240
that yeah i always

482
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,079
find that when you're working with

483
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,920
enterprise level businesses or public

484
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,519
sector where they've got the money or

485
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:50,720
they've got the resources they've

486
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,880
already got a relationship there

487
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,120
it's incredibly easy for them to

488
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,759
theoretically roll that stuff out

489
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,160
um the only question is obviously money

490
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,680
and implementation and actually getting

491
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,560
it through

492
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,039
regulators and all that other nonsense

493
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:05,679
the problem

494
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,000
doesn't come from those guys it usually

495
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,599
comes from the small to medium that are

496
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,599
just starting to kind of come into that

497
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,640
trying to follow a zero trust

498
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,319
framework policy whatever you want to

499
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,000
bill it as that can

500
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,919
be quite out there reaching that could

501
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,839
actually impact on

502
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,319
making it less transparent for the user

503
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,079
more of a bollock for them to actually

504
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,919
you know use the services use the tools

505
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:28,319
use

506
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,760
the third-party apps or whatever the

507
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,840
hell they're using more of a bollock and

508
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,600
then you add this zero truss layer on

509
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,200
top of it it becomes even more of

510
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,640
bollock and they end up

511
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,160
eating tech that's true actually

512
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,280
yeah it's a yeah it's a tough one i've

513
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,240
got a couple of

514
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,280
a question or a couple of points so

515
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,200
the the technology that sean was talking

516
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,480
about a few minutes ago

517
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,559
that google have adopted well microsoft

518
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:53,760
are doing the same thing

519
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,480
and that's it yes you know so you've got

520
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,120
in tune

521
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,600
and so if you're a 365 user there is

522
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,240
things like

523
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,200
device control um conditional access you

524
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,120
know we see it in in our team where i

525
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:05,520
work

526
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,000
where somebody will have logged in from

527
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,840
an ip address that microsoft thinks is

528
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,360
risky

529
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,080
and therefore there are rules in place

530
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:14,400
or

531
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,080
controls in place that maybe limit that

532
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,679
user's access and what they can actually

533
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,160
do

534
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,400
we then do a little bit of investigation

535
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,000
and find it that they're logged in by a

536
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,799
vpn

537
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,840
yeah and the ip address was

538
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,880
in the states yeah

539
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,160
so we are kind of implementing zero

540
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,120
trust

541
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,520
without calling it zero trust that's

542
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,760
exactly my point here that it's

543
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,600
people are already doing this companies

544
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,960
are already implementing these

545
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,400
techniques and strategies

546
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,720
but it's not framed in such a way it's

547
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,000
not saying oh look

548
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
there's zero trust i'm doing zero trust

549
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,360
yeah i think removing

550
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,480
the word trust from the discussion yeah

551
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,799
in in going back to ian's earlier point

552
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,559
about you know

553
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,320
creating division or avoiding creating

554
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,760
division then

555
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,640
maybe removing trust is a good idea

556
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,679
because

557
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,320
there's an implication that you don't

558
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,600
trust people right

559
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,320
the clue isn't yeah yeah exactly yeah

560
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,760
and if you're not trust them then they

561
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,200
don't trust you and no one trusts

562
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,640
anybody and you've got a

563
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,440
pretty potentially pretty unhealthy um

564
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,480
working environment

565
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,840
in which we're all actually trying to

566
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,679
get on the same team and pull in the

567
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:22,960
right direction so

568
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,480
those were just the the two points i

569
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,080
wanted to make yeah

570
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,080
no i agree with that it makes make sense

571
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,120
of like

572
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,080
logically speaking if there's if all you

573
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,200
have to do is verify it sort of

574
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,679
strengthens the process

575
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,039
there's nothing else to worry about you

576
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,880
don't have to worry about one person

577
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,880
talking over the other or speaking or

578
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,320
sorry handling the

579
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,160
data over the other yeah

580
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,360
absolutely we have had one question from

581
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,320
the audience saying

582
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,480
have you seen zero trust solutions from

583
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,240
providers such as sap

584
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,120
or oracle

585
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,159
not really i didn't i stumbled across

586
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,600
any um

587
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,720
there was i do know microsoft have their

588
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,039
own

589
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,840
xero trust team though um which was

590
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,360
quite intriguing like they have a

591
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,000
separate

592
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,159
unit of microsoft that's just focused on

593
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,360
zero trust

594
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,679
um but not with sap or oracle

595
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,760
i'm sure they would though i mean the

596
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,720
size of their companies

597
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,159
no worries um i'm sure if one wants to

598
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,240
expand on that question you can you guys

599
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,760
know each other you're in you're in this

600
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,039
light together i'm sure you can expand

601
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:33,679
upon it but

602
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,799
thanks for thanks for asking it um we

603
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,039
have had a kind of uh

604
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,200
off the cuff [ __ ] posty style question

605

top five favorite bands

606
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,080
top five favorite bands uh of the spot

607
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,760

tesseracts ac dc

609
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,919
and moon tooth oh great

610
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,070
i'm gonna say i voted one

611
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:05,659
[Laughter]

612
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,840
well listen thank you very much for that

613
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,559
nick nice thank you

614
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,360
so much i think it's uh the last the

615
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,600
takeaway i've got is that it's not a one

616
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,760
prong approach yep you've got to marry

617
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,039
up the technology

618
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,120
and get the business engaged with it

619
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,240
bring people with you

620
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,760
and by doing that then you can

621
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,600
collectively you know

622
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,240
exactly produce a good outcome yeah yeah

623
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,559
strong stuff man great job

624
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,880
thank you so much cheers nick thank you

625
