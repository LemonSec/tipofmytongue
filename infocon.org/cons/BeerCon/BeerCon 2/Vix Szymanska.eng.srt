over to you ricks welcome thank you uh

8
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,680
hi i am vixx and i'll be talking about

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,760
the lessons that i've learned during my

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,480
first year

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,359
in cyber security uh with a subtitle of

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,279
tales of an exhausted pigeon

13
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,679
so i really hope that everyone enjoys

14
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,920
bird metaphors and bird puns

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,920
because my talk is littered with them

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,360
to start off who am i well like i said

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,640
my name is vixx

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,879
i am the cyber security specialist at

19
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,879
the university of stirling

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,520
and i am also currently undertaking a

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,879
graduate apprenticeship

22
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,160
in a master's degree in cyber security

23
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,800
at the university of strathclyde

24
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,079
now i am in a very fortunate position

25
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,199
that i am the very first person in a

26
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,520
cyber security specific role within my

27
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,119
organization

28
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,360
before i joined the organization in this

29
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,320
position uh

30
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,439
the the responsibility for cyber

31
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,320
security

32
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,720
lied with many different parts of our

33
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,080
different teams

34
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,720
and they were jointly coming together in

35
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,600
order to

36
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,840
manage that i was brought into the

37
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,600
organization and given this opportunity

38
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,799
to develop myself

39
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,759
and my skills whilst in the role in

40
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,280
order to kind of

41
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,600
bring all of that effort together and be

42
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,119
the first person within

43
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,200
a cybersecurity specialist role at the

44
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,000
organization

45
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,439
so what do i do you might ask well

46
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,560
a little bit of everything i cover

47
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,880
everything from policy and process to

48
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,240
incident response

49
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,720
i create user awareness materials and

50
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,640
run information sessions

51
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,360
i have to comply with various frameworks

52
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,000
i do risk management data protection

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,280
i helped implement and run a team at our

54
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,600
university we do some vulnerability

55
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,680
management and i'm involved in business

56
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,360
continuity just to name

57
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,679
a few of the things that i am involved

58
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,680
in participate in or lead

59
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,800
on so that's all to say

60
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,000
that i found myself relating heavily

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,400
with

62
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,640
this post when i saw it pop up on

63
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,760
facebook once

64
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,200
i know that makes me sound like a bit of

65
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,840
a boomer but there we are

66
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,360
so i am not an early bird or a night owl

67
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,920
i am just a form of a permanently

68
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,720
exhausted

69
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,200
pigeon but through all of that

70
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,400
exhaustion over

71
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,440
my first year of cyber security i have

72
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,000
learned

73
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,879
quite a lot in terms of security and in

74
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:43,440
life

75
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,959
so i'd like to impart you with some

76
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,720
wisdom um

77
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,000
covering sort of three main areas

78
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,760
so i'll be looking at things that i've

79
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,800
learned about education and industry

80
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,200
building a career and the community

81
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,239
we'll be starting off with education and

82
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:02,959
industry

83
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,920
and before i dive into it i'd actually

84
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,360
like to note that this is

85
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,360
my third run um at doing a university

86
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,159
degree

87
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,200
i first started off with a bachelor's in

88
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,560
psychology

89
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,920
i then went on and worked in hotels for

90
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,599
a bit because it turns out that you

91
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,680
can't really do much with a degree in

92
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,200
psychology

93
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,560
i then decided uh that it wasn't for me

94
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,120
hospitality definitely wasn't my thing

95
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,000
but i loved

96
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,720
to know how people work and i also love

97
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,760
computers

98
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,280
so i decided to shift into it

99
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,560
i did a master's program in information

100
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,400
technology which was a conversion course

101
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,560
and lasted about one year

102
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,200
and then worked as an i.t support

103
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,239
specialist

104
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,519
on a service desk once i was

105
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,000
in i.t i realized that i'd like to join

106
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,680
those two things together

107
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,640
and do a bit of psychology and i t mash

108
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,760
it together

109
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,360
and decided on cyber security so

110
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,319
i applied for my role managed to land it

111
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,319
and i am now doing a master's program

112
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,560
while doing a full-time job

113
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,599
so the things that i've learned are

114
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,199
that a degree education and is

115
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,040
something that can only take you so far

116
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,639
really um

117
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,639
i know that a degree is often

118
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,280
necessitated by job requirements and it

119
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:27,520
is

120
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,280
increasingly important when you need to

121
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,919
move up the ladder in an organization

122
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,919
but what it really does is it gives you

123
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,680
the foundational knowledge that you

124
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,520
might need in order to succeed

125
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,160
you might learn the necessary writing

126
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,759
and research skills

127
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,520
that you might employ in your workplace

128
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,880
and it gives you a quantifiable way of

129
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,040
measuring your achievements

130
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,040
it also helps you get your foot in the

131
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,960
door where you might otherwise not have

132
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,120
an opportunity to

133
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,240
and ultimately that is all to say

134
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,560
that when you're learning on the job

135
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,639
you're applying that theory

136
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,720
and putting it into practice

137
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,560
one of the most important things that i

138
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,320
learned through doing both

139
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,639
university and working at the same time

140
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,320
is that although university is

141
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,680
absolutely great

142
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,800
at teaching you things the right way and

143
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,639
teaching you how to comply with certain

144
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,400
standards and teaching you

145
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,320
how to learn different tool sets or

146
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,280
perhaps apply

147
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,600
skills different things some of the

148
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,880
things that you can't learn in a

149
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,840
university setting is effective

150
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,520
communication a huge part of our jobs

151
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,919
is to be able to effectively communicate

152
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,919
risks upwards so that

153
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,120
our senior managers will invest in the

154
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,080
appropriate

155
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,320
tools and technologies that we need to

156
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,919
push the

157
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,560
organizations forward but we also need

158
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,400
to be able to speak to our users

159
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,800
and effectively communicate what they

160
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,400
need to do in order to secure our

161
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,400
systems

162
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,880
and what and what i've also learned

163
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,160
during my time at work

164
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,800
is that although university can teach

165
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,240
you how to use a variety of tools

166
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,000
learning on the job actually gives you

167
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,080
the power to use the right tools for

168
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,160
your environment

169
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,960
so it is absolutely great that when

170
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,440
people

171
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,639
picture a hacker or uh a person in cyber

172
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,479
security they think of

173
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,199
you know unix-based systems uh and you

174
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:29,919
know

175
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,160
all of the fancy things that come with

176
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,280
that um

177
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,199
you really need to be able to use the

178
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,199
tools that suit your environment within

179
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,400
your organization

180
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,520
so getting well equipped and well known

181
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:41,840
with

182
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,919
things like your windows operating

183
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,400
system and the things that lie within a

184
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,479
microsoft environment for example

185
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,560
are really important if you're going to

186
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,560
be communicating those risks to your

187
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,800
users

188
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,440
another thing that my job has allowed me

189
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:57,919
to do

190
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,960
is mentor and perhaps sometimes manage

191
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,759
others in a less formal capacity

192
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,360
so i had the opportunity to

193
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,080
mentor a student that was on the cyber

194
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,759
first placement scheme

195
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,680
and that helped me learn a lot about

196
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,800
myself my

197
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,280
sort of mentoring style as well as the

198
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,319
way that people

199
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,360
learn efficiently and that is not

200
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,800
something that i necessarily would have

201
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,080
gotten through a degree education

202
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,160
ultimately there is a lot of training

203
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,080
beyond a degree education as well

204
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,560
you know there are certifications there

205
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,000
are loads of other

206
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,479
things that you can learn online in just

207
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,199
uh

208
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,840
simple trading platforms through youtube

209
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,400
through a variety of other means

210
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,520
and it's really important to know that a

211
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,120
degree education

212
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,560
needs to be in tandem with all of these

213
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,400
other things in order for everything to

214
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,039
actually

215
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,039
click so that is to say that the main

216
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,319
things that i've learned

217
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,199
through through this process of learning

218
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,599
both on the job and through a degree

219
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,840
is that technical proficiency shouldn't

220
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,440
hold you back

221
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,240
i know that there is this sort of stigma

222
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:10,720
around

223
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,800
certain things like not being technical

224
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,639
enough for a role

225
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,440
but i have both surprised myself and

226
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,240
pleasantly

227
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,280
been surprised by other people um who

228
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,520
are able to

229
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,360
comply with certain standards or

230
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,560
employ best practice without necessarily

231
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,120
having the technical skill there

232
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,599
but i also know that from my degree

233
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:36,880
education i am

234
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,799
quite technical and i can be technical

235
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,240
when i need to be

236
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,399
it's just important to know when it's

237
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,000
when's the right time to use those

238
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,080
skills

239
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,920
another thing that i've learned is that

240
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,680
although university can teach you

241
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,680
specifically how to comply with certain

242
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,360
things

243
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,279
my job has taught me that compliance

244
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,279
doesn't always mean security

245
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,320
it's so important that our

246
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,080
people are at the core of what we do

247
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,600
and it's important to be able to

248
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,279
communicate effectively with them and

249
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,080
train them

250
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,800
and be able to understand how they're

251
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,680
using our systems and processes

252
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,880
because one simple failing of human

253
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,959
error can certainly bring down the

254
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,959
entire house

255
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,240
another thing i've learned is that

256
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,160
security is not optional

257
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,560
um i know that some people would like

258
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,839
for it to be

259
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,040
but sometimes we just really need to

260
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,880
effectively communicate the fact that it

261
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,160
just isn't and

262
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,360
we have to enforce certain things and

263
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,959
the greatest lesson that i've learned

264
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,120
out of all of this is not to try and fit

265
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,519
a square peg into a round hole

266
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,120
and that is to say that you really need

267
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,720
to know yourself and

268
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,040
know your learning style and know where

269
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,480
you want to pick certain things

270
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,839
up from because for example

271
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,000
i've learned that i don't particularly

272
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,920
like academia after doing my third

273
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,200
degree

274
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,160
and that other training and options are

275
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,000
much more suitable to me i'm a much more

276
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,720
practical learner and i know that i am

277
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,760
more effective

278
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,839
when i learn things practically on my

279
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,279
own so

280
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,360
i know that i need to be able to do

281
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,720
those things

282
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,600
in order to succeed in life

283
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,600
moving on then to the lessons i've

284
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,440
learned while trying to build a career

285
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,600
to reflect back on the sort of previous

286
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,720
topic

287
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,959
you really need to know what kind of

288
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,040
training opportunities are out there

289
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,240
and what suits your learning style so

290
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,200
i was very very fortunate in the fact

291
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,760
that

292
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,560
my job opportunity arose at the correct

293
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,760
time

294
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,839
but i knew that i needed this degree in

295
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,560
order to further myself and get a foot

296
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,240
in the door because i didn't have any

297
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,360
specific cyber

298
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,000
security experience before but if you

299
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,680
are starting from scratch

300
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,440
it's important to know that that's not

301
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,720
the only route

302
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,399
there are other ways of getting into the

303
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,880
industry and just because

304
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,880
a bunch of people around you might have

305
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,640
a degree it doesn't necessarily mean

306
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,079
that you need one

307
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,480
and you can gain those skills elsewhere

308
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,240
another important thing to remember is

309
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,880
that everyone brings a unique and

310
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,720
unique point of view and that is really

311
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,240
important

312
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,399
my background is quite mixed you know i

313
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,279
came from

314
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,160
a sort of customer service hospitality

315
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,240
psychology background

316
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,680
i then swung into i.t and i brought that

317
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,640
side of things to what i do at work

318
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,680
today

319
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,720
and all of those sorts of things are

320
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,160
important and bringing a balanced

321
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,120
view and approach to your work it is not

322
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,680
only

323
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,079
the harsh technical skills that are

324
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,480
needed but soft skills as well as i know

325
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,360
that sean has said before

326
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,440
and i just really think that that's an

327
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,959
important thing because a lot of people

328
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,120
can feel a bit downtrodden about perhaps

329
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,480
not being from the right background

330
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,720
another important thing is to gather

331
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,639
evidence of your work

332
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,079
and this is something that i want to

333
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,839
work on um

334
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,320
but just as important as getting

335
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,920
experience in the field is

336
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,079
actually evidencing that experience and

337
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,240
what you're doing in your free time or

338
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,160
perhaps just in your training is really

339
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,839
important so

340
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,880
perhaps starting a blog and putting that

341
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,680
out there

342
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,279
giving talks at conferences um you know

343
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,120
publicizing yourself on linkedin and

344
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,560
what you're doing

345
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,959
and it can certainly help give you the

346
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,480
reach that you need and

347
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,240
it always feels good to have something

348
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,000
to reflect on and to see what you've

349
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,200
done in the past

350
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,639
and how that has helped you grow

351
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,320
one of the most important things for me

352
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,880
was being able to seize the moment

353
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,760
and like i've said before i was very

354
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,880
fortunate that my

355
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,279
job opportunity arised at the same at

356
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,000
the correct

357
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,440
time but there are a number of things in

358
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,600
my life that i've done that i feel like

359
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,320
i have taken the correct opportunity at

360
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,680
the correct time

361
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,279
and it's important to be aware of the

362
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,279
opportunities that are around you when

363
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,560
it comes to building a career

364
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,160
and of course you need to engage with

365
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,920
others in the industry

366
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,200
you cannot succeed in solitary

367
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,160
confinement

368
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,800
so to speak you need to be able to speak

369
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,920
to others

370
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,560
get to know people make sure that you

371
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:34,800
are learning from other people as well

372
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,720
lastly i'd like to talk a little bit

373
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,839
about community

374
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,720
the most important thing to take away

375
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,079
here is that you need to get yourself on

376
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,360
the bird app

377
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,079
which is of course twitter but community

378
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,040
is honestly

379
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,959
the best resource that there is out

380
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,240
there in terms of

381
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,800
actually furthering your career getting

382
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,120
lots of training materials

383
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,880
and getting to know people in the

384
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,240
industry

385
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,639
there are lots of different platforms

386
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:03,360
where people

387
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,639
join to communicate such as twitter and

388
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,680
uh discord and slack and it's important

389
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,959
to join those communities so that you

390
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,440
can speak to other like-minded people

391
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,680
one of the best things that i've learned

392
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,519
during this process is that everyone

393
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,480
is an imposter or feels like one and it

394
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,000
was so nice to hear

395
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,320
that and be able to know that it's not

396
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,639
just me that feels this way

397
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,320
i think it's easy to think that because

398
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,720
you've only had so much experience

399
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,040
in a certain industry that you might not

400
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,800
have something important to say

401
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,880
but i think everyone feels that way to a

402
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,600
certain degree

403
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,519
of course there's lots of mentorship and

404
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,279
training opportunities and everyone is

405
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,560
really inclusive and

406
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,199
welcome and there are safe and inclusive

407
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,320
spaces for all

408
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,639
so uh there are a lot of groups that are

409
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,560
dedicated specifically to minority

410
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,560
groups for example where you can have a

411
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:54,959
safe

412
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,959
and comfortable space to speak to each

413
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,320
other and learn from each other

414
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,279
of course one of the important things

415
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:03,600
are

416
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,959
conferences ctfs and hackathons so

417
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,720
conferences like the ones thrown today

418
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,560
really show the importance of community

419
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,680
and the very positive side of community

420
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,720
where we can help each other magnify

421
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,680
each other

422
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,480
amplify each other and really help each

423
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,880
other along

424
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,800
one of the coolest things i never

425
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,240
thought would happen to me

426
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,320
at all within the first year of uh

427
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,480
dipping my toe into this

428
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,519
is uh being quoted by forbes

429
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,560
and so just by seizing the opportunity

430
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,160
of speaking to the right people on

431
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,360
twitter

432
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,399
i managed to actually be quoted in

433
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,800
an article on forbes about k-pop and

434
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,920
cyber threats

435
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,759
and i know it's a bit of a risky move to

436
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,839
out myself as a k-pop stand but

437
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,279
here i am and i really never thought

438
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,360
that those two things would overlap

439
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,399
but as one of my friends so kindly said

440
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:58,800
uh

441
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,040
there's a venn diagram for everyone

442
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,279
so in conclusion um i'd just like to

443
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,000
leave you with

444
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,480
the five main lessons that i've learned

445
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,100
through bird metaphors

446
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,399
[Laughter]

447
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,040
first one is get out there and test your

448
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,920
wings

449
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,839
so education and academia can only take

450
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,600
you so far but you really need to

451
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,040
practice your skills

452
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,360
and put yourself out there and that

453
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,279
doesn't necessarily mean that you need a

454
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,880
job in order to be able to do these

455
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,560
things there are a lot of things that

456
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,720
you can do in your own time and blog

457
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,639
about online or

458
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,399
a lot of things that you can experience

459
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,240
without necessarily having to be

460
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,440
in a job and it's important that you

461
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,560
move past

462
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,880
just the theory and putting it into

463
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,360
practice

464
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,320
don't chicken out especially don't

465
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,519
chicken out of things

466
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,600
uh because you feel that you might not

467
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,279
be technical enough

468
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,759
it's important to know that everyone has

469
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,279
very important skills

470
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,400
and you need to be able to get past that

471
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,319
in order to thrive in the community

472
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,559
the early bird gets the worm but the

473
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,400
second mouse gets the cheese

474
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,199
uh this is to say that you need to seize

475
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,959
the opportunities that you're given

476
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,880
at the right time and do not wait for

477
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,839
things to happen

478
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,439
to you had i not signed up for this

479
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,359
wonderful conference for example

480
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,360
i would not be speaking to everyone and

481
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,320
getting some experience and talking

482
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,400
had i not gotten on twitter and engaged

483
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,919
with the community i wouldn't have even

484
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,919
known that beer con exists

485
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,160
so it's really important that you seize

486
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,919
the opportunity at the right time

487
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,160
don't count your chickens before they've

488
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,840
hatched

489
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,880
this is to say that compliance does not

490
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,120
necessarily mean security

491
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,000
and and you cannot be assured that you

492
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,760
will be secure because you comply with a

493
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,200
certain framework

494
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,160
you really need to focus on all three

495
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,039
things which are

496
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,160
people processes and technology and make

497
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,840
sure that you're giving a good

498
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,520
amount of attention to your people

499
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,679
especially

500
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,039
and lastly birds of a feather flock

501
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,160
together

502
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,960
so that is just to reinforce this idea

503
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,960
of community and how important it

504
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,320
is and that you really need to

505
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,240
engage with the community if you want to

506
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,480
have a really fulfilling career

507
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,520
in infosec

508
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,440
so that's me one of the things that i'm

509
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,720
going to try and do

510
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,320
is learn from my lessons and actually

511
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,280
start a blog

512
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,160

516
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,360
you can follow me on twitter at cybersec

517

v and i'll be

518
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,280

519
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,000
really just

520
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,320
like to thank the beer farmers and our

521
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,080
lovely mentors and everyone else

522
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,280
involved in running this

523
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,760
amazing event thank you very much vixx

524
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,600
really really kind of share those words

525
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,760
at the end

526
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,480
brilliant talk really really cool and i

527
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,440
can't thank you enough

528
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,919
we have got a few questions which i'm

529
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,200
just trying to

530
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,480
get my hands on right now

531
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,000
bear with me one sec all right

532
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,919
so these are coming from the last slide

533
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,520
again fixed so that people can

534
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,640
uh perfect laurie

535
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,600
all right so yeah a couple of questions

536
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,400
that were coming from the

537
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,880
from the twitch and and actually one of

538
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,000
them was going to be when i was going to

539
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,840
ask you anyway

540
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,080
on your first line you you kind of who

541
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,919
am i slide

542
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,039
you listed a bunch of stuff a huge bunch

543
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,240
of stuff

544
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,320
and it indicated to me this idea that i

545
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,679
think a lot of us have been there that

546
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,000
you're

547
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,640
a bit of a jack of all trades oh yeah

548
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,280
you know

549
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,039
you know the the whole idea that you can

550
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,039
dabble in a lot of different things

551
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,640
so i guess the question which which came

552
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,320
from nicos was

553
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,840
how do you handle being a single point

554
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,760
of decision

555
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,760
and then potentially a single point of

556
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,640
failure if an incident occurs

557
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,679
yes so um i suppose the important thing

558
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,080
there

559
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,120
is that i have line management who are

560
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,440
hugely supportive and that is a huge

561
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,640
help because

562
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,640
although i hold a lot of responsibility

563
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,799
within my organization

564
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,200
i can still defer to people above me in

565
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:27,840
order to

566
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,960
sort of cushion me should i fall

567
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,960
so it's really important to have a good

568
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,720
relationship with senior management and

569
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,480
have their backing and support

570
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,679
and in order to know that any decision

571
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:40,880
that you make

572
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,120
is supported and is correct and possibly

573
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,720
has another way of going i guess uh

574
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,559
so to say um and in terms of

575
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,200
uh being a single point of failure i i

576
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,000
try to

577
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,720
mitigate that by bringing all of the

578
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,440
people from our disparate teams together

579
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,919
um i actually run a sort of weekly

580
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,520
meeting where i just grab

581
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,440
everyone involved in any of my security

582
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,720
projects together

583
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,960
we talk about what we're working on and

584
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,840
we've built up a little team

585
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,320
and it's important that everyone has the

586
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,919
right responsibilities

587
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,120
and the right uh mindset

588
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,480
in order to help work together and that

589
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,080
kind of mitigates the effect of being a

590
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,600
single point of failure because everyone

591
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,200
knows what they're responsible for

592
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,960
people have someone to turn to in all

593
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,240
sorts of um

594
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,559
events so it's it's really helpful and

595
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:35,919
positive that way

596
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,240
yeah brilliant great answer thank you um

597
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,919
another question from tia which is a

598
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:40,960
really cool question

599
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,840
i think do you have any tips or advice

600
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,720
around

601
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,760
communication with diverse audiences

602
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,000
such as those at a university um

603
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,760
particularly when in industry

604
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,520
there are a lot of common goals and

605
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,600
objectives but maybe not so much

606
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,880
in the university or academic

607
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,240
environment yeah we're definitely an odd

608
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,760
bunch

609
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:06,240
um i i think that especially the source

610
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,039
technical skill levels can vary so much

611
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:09,760
you know

612
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,080
i've had to speak to infrastructure

613
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,679
specialists all the way down to

614
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,600
students just joining the university who

615
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,480
don't really know how to work an iphone

616
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,159
and it's really important to be able to

617
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,520
tailor that

618
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,520
communication style to the appropriate

619
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,679
audience

620
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,720
what i find useful is looking through my

621
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,480
notes when i was kind of beginning my

622
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,120
journey and

623
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,280
kind of starting to understand i t in

624
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,240
general

625
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,400
and then cyber security because i can

626
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,320
put myself back in that mindset of when

627
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,000
i first learned those things i can

628
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,559
i find myself being able to explain

629
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,480
those things in simpler terms to people

630
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,039
so yeah it's just about approaching it

631
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:49,520
from

632
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,440
a beginner's point of view in certain

633
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,880
cases um

634
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,960
and at other times just putting on your

635
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,320
more technical hat and

636
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,440
speaking to people in that way yeah

637
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,120
and i guess not assuming that everybody

638
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,240
knows the same stuff you know right

639
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,400
that's really really important yeah

640
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,840
absolutely i think um

641
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,320
we have a tendency sometimes to speak in

642
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,520
a lot of jargon

643
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,280
um and you know trying to

644
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,880
flabbergast people with technical

645
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,039
terminology and it's something that i

646
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,039
always try to dial back as much as

647
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,080
possible

648
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,559
and just speak in as simple terms as

649
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,200
possible just to get the message across

650
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,320
yeah perfect okay well vex

651
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,000

652
