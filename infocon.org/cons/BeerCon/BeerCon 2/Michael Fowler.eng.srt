welcome back

2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,720
um up next we have michael fowler um

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,160
he's going to give us a talk on

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,080
communicate better by knowing yourself a

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:12,799
little bit more

6
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,519
i'm looking forward to this um take it

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,600
away mike

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,080
scott um thanks for having me so first

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,359
of all before i start i want to just say

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,039
thanks to all the beer farmers

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,439
all the sponsors the mentors the coaches

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:26,960
for helping set this up

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,359
um and in particular thanks to three

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,439
people donna graham and ewan

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,040
who kind of helped me with with my

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,800
slides and gave me feedback

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,719
on what you're going to see here today

18
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,640
so hopefully it'll be good

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,960
a little bit about myself mike fowler

20
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,840
it's who i am

21
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,920
i'm currently security operations lead a

22
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,879
company called

23
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,120
insights learning and development um

24
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,039
joined there in may of this year so it

25
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,320
was good to change jobs

26
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,600
mid pandemic and i've been working

27
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,879
as as a blue team security operations

28
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,840
security engineer since about 2003

29
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,879
um starting in in the royal navy

30
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,920
um although i've worked in infosec for

31
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,119
such a long time

32
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,280
i've never actually given a talk so this

33
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,240
is

34
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,040
a first for me and uh and appreciate the

35
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,960
opportunity

36
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,799
so i'm going to talk about communication

37
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,159
today um

38
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,479
it's my feeling that communication is

39
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:21,360
probably

40
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,840
the critical soft skill that anyone

41
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,880
should have

42
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,360
um you could be the world's best hacker

43
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,799
you can hack a microwave with a

44
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,079
calculator

45
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,960
but if you can't communicate how you did

46
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,360
it

47
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,680
what the risk is what the options are to

48
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,799
protect yourself against

49
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,520
it then all the technical skill in the

50
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,040
world isn't really going to

51
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,680
kind of do you and and it's a hill i'm

52
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,799
prepared to die on

53
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,479
and i know i'm not going to be alone

54
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,079
because we've got directors from

55
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,320
deloitte saying similar things

56
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,439
um beer farmers saying similar thing

57
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,360
basically all around the world even

58
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,280
vice president of microsoft's 365

59
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,920
work modern working right the way

60
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,560
through

61
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,479
all saying the same things that

62
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:07,600
communication

63
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,038
and general soft skills are

64
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,599
at least as important as technical if

65
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,400
not um

66
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,440
kind of more so

67
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,920
as i said before i joined uh insights

68
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,640
back in

69
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,520
may this year and as with any new staff

70
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,440
member when you join any company they do

71
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,920
sort of an onboarding process and it was

72
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,720
um going

73
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,959
through their onboarding process of a

74
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,640
workshop over a few days

75
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,840
that they covered an element of

76
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,560
communication knows that for

77
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,400
communication has always been important

78
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,920
i've seen other talks about

79
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,879
communication but they've tended to

80
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,120
focus a little bit more on the what to

81
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,720
say so talking

82
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,920
non-technical language talking uh

83
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,720
business

84
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,280
risk financial risk but going through

85
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,160
this um

86
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,720
the insights on boarding process it kind

87
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,720
of had a light bulb moment for me

88
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,480
because the insights process talks a bit

89
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,159
more about how

90
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,640
to communicate with um other people

91
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,599
which i found

92
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,200
was kind of missing in a lot of the

93
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,879
other communication talks i've i've

94
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,519
heard

95
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,920
um previously so one would do is just

96
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,280
take those um

97
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,360
high-level sort of insights and share

98
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,800
them with you to hopefully

99
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,440
help you communicate better going

100
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,040
forwards

101
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,720
so to do that you need to understand a

102
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,440
little bit about insights has a view

103
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,640
of these four color energies

104
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,000
in cool blue fiery red earth green

105
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,879
and sunshine yellow um cool blue

106
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:35,519
energies

107
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,720
is typically sort of analytical

108
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,040
cool blue asks a lot of questions they

109
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,720
like to understand the detail like to

110
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,239
understand the bigger picture

111
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,319
and they're very very logical they like

112
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,360
to do things a b

113
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,959
c d e f um in in order

114
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,519
fiery red on the other hand um they're

115
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,840
kind of very driven and motivated

116
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,920
if you give them a task to do give fire

117
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,519
red energy a task to do they'll go and

118
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:00,480
get it done

119
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,159
they don't really care too much about

120
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,000
the detail they just want to know

121
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,159
what do i need to do when do i need to

122
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,159
do it by and they'll go off and and do

123
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,159
it

124
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,319
earth green energy is is a little bit

125
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,200
more concerned

126
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,160
about the people side of things so how

127
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,358
does it affect the team

128
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,759
how does it affect the staff um they're

129
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,400
very supportive and encouraging

130
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,560
um and and generally i say that they're

131
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,000
very much a

132
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,120
team player is is earth green energy and

133
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,040
then lastly sunshine yellow

134
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,240
these are the bubbly enthusiastic

135
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,600
um sort of types um they're also very

136
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,440
very good for creative thinker they can

137
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,199
come up thinking of lots of different

138
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,400
ideas lots of different

139
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,600
um opportunities um they're very

140
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,360
dynamic they can flip from one thing to

141
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,520
another and generally they typically

142
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,720
sort of inspire

143
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,840
um other people around you that's a high

144
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,840
level what sunshine yellow energy is all

145
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,040
about

146
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,880
now one thing to sort of call out is

147
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,759
that the idea the insights say is that

148
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,199
you're a mix of all these

149
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,440
four color energies so while you might

150
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,720
naturally

151
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,080
um find yourself leading with say cool

152
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,639
blue you're made up of all four color

153
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,080
energies and you can

154
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,800
um dial up the other color energies it

155
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,160
just might take a little bit more of a

156
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,320
conscious effort to dial up maybe

157
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,479
in my case sunshine yellow energy a

158
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,080
little bit

159
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,880
so one or two to now is going through

160
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,479
hopefully everyone should recognize this

161
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:28,800
this

162
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,160
is the incident life cycle

163
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,360
taken from nist 800 and it generally

164
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,240
it covers the high level the the stages

165
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,919
of an incident from preparation

166
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,000
detection and analysis containment

167
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,600
eradication recovery and

168
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,759
post instant activity and what i want to

169
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,440
go through is in each of these blocks

170
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,759
just kind of call out how you might

171
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,600
expect to see

172
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,240
certain color energies functioning so if

173
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,240
we go into preparation

174
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,000
sunshine yellow as i said before

175
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,440
sunshine yellow energies

176
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,319
are very creative thinkers so they can

177
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,080
think outside the box they can think of

178
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,520
all the different ways

179
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,360
that a system or an organization

180
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,000
potentially could get attacked

181
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,919
whereas you might think a website you

182
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,520
click a b and c

183
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,800
they might think well actually what

184
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,160
happens if an attacker just goes

185
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,400
straight to c

186
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,120
you also have fiery red energy in the

187
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,880
preparation phase if you get threat

188
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,479
intelligence if you get

189
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,639
um information that you've got zero log

190
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,199
on vulnerabilities or other

191
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,280
critical quantities like that you need

192
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,440
fiery red energy to take that

193
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,120
run with it and actually get something

194
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,600
done about it whether supply a patch

195
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,639
put in a follow rule or do something to

196
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,880
to mitigate whatever the um imminent

197
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,880
risk is

198
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,400
if we then go into sort of detection and

199
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,720
analysis you're going to need

200
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,880
earth green energy and this is because

201
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,479
as you're analyzing an incident you've

202
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,240
detected something you're analyzing it

203
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,520
you're going to have to go and speak to

204
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,840
people and with earth green energy being

205
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,759
the warm sort of compassionate type of

206
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:00,800
energy

207
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,560
you're more likely to get people to open

208
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,319
up to you and actually say yeah i

209
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,199
clicked on that phishing email or yeah i

210
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,720
went and done this bad thing

211
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,240
whereas if you try and just go in with a

212
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,840
big stick they're gonna

213
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,840
climb up and you're not gonna get any

214
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,160
information

215
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,520
um sort of energy and very very useful

216
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,560
in this stage

217
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,880
and then cool blue energy the analytical

218
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,199
side logical side you've got analysis

219
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,840
you need to go from a to z and

220
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,039
understand

221
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,199
what actually happened what's what's

222
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,800
going on what's what's

223
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,240
um what's the risk to the company

224
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,520
then you can move on to containment

225
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,440
eradication and recovery

226
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,599
and again firing red energy if you've

227
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:42,560
got

228
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,240
say ransomware running through your

229
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,319
organization it's worming its way all

230
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,199
the way around

231
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,639
you're going to need to take decisive

232
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,240
action to to stop it

233
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,919
you don't need to understand the full

234
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,599
aspect of what's going on

235
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,479
fiery red energy just gets the job done

236
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,319
and again earth green energy

237
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,560
you're going to need to be working with

238
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,080
people people are going to be scared

239
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,360
that they're going to lose data they

240
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,199
might lose their jobs

241
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,360
this warmth and compassion that comes

242
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,360
particularly from earth green energy

243
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,520
will help engage that and also means

244
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,960
next time round

245
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,400
because you've been that warm

246
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,000
compassionate um

247
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,599
type of energy they're more likely to

248
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,199
come and tell you oh i think i might

249
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,759
have done something silly in the future

250
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,240
and then lastly in post-instant activity

251
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,440
again cool blue

252
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,759
so you can take that logical analysis of

253
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:28,560
the incident

254
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,319
what happened why did it happen how can

255
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,479
we stop it happening again

256
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,958
but also sunshine yellow energy to kind

257
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,799
of think outside the box okay this is

258
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,958
how it's designed to work

259
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,360
what if we didn't do something that was

260
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,719
designed to do how would that

261
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,360
work what could we then do to protect or

262
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,240
detect

263
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,600
um that sort of a an attack so that's

264
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,760
kind of just a very quick overview of

265
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,760
how you might see these different color

266
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,560
energies um happening in a security

267
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,279
operations

268
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,200
kind of environment also hopefully we'll

269
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,880
show you that one person could have all

270
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,560
the well one person will have all these

271
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,760
color energies

272
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,360
and depending on what they're doing they

273
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,360
can dial up or dial down

274
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,680
the different energies to to suit

275
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,320
whatever they they kind of need

276
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,920
so now you know the different color

277
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,000
energies what sort of

278
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,720
what color energies is um associated

279
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,600
with what kind of

280
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,160
um elements i've been cool blue and

281
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,600
logical

282
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,839
now we come on to how do you communicate

283
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,519
with those color energies

284
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,920
so if you go to um communicate with a

285
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,800
cool blue

286
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,920
some things to to keep in mind are

287
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,160
look at different approaches step out of

288
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,000
your comfort zone cool blue

289
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,959
they might come up with different ideas

290
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,480
be willing to think about them be

291
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,279
willing to go

292
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,959
actually i didn't think of that and

293
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,519
don't go thinking my idea is the only

294
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,839
idea and it's the best idea since sliced

295
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,000
bread

296
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,920
good blue energies they love to

297
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,680
understand what's going on so they will

298
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,080
ask

299
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,000
a lot of questions and they will offer

300
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,200
alternatives

301
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,360
if you're not prepared to receive those

302
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,880
questions and alternatives

303
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,320
doesn't necessarily mean you need to

304
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,160
have the answers but if you're not

305
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,480
ready to receive those questions cool

306
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,160
blue energy is

307
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,519
basically going to climb up and you're

308
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,600
not going to have um a decent

309
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,560
engagement with with cool blue energy

310
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,120
focus

311
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,680
on your logical analysis and give a lot

312
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,120
of background information

313
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,519
comes back to cool blue energy they like

314
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,360
to understand the bigger picture even if

315
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,120
they're only involved in a small part

316
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,959
they want to know the bigger picture and

317
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,160
they want to go in a logical fashion abc

318
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,399
they don't want to be jumping around um

319
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,839
because it's just not how cool

320
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,440
cool blue energy so it works and lastly

321
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,240
be thorough and be structured in your um

322
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,360
explanations

323
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,760
give cool blue energy the plan the

324
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,399
bigger plan and where they fit into it

325
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,079
with these kind of just for high level

326
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,600
bits hopefully

327
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,600
communicating with cool blue energy will

328
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,519
be a lot more beneficial and you'll

329
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,279
get more of the results that you're

330
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,519
you're hoping for

331
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,040
moving on to fiery red energy fiery red

332
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:03,760
energy

333
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,399
they they are direct their uh the fire

334
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,720
legend red energy is a direct energy

335
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,079
so when you're communicating with

336
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,480
thyroid talk openly and be assertive

337
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,000
about what you think

338
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,720
if you disagree with fiery red energy be

339
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,560
vocal about it obviously be professional

340
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,480
but be vocal about disagreeing with

341
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,560
fiery red you'll get a lot more respect

342
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,120
from fiery red energy that way

343
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,200
agree to share control and

344
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,480
responsibility

345
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,959
because fiery red energy is used to

346
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,079
doing things

347
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,320
um and getting things done they like to

348
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,839
be in control they like to have the

349
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,040
responsibility

350
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,760
so if you can share that control share

351
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,519
that responsibility and you'll find you

352
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,200
get a lot further

353
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,200
with a firing red energy be direct

354
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,440
and assured with what you're saying and

355
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,240
bear in mind

356
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,240
fiery red going back to their their um

357
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,320
assertive and direct nature they may

358
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,760
forget to ask you for input

359
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,760
so if they do just pipe up and say

360
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,440
here's my opinion here's here's my

361
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,399
thoughts

362
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,519
fiery red energy will appreciate that

363
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,120
and lastly if if you can

364
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,360
give fiery red energy independence if

365
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,200
you give them a task to do

366
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,279
let them go away do the task and then

367
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,639
come back don't be

368
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,240
peering over their shoulder every two

369
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,079
seconds because that

370
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,480
just annoys fire red energy they like to

371
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,200
be independent

372
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,040
like to go away achieve a goal and then

373
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,000
come back and tell you

374
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,480
earth green energy i said before is more

375
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,480
of a people energy

376
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,480
when you're giving your reasoned an

377
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,680
analytical approach

378
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,720
remember to balance it with um warmth

379
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,639
and concern and compassion

380
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,720
it's okay telling them a b and c is

381
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,680
going to happen

382
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,920
but also explain how does that affect

383
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,360
the team how does it affect

384
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,279
people that are involved they'll get you

385
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,120
a lot further with green energy than

386
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,160
than otherwise don't expect an

387
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,519
immediate response from green energy

388
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,600
let them have time for reflection and

389
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,519
consideration to go away think about

390
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,880
what you're asking about them

391
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,560
think about what the plan is and then

392
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,920
come back to you whether that's five

393
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,360
minutes or five days

394
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,000
but just give them um that time to to

395
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,880
allow them to reflect

396
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,240
with being um sort of a more people

397
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,240
type of energy earth green energy will

398
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,360
quite often

399
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,880
forget about their own needs although

400
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,519
put their own needs second to the team

401
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,240
be upfront about what you need and what

402
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,200
your needs are

403
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,680
and also encourage them to share theirs

404
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,320
because

405
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,399
their needs and your needs might be just

406
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,320
as valid and just as important as

407
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,320
the rest of the team don't let them be

408
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,399
neglected

409
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,040
and lastly don't hide away problems

410
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,920
discuss

411
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,920
any potential problems openly and

412
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,440
honestly but

413
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,199
big thing to remember is do it in a

414
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,279
caring and compassionate way

415
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,519
these these kind of tips will get you

416
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,480
miles

417
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,199
um of engagement with with earth green

418
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,120
energy

419
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,880
and then sunshine yellow sunshine yellow

420
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,120
has

421
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,519
said is they're very um sort of

422
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,240
excitable they're very sort of bubbly

423
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,000
when they're communicating with you when

424
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,519
they're interacting with you

425
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,760
you need to respond to their style if

426
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,760
you're sitting there with a stoney face

427
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,360
even if you're laughing or smiling on

428
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,600
the inside sunshine yellow energy

429
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,199
they're just gonna see

430
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,120
your stoney face and they're gonna then

431
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,320
climb up and go right you're not

432
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,160
interested in what i have to say

433
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,920
i'm just gonna stop and and stop

434
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,279
engaging with you

435
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,120
show your involvement in their story

436
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,399
show your reactions

437
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,920
externally allow

438
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,120
sunshine yellow energies to talk about

439
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,040
their feelings and to share theirs

440
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,160
and other people's opinions let them air

441
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,519
what they want to say

442
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,920
um consider what they're saying even if

443
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,440
you don't sort of um

444
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,639
take it on if if you don't act on it

445
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,839
take on board what they have to say

446
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,600
if you're working with sunshine yellow

447
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,360
energy stay involved and

448
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,360
actively show that you're engaged if

449
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,360
you're working on a long-term project

450
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,600
have regular check-ins to say right i'm

451
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,600
still doing this here's where i'm up to

452
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,440
sunshine yellow will really really

453
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,199
appreciate sunshine yellow energy will

454
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,199
really really appreciate that

455
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,320
and lastly sunshine yellow energy they

456
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,040
are great

457
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,480
for coming up with all sorts of

458
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,079
different opportunities all sorts of

459
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,600
different ideas

460
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,720
but what they do lack is a little bit of

461
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,040
discipline in terms of setting an agenda

462
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,680
and setting exactly what you're going to

463
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,120
do because they come up with all these

464
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,720
brilliant ideas

465
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,320
when working and when communicating with

466
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,160
sunshine yellow energies you just need

467
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,920
to remember to give them a gentle nudge

468
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,959
and remind them

469
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,720
we've got an agenda we need to go

470
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,639
through it so that you can actually

471
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,360
achieve some

472
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,639
otherwise you'll have a great time

473
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,800
you'll have great ideas but you may not

474
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,079
actually achieve your

475
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,279
objective what i want to do now is just

476
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,199
have a little bit pause for thought

477
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,920
and kind of ask you to think about maybe

478
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,040
a conversation or

479
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,959
or an interaction you've had with a

480
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,800
colleague maybe someone from university

481
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,160
or whatever it might be

482
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,000
and just think when you've had maybe a

483
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
bit more of a difficult

484
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,199
interaction and think if you think back

485
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,120
could you maybe think of what column

486
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,040
energy they might have been leading with

487
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,120
and could you have adapted your

488
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,880
communication style

489
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,839
um to to make that interaction to make

490
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,199
that engagement a little bit better

491
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,759
thank you very much and i'll take any

492
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:24,399
questions

493
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,040
with a reminder that there is not that

494
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,279
long to go

495
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,600
thank you

496
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,839
uh listen thanks for um

497
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,160
trying to explain to people look i think

498
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,519
differently to you is a

499
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,360
really really difficult thing um and

500
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,720
it's something we don't actually

501
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,800
tell others like i take things in

502
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,839
differently to you or

503
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,600
you don't might not even be aware of it

504
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,040
i think it's really important to kind of

505
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,639
try and figure out where you are

506
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,480
it was only a few years ago i did like

507
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,240
the myers-briggs test and all that kind

508
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,199
of stuff and

509
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,320
surprise surprise i'm in the extrovert

510
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:00,880
side

511
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,680
and trying to understand how someone

512
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,559
who's

513
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,919
polar opposite to me interprets me being

514
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:08,400
loud

515
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,199
bombastic coming up with half caught

516
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,799
half

517
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,599
finished ideas and using them as a sound

518
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,400
board when

519
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,160
what they really want is a fully

520
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,839
finished product to be delivered to them

521
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,919
or a fully fleshed out idea before they

522
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,199
can give feedback

523
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,599
it's really really important to in my

524
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,240
mind to

525
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,400
to deal with that i know you touched on

526
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,400
it but dan khan did ask a question so i

527
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:30,799
just

528
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,559
thought i'd ask again just because you

529
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,400
had any further thoughts

530
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,280
um is it possible that someone can be a

531
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,440
combination of color energies

532
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,760
i know you touched absolutely so so

533
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,200
you're not just

534
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,919
one color energy you are very much a mix

535
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,039
and what it is is

536
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,440
there may be one or two color energies

537
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,240
that you're more

538
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,080
naturally um naturally aligned to

539
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,919
but you've got all four color energies

540
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,440
inside you and you can

541
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,960
um maybe with a little bit more of

542
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,120
conscious effort dial up any of the

543
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,200
other color energies that are not maybe

544
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,600
immediately obvious to you but everyone

545
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,320
is a mix of all four colors

546
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,280
oh um another question is coming from

547
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,160
hill nollie

548
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,559
asking do you find these communications

549
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,160
often end up being led by the

550
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,880
personality type of the person in charge

551
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,120
if a fiery red is in charge for example

552
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,039
and doesn't care about other energies it

553
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,320
ends up being very one-sided

554
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,280
um so it can do but then it's a case of

555
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,679
that's probably a failing of that person

556
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,039
because if they're not willing to um

557
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,200
recognize the color energies that other

558
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,039
people are leading with and adapt

559
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,840
their communication style then if it's

560
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,400
say

561
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,880
a manager with a team the team might

562
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,799
just shut down and go yeah fine whatever

563
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,240
you say we're just not gonna engage with

564
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,120
you we're just gonna

565
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,559
you tell us what to do and we'll do the

566
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,960
bare minimum type of thing but if you do

567
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,280
adapt your communication style you

568
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,160
hopefully get

569
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,919
more of that engagement and people might

570
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,080
offer up more alternatives and go

571
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,760
well actually that's a good way but have

572
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,440
you thought about doing it this other

573
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:03,840
way

574
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,240
which might may or may not be better

575
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:06,960
yeah

576
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,799
no no it's it's a really really valid

577
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,640
point sean any

578
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,720
any thoughts given that you are a

579
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,080
manager of a team what's your

580
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,320
yeah um so firstly

581
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,600
awesome talk um really great and i think

582
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,480
this touches

583
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,919
on a very important topic uh like

584
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,640
one of the things i i've i've seen many

585
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,200
and

586
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,120
i learned earlier on in my career is

587
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,919
it's all great being technical on that

588
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,320
but that's only half of the equation um

589
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,840
you need the soft skills and

590
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,400
communication is really important in

591
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:42,880
that

592
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,880
um and that's something that i as a

593
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,400
manager of a team

594
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,840
want to help build up my reports

595
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,440
and i don't want to see myself as a

596
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,679
manager but rather a leader

597
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,360
trying to guide them their way rather

598
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,360
than trying to force down my views

599
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,520
my own thoughts on them they should

600
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,919
decide i want them to grow

601
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,320
um so yeah um

602
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,760
and yeah uh

603
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,440
what do you think um we can do

604
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,400
uh to to help encourage people um be a

605
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,440
bit more

606
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,799
communicative i know there are happy

607
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,799
just sticking and isolating themselves

608
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,320
especially in a work environment

609
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,000
but in a work environment that's not

610
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,679
always good uh

611
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,039
because you need the communication

612
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,480
to understand what they're doing the

613
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,000
problems they're facing that kind of

614
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,320
thing

615
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,960
so what sort of things can we do as are

616
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,600
the managers or even team members

617
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,879
to to help with that

618
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,280
that's a really good question and a

619
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,799
really hard one um

620
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,360
i guess from my point of view one things

621
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,720
might be

622
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,760
if they are sort of hiding away they may

623
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,640
be um leaning with certain color

624
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,320
energies and if you can

625
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,360
sort of speak to that color energy then

626
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,720
that might encourage them to go oh

627
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,600
actually

628
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,320
people do get me people do understand me

629
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,760
maybe bring them out of their shell a

630
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,799
bit more and then

631
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,640
and then just not just over the course

632
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,200
of time we then be able to actually yeah

633
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,640
these people do want to be

634
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,039
around me want to hear my opinion uh and

635
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,880
then kind of grow that engagement there

636
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,159
is there is no

637
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,799
in my mind there's no quick fix for

638
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,159
these things it's all about that

639
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,720
building building trust building that

640
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,600
relationship

641
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,440
and and that's where communication is is

642
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,480
one of those key bits

643
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,799
yeah fantastic i totally agree

644
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,200
no i absolutely fantastic just genuinely

645
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,159
if you told me

646
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,120
10 15 years ago in my career um

647
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,640
communication is important i would have

648
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,280
went pish

649
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,799
and just not listened um because i was

650
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:51,600
young and

651
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,640
and arrogant et cetera like

652
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,919
most of us were um but it is when you

653
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,200
realize that everybody does

654
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,720
do things differently sean's just saying

655
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,480
they're like he wants to lead and kind

656
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,159
of guide the team rather than force it

657
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:04,880
down a route

658
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,960
um you know we we do a lot of that and

659
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,960
the beer farmers trying to get

660
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,640
to a goal like for example this

661
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,240
conference trying to get there

662
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,039
and we've got all these ideas floating

663
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:15,520
around

664
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,559
and everybody's got a different

665
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,120
personality type and trying to

666
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,559
fit us all into a category and

667
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,159
understand right okay well

668
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:23,760
you know sean thinks like this so i'm

669
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,360
going to present it to him in that way

670
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,000
so that he

671
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,919
understands what i'm saying not that

672
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,919
he's stupid or anything it's just more

673
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,760
i know that if i give him a stream of

674
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,200
consciousness he's just going to look at

675
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,039
it and go i don't understand this

676
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,799
similarly the reverse is true like i

677
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,240
don't mind the stream of consciousness

678
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,559
but don't expect me to come up with a

679
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,039
fully fledged answer straight away or i

680
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,280
might change my mind in 20 minutes or

681
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,799
anything like that i think communication

682
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,640
is just um

683
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,720
you you had the nail in the heads um and

684
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,679
it kind of

685
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,360
links back to the twitter stuff that we

686
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,640
were talking about you know people are

687
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:54,960
just

688
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,960
really super quick to judge and super

689
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,080
quick to not take

690
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,280
things you know go hey what context is

691
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:01,919
this person

692
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,679
actually giving here or you know is

693
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,360
there context i'm missing or

694
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,039
you know it's text-based communication

695
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,880
so um i guess

696
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,320
the final question would be how does

697
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,640
all this stuff impact face-to-face is

698
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,760
one thing

699
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,760
how does it change when it's text-based

700
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,480
communication is there is there another

701
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,840
level to that or do you just need to

702
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,679
take a breather before you go

703
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,200
okay i'll answer this or ask for

704
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,039
clarification

705
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,280
i think it's you you obviously need to

706
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,640
take a breather with with written

707
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,600
communication

708
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,480
um there is and again it's kind of like

709
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,520
i say this

710
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,559
is a 20-minute sort of talk about it

711
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,720
in the workshops it was several days

712
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,840
worth and

713
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,360
some of the bits was talking about like

714
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,520
written communication you can

715
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,080
learn to almost and twitter might be a

716
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:48,880
bit hard to do

717
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,799
but like in in longer form emails and

718
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,960
that you can you can learn to

719
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,520
pick up the cues of what sort of color

720
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,000
energy

721
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,960
are is the person writing with um and

722
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,520
then again

723
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,840
it's just learning about addressing that

724
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,960
color energy

725
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,600
so that you go into whatever mindset

726
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,039
they're in or whatever color energy

727
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,640
they're currently leading with

728
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,799
for them to take on board what you're

729
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,880
saying more easily

730
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,039
um and then i say just to have that

731
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,240
better engagement so it is possible um

732
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,000
that might be something for for another

733
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,080
talk maybe the written communication

734
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,360
side

735
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,840

736
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,960

737
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,840

738
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,240
