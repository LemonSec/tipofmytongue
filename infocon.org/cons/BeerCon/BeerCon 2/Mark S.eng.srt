1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,759
okay we're back

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,839
we didn't really go away did we but

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:08,960
we're here with mark

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,559
and mark's going to talk about uh talk

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,880
to us about fails uh the common fails

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,639
that we see in the context of security

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:15,440
so

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,720
from the point of view of a responder

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,279
so mark when you're ready over to you

10
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,520
mate

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,640
thanks very much mike um hi everyone

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,039
this is

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,400
shocking tales of common fails and

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,320
responders view um

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,559
sorry good start hi everyone um

16
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,840
uh i'm mark i'm a binary sleeper on

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,440
twitter started 19 years ago back in the

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,039
days before there was a windows start

19
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:47,920
button

20
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,640
and even before that and then moved on

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,399
into information security

22
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,840
uh currently i did some incident

23
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,000
response and investigation stuff amongst

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
other things

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,239
i tend to use information security as

26
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,520
it's a broader church in the commonly

27
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,800
used cyber security

28
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,080
because it's an old enough one that

29
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,479
cyber means something a bit filthy

30
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,439
and two it doesn't cover everything it's

31
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:09,760
uh

32
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,680
i'm interested in wherever information

33
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,960
goes

34
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,640
so filing cabinets people talking and

35
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,479
things like that

36
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,040
so what i'll be gathering about today

37
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,560
some common issues that hinder incident

38
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,680
response

39
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,960
and some common issues that cause or

40
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,799
exacerbate incidents i'll be drawing

41
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,400
mainly from my own experiences as a

42
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,680
responder

43
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,640
and uh also some of observations on sort

44
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:30,880
of

45
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,920
public uh incidents as well but to be

46
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,280
clear this is not a definitive guide

47
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,240
just things that have

48
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,320
um yeah i've encountered along the way

49
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,280
and made enough of an

50
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,920
impact on me to think you know i should

51
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,159
mention it

52
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,240
what i won't be gambling about is how to

53
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,600
fix this stuff well

54
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,079
maybe a bit where it's obvious but every

55
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,280
organization is different

56
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,720
they have different resources and

57
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,479
requirements so

58
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,560
yeah the mileage may vary

59
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,960
right first off fails part one logging

60
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,159
logs are not just for starship captains

61
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,840
first off what is logging logging at its

62
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,360
most fundamental is recording

63
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,480
um sorry excuse me uh recording uh

64
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,920
events that have occurred in the format

65
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,599
that allows later review

66
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,120
it's useful to tell us what is happening

67
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,640
and has happened on a system

68
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,319
it's pretty fundamental to you know for

69
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,840
troubleshooting investigation

70
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,040
and audit purposes so

71
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,120
first one the biggie the logs aren't

72
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,280
turned on

73
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,040
it's not going to help you with anything

74
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,319
yeah generally the first part of an

75
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,840
incident investigation we want to have a

76
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,360
look at the logs to ascertain what has

77
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,560
occurred

78
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,920
obviously if there are no logs it

79
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,120
becomes very difficult and it will

80
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,080
always leave another

81
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,760
large number of uncomfortable questions

82
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,760
going unanswered and can make effective

83
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,800
remediation

84
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,560
pretty difficult

85
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,800
many assume that logging is enabled by

86
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,800
default and often don't think they check

87
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,080
so do you know if it's on

88
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,000
are you really sure

89
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,959
it's uh not suitable for um the there is

90
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:07,760
no evidence of

91
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,120
response if you haven't got your logs

92
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,480
turned on say well there is no evidence

93
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:10,959
of

94
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,640
a breach there's no evidence of death

95
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,560
exaltation you're not going to get

96
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,760
anywhere

97
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,840
um because people will prod and you'll

98
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,280
be found wanting

99
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,280
it's a bit like the older cno evil

100
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,959
monkey

101
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,560
you know a common sort of example of

102
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,640
this not um

103
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,159
logging lock turned on problem is with

104
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,159
all the office 365 estates which do not

105
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,959
have audit logging turned on by default

106
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,640
often when a breach is detected usually

107
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,560
at the phishing propagation stage or

108
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,560
when a customer or supplier

109
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,159
phones up to inquire about where their

110
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,000
funds have gone

111
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,599
you'll have no idea when the breach

112
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,080
started what data was accessed you know

113
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,519
think of things like onedrive

114
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,080
and sharepoint as well as the email uh

115
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,440
or what actions the attacker took and

116
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,519
may still be taking so

117
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,480
it's a it's a fundamental thing have

118
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,119
your logs on

119
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,280
next often the logs aren't fit for

120
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,959
purpose assuming that we've got logging

121
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:03,920
turned on

122
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,120
you know the next most common favorites

123
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,319
of the logs do not record what is

124
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,920
required for the investigation and

125
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,200
whatever the nature of the investigation

126
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,319
is it could be for

127
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,000
security breach could be for audit it

128
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,080
could be for trouble shooting yeah

129
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,160
uh make sure your logs are fit for

130
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,440
purpose you know

131
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,519
and a log may have more than one purpose

132
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,639
here

133
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,759
so you know check with all the

134
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,000
stakeholders

135
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,600
yeah an investigation would generally

136
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,040
require information to help answer the

137
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,000
five w's and one

138
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,440
h who what where when why and how

139
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,000
um next the logs record meaningful

140
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,520
information

141
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,600
um you know do they have meaningful

142
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,199
usernames

143
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,919
they got some source addresses did they

144
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:42,720
tell you what

145
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,280
you know what occurred what data was

146
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,000
accessed

147
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,040
what functions were used can you tell

148
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,919
what someone did

149
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,639
from your logs

150
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,600
next one can you share your logs with

151
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,720
third parties

152
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,560
often logs can contain sensitive

153
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,639
information so if you have it in debug

154
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,320
mode you might be dumping passwords

155
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,240
credit card details in there

156
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,199
other pii and things like that you may

157
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,919
have

158
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,160
um people's names or document names in

159
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,120
there which

160
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,759
are being logged and uh you can't share

161
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,240
it with

162
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,759
third parties because it could be

163
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,360
another technical breach

164
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,880
so if you've got this type of stuff make

165
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,639
sure you've got a way to you know

166
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,600
clean or sanitize your logs yeah ndas

167
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,039
will get you so far but sometimes you're

168
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,479
just not allowed to

169
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,680
move the stuff on now you can hand for

170
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,360
analysis by third parties especially

171
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,880
again in an incident

172
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,000
next we've got insufficient coverage

173
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,320
um yeah you've got insufficient uh

174
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,000
retention it's got to cover the period

175
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,800
of the incident

176
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,320
now this is a bit of a how long is a

177
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,000
piece of string uh

178
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,720
question you know you don't know how

179
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,320
long your incident is so basically look

180
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,600
at industry standards

181
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,120
and also your compliance requirements

182
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,800
for sort of you know guidance on how

183
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,240
long you should be keeping logs

184
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,440
they don't need to be necessarily

185
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,199
readily accessible online but just they

186
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,560
just have to be there

187
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,680
accessible at some point

188
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,800
another problem and fail is log rolling

189
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,039
um some logs are set to roll after a

190
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,319
certain number of events or a certain

191
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,039
amount of time

192
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,479
and it's going to overwrite potentially

193
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,960
crucial information

194
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,479
a lot of fireballs do this in default

195
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:17,759
they don't have a lot of storage on

196
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:18,240
board

197
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,120
and they will you know roll after seven

198
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,880
days or after certain

199
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,160
events and this can also be abused by

200
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,840
attackers because they can generate a

201
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,600
number of spurious

202
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,199
um events to basically roll the log and

203
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,600
cover their tracks

204
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,280
next we've got missing systems you know

205
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,360
where not all systems are covered

206
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,120
uh for example you might not be logging

207
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,120
bandwidth usage so you can't tell

208
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,680
you know what an attacker exfiltrated

209
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,280
how much data do they slip um

210
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,479
yeah you might not be uh recording

211
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,319
um access to certain other systems here

212
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,080
it's got missing systems where part yeah

213
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,599
which are part of the information chain

214
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,479
so for example you look at your owa logs

215
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,000
uh your owa um

216
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,479
how low web access will be uninitiated

217
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:07,840
is sitting behind

218
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,160
a load balancer and it will record the

219
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,759
ip address of the load balancer

220
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,160
that's no good for an investigation so

221
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,520
you also want to be able to correlate

222
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,720
that with the load balancers launch to

223
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,880
see the actual true ip address behind

224
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,880
it and again for dhcp leases

225
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,160
if you uh are recording ip addresses

226
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,919
which are given out by dhcp

227
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,960
at least internally and do you know

228
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,199
who or what system had that ip address

229
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,800
at that time so

230
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,240
you need to make sure that the whole

231
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,360
information chain is uh is present

232
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,720
next the logs not secured

233
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,160
um if an attacker's had

234
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,680
you know some root access or full access

235
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,319
to a system uh there's a big possibility

236
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:50,639
that

237
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,879
the logs can be tampered with um that's

238
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,240
always very worrying because if they

239
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,680
have been tampered with

240
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,400
you know what they tried to hide and

241
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,800
again they can be cleared or reset

242
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,759
now you know a lot of this stuff is good

243
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,120
upset you should always you know cover

244
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,720
your tracks as an attacker a lot of

245
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,599
attackers don't seem to bother but when

246
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:10,720
they do

247
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,160
it leaves that horrible question what

248
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,919
are they trying to hide

249
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,360
makes it difficult to see what they did

250
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,560
and therefore it's very difficult to

251
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,840
remediate

252
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,160
um against and also answer certain

253
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,520
questions

254
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,879
so next third-party system logs

255
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,400
the continued growth of cloud provided

256
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,319
services that all uh organizations are

257
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,360
using

258
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,440
and there's loads of services and online

259
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,039
applications

260
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,240
uh you combine this with the

261
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,240
ever-present bugbear of password reuse

262
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,760
you know if you find a user's

263
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,000
credentials being compromised

264
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,599
uh there's concern that the attacker may

265
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,039
have used those credentials elsewhere in

266
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,720
a password stopping or the credential

267
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,440
stopping your

268
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,920
personal spreading attack against other

269
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,200
well-known services you know

270
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,240
um that you might have accounts on so

271
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,279
therefore you've got to check whether

272
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,480
these

273
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,399
um third party you know logins have

274
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,240
occurred

275
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,680
um you know we've come across certain

276
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,760
systems with woefully inadequate logging

277
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,720
or audit trails

278
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,320
you know just a username and a timer

279
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,720
logged on no source ip address no

280
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,800
systems access no functions used whether

281
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,600
you know

282
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,680
um how long they were in there for ones

283
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,279
on that so

284
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,480
make sure you know they meet your

285
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,880
logging requirements figure out what the

286
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,959
limits are you know do they only

287
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,760
log 25 000 events um do they have

288
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,279
retention periods you know

289
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,680
do they you know do they roll them after

290
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,120
a week or only keep them for three

291
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,240
months

292
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,600
do they have relevant and meaningful

293
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,519
information you know

294
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,800
what are their turnaround times and

295
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,240
escalation points you know it's a third

296
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,000
party you asking for the logs

297
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,040
you hope they're going to get them to

298
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,240
you quickly because you're in the middle

299
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,640
of an incident time is a factor

300
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,279
um they've got other priorities you know

301
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,640
do you have escalation points if they're

302
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,360
failing to do it

303
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,680
and are they contractually obliged to

304
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,120
provide this information they might turn

305
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,160
around and say

306
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,680
no um yeah it'll cost us time and money

307
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,319
we're not doing it

308
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,959
so make sure you've got these things uh

309
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,240
in place

310
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,720
should i ideally be sort of uh dealt

311
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,399
with at the procurement stage

312
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,000
yeah and detailed and contract wording

313
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,519
don't just take someone's word and

314
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,240
handshake for it

315
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,519
mentioned earlier there'll be some

316
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,040
uncomfortable questions that you would

317
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,800
have trouble answering

318
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,640
these are them here you know basically

319
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,560
if you've had a breach or an incident

320
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,440
people want to know

321
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,360
how long you were breached for what data

322
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,880
was breached what data was exfiltrated

323
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,880
uh yeah who buy and admittedly this is

324
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,880
very difficult to know

325
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,360
but having a at least some clue would be

326
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,040
you know go some way to

327
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,000
um making people happier at least you're

328
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,240
trying to find out or can find out

329
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,480
and also are you now secure if you don't

330
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,920
know what happened

331
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,680
how can you you know say you're now

332
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,959
secure against it so

333
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,760
that's part two uh alerts alerting and

334
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,720
monitoring

335
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,160
setting up alerting helps identify

336
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,240
things that should be investigated and

337
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,240
dealt with so if a system is set to

338
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,600
generate

339
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,040
make sure they are monitored

340
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,079
uh and also if you're generating alerts

341
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,120
make sure that they are

342
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,200
on point you don't want too many too

343
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,399
many alerts to

344
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,040
vague alerts you don't want to overload

345
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,079
the people having to

346
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,160
to deal with them you get alert fatigue

347
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,279
and they ignore it and you get some

348
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,560
conversations with them saying well i

349
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,079
see you have this alert here

350
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,000
and they go oh we're always getting that

351
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,720
or it's just another alert

352
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,160
that's really something you don't want

353
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:26,900
to um

354
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,160
[Music]

355
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,880
be subject to finally make sure there

356
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,440
are

357
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,079
clear lines of authority yeah if someone

358
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,680
is receiving alerts make sure they feel

359
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,720
empowered to

360
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,519
either act upon them or know who to

361
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,320
contact to escalate it to uh you don't

362
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,760
want someone there saying oh i think the

363
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,920
ceo's email account is breached

364
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,680
should i disable it or not you know you

365
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,200
don't want the mummy you want

366
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,720
to be feel comfortable to shut that

367
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,560
thing down right now

368
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,040
um and then you know go on it's from

369
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,880
there

370
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,480
um and you know you don't also want to

371
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,320
be the organization where

372
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,839
yeah an alert comes in friday at

373
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,600
quitting time and

374
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,920
they think i'll deal with it on monday

375
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,519
and over the weekend there's a

376
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,399
you know ventilation device interface

377
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,000
and you've got a whole world of pain

378
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,440
coming in yeah monday morning

379
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,959
yeah a lot of attackers plan their

380
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,240
activities for time periods that they

381
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,200
don't think will be monitored

382
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,800
first part three missing basic controls

383
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,079
uh there's a lot of basic controls and

384
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,000
security they're no particular mystery

385
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,720
there's sometimes half or two but yeah

386
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,399
um

387
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,240
they should be done so first off lack of

388
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,839
appropriate access controls should have

389
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,519
things like 2fa and mfa

390
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,200
on public safe are publicly accessible

391
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,360
services you know

392
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,480
you get a lot of organizations with

393
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,079
out-of-date password policies and they

394
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:44,399
make

395
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,000
horribly complex passwords you've got to

396
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,240
change them very often it's

397
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,240
no longer you know the guidance and it

398
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,079
hasn't been that for a while you know

399
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,519
you want some you know long passes

400
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,720
people can remember and

401
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,240
change them when they feel they should

402
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,920
don't keep forcing them

403
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,839
uh because it leads them to bad habits

404
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:00,959
we had a case where

405
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,880
um the breach was caused by someone who

406
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,560
managed to use the same password that

407
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,160
was in the linkedin bridge

408
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,440
they had basically gone through the

409
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,279
several hundred um

410
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,360
you know cannot use the last so 100

411
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,399
passwords

412
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,279
uh over the seven plus years and rotated

413
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,720
back to one they'd use that was in the

414
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,720
breach

415
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,360
attackers were in and i suspect that's

416
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,399
the case and more than one

417
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,720
uh occurrence but kudos to the internal

418
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,320
team who figured that out and

419
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,680
to the user being honest about it

420
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,320
next for patching practices um patching

421
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,200
is complex

422
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,320
we fraught with dangers if you've got

423
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,399
unstable systems

424
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,000
but it's an effective control it's done

425
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,600
properly

426
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,360
these days the time from cve publication

427
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,880
to active exploitation seems to be

428
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,079
shortening

429
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,760
so designing systems that are rapidly

430
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,120
patchable along with all the testing

431
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,680
requirements is a must these days

432
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,120
uh and even when a patch was released

433
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,199
months before organizations have failed

434
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:53,760
the patch

435
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,120
you know cbe um 2019-11510

436
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,519
the pulse secure vpn comes to mind in

437
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,880
this one

438
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,800
months later people were being taken out

439
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,600
next poor network segmentation uh a good

440
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,800
network segmentation can hinder the

441
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,040
lateral movement of an attacker and also

442
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,800
of malware and it also helps you

443
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,720
resource um secure resources

444
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,760
more easily this is especially an issue

445
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,959
if you've got a cardholder data

446
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,880
environment for pci dcf

447
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,880
dss exposed in secure services

448
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,199
uh the main one that i encounter is rdp

449
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,160
and

450
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,760
it's not just small organizations you

451
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,880
know having it there for their

452
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,240
accountant to come and do their books

453
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,199
once a month

454
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,440
uh it's also large organizations who you

455
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,440
know you think would know better

456
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,519
um it's definitely one of the prevalent

457
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,120
first access points in the ransomware

458
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,760
cases i

459
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,839
encounter yeah basically if a service is

460
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,079
insecure stick it behind a vpn

461
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,959
preferably one that's patched obviously

462
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,399
uh secure backups

463
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,560
offsite or logically separate um

464
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,760
talented ransomware actions they want

465
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,199
one thing they want your money so

466
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,000
they're going to do everything

467
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,279
in their power to force you into a

468
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,680
position where you know the only option

469
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,560
is to pay them

470
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,000
the ransom to get your data back

471
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,920
so they'll target key systems and hunt

472
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,440
for your backups and they'll burn them

473
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,800
to the ground

474
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,839
and they can you know uh nas boxes are

475
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,880
a popular um favorite they

476
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,880
encrypt the backups on the nas boxes and

477
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,959
then they reset them to factual defaults

478
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,560
uh they're making it very difficult to

479
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,240
recover your data and they want you to

480
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:24,959
pay

481
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,639
so basically having backups and attacker

482
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,320
in the network can't reach is a good

483
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,560
thing

484
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,120
for um historical nasties

485
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,600
old data lurking the debts you know if

486
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,320
you

487
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,639
haven't got a good um sort of data life

488
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,360
cycle

489
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,040
um people don't know what to do with the

490
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,800
data good data lifecycle should indicate

491
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,600
how you install

492
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,519
transmit and process data how long you

493
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,959
should keep it for and finally you just

494
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,800
dispose of it lots of other things it

495
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,240
should have as well like you know source

496
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,519
consent owner

497
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,920
et cetera but you know i'd sell for the

498
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,839
first bits as a starter

499
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,160
if the life cycle is poorly documented

500
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,680
um no one actually adheres to it

501
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,560
uh even if it exists um the data has a

502
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,839
habit of leaking and spreading to where

503
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:06,639
it should not

504
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,160
so you get things like old copies which

505
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,160
are untracked um people

506
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,079
you know take a copy somewhere just for

507
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,480
a quick copy or even to a local device

508
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,279
because they're just going to do

509
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,680
something just in case

510
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,440
you've been working on file shares you

511
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,199
know people migrate file servers

512
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,519
email servers um are another place where

513
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,880
this data can work

514
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,800
case management systems often have no

515
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,720
way of cleaning out whole data

516
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,759
beyond its retention period um email

517
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,440
servers are in a particular

518
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,759
bug bear you know you've got the um the

519
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:36,959
cc problem

520
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,800
uh people don't know what they've got in

521
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,160
their mailboxes

522
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,759
i had a case where um someone was cc

523
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,040
and there was an attachment with a

524
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,199
spreadsheet which had some calculations

525
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:48,639
of various things

526
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,000
someone had dumped an export from a

527
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,880
database with users passwords

528
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,519
loads of their pii uh into a sheet and

529
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:56,000
then

530
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,560
ran some calcs off that and the thing

531
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,560
was none of that pii or sensitive data

532
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,519
was actually

533
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,279
necessary for the accounts so this thing

534
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,720
went round to a number of people and

535
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,160
most of them when i've actually been

536
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,439
aware that this data was sitting in

537
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,559
their mailbox so

538
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,240
if you think people are clearing out

539
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,559
their mail from sensitive data

540
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,679
chances are they're not they probably

541
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,640
don't know what they've got

542
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,599
um there also lots of other places it

543
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,319
can be

544
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,640
you know unsecured cloud storage and s3

545
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,720
buckets and that personal devices

546
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,960
data moves about um

547
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,559
old systems you know hidden outside

548
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,000
you've got abandoned it systems and

549
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,200
unsupported systems

550
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,720
you know police station for a first

551
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,240
incident will tend to do a quick bit of

552
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,000
uh ocean reconnaissance

553
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,160
looking at an organization's emails some

554
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,120
setups

555
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,840
and what else they've got to publish on

556
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,039
the internet

557
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,880
and arsenal find systems that they've

558
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,400
completely forgotten about are unaware

559
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,280
of here that they thought were

560
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,559
decommissioned

561
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:51,840
and i mean this is particularly

562
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,120
prevalent with things like on-premise

563
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,200
exchange where they've moved to

564
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,840
exchange in the cloud and they've got

565
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,640
old machines

566
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,640
you know sitting there probably yeah

567
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,360
still got copies of mailboxes on it

568
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,120
the system can hold all copies of data

569
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,120
and also can

570
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,640
might not be maintained because no one's

571
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,320
aware of them therefore they become

572
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,679
particularly vulnerable they might be an

573
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,440
entry point into your network

574
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,559
so it's always good to do a little

575
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,640
recoil on your exterior

576
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,000
unsupported systems are particularly

577
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,640
juicy targets as not only they're likely

578
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,000
to be vulnerable but they're also

579
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,600
indicators of an organization's

580
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,960
security posture and therefore might

581
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,400
make an attacker more curious to dig

582
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,200
about a bit

583
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,640
and see what else they might find of

584
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,039
interest you know all color hats go on

585
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,520
show than safaris

586
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,880
fails part five organizational issues

587
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,679
decision making big one the decision

588
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:42,720
makers

589
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,320
need to be available you know they

590
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,080
shouldn't be out of contact or going on

591
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,919
a plane journey for several hours mid

592
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,120
incident

593
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,880
you want to be there to make decisions

594
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,200
quickly in a timely fashion

595
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,120
slow decision making processes often you

596
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,640
find that sometimes you've got to put a

597
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,480
decision to a committee or a board or

598
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,360
something like that

599
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,280
or through a legal process make sure

600
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,200
that those decision making

601
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,799
bodies have got a fast track

602
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,559
process so you can get things done uh

603
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,200
you know in a timely fashion

604
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,039
um slow engagement processes if you need

605
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,400
to engage with third parties make sure

606
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,280
you can do it quickly

607
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,720
know what needs to be done in terms of

608
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,720
contracts ndas payments make sure all

609
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,200
the

610
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,240
right people are lined up

611
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,520
money for instant response yeah it can

612
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,799
cost you sometimes

613
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,520
so make sure you've got someone with

614
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,200
executive spending power i used to make

615
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,120
a policy of knowing who has

616
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,640
company credit cards i could always go

617
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,160
and find someone to mug in an emergency

618
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,200
uh if you've got insurance make sure you

619
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,559
know what your coverage is you know

620
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,080
don't find out

621
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,360
at the incident and try and figure out

622
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,480
how you covered or not you should know

623
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,760
this stuff beforehand

624
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,600
know what services are available to you

625
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,960
what you can do what the limits of your

626
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,200
cutter the cover are

627
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,400
you know who's the contacts are etc

628
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,120
uh and important thing if you've got an

629
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,320
access

630
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,480
make sure you know everyone's happy that

631
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,360
you're going to be

632
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,559
eating into that excess when you

633
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,039
activate your insurance policy

634
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,960
don't be you know dithering about

635
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,559
deciding whether you know

636
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,679
is it sufficient have that decided

637
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:18,720
beforehand yeah

638
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,760
you should know what your limits are

639
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,679
before you go into establish that

640
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,360
next availability of key personnel

641
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,360
make sure your key personnel are

642
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,480
available yeah

643
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,200
um if they're not there you could be

644
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,520
stuffed

645
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,039
know who they are um not you know not be

646
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,159
gambling about trying to find out you

647
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,240
know who deals with that it should be

648
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:42,880
clear but

649
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,480
in part you're into response plans yeah

650
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,640
who the key people are

651
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,200
and it does make help to um but it does

652
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,440
help to make sure that um

653
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,120
people are you know uh aware of each

654
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,480
other if they don't know each other

655
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,840
personally at least they know who

656
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,280
the other people are thanks for a

657
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,880
smoother incidents

658
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,640
at work um personnel can be you know the

659
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,400
key personnel can be third parties again

660
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,440
make sure that they are

661
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,840
um yeah contractually obliged and you

662
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,280
know what you're dealing with

663
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,799
uh any other things you keep personal

664
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,720
make sure you've got alternates you know

665
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,720
people go on holiday people get sick and

666
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,520
make sure there's cover yeah

667
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,120
and of course make sure you can contact

668
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,640
them make sure you maintain contact

669
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,880
details emergency contact details

670
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,080
i've approached council when people are

671
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,760
going to be out of contact so yeah

672
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,840
ultimates can be activated

673
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,120
um yeah it's a bit of a pain to do but

674
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,440
makes life a lot easier when the things

675
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,440
have planned

676
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,120
contractual stuff make sure your key

677
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,440
personnel are available for emergencies

678
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,840
they might have other things outside

679
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,960
um work that

680
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,640
they will deem more important they might

681
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,080
have child care issues they might have

682
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,720
to look after you know someone else uh

683
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,280
you can't

684
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,480
expect them necessarily to drop

685
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,840
everything and come to the aid of the

686
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,640
company

687
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,000
um if there are people who are likely to

688
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,280
have issues with that identify them

689
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,400
early and make sure you can

690
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,159
you know figure out some way around it

691
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,840
you know um

692
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,679
you know offer someone to pick you know

693
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,039
taxi to go and pick up their kids from

694
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,000
school raw

695
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,520
um alternate care for

696
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,000
their people who need to be careful

697
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,280
don't just assume that they'll drop

698
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,039
everything

699
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,360
um third parties uh if you're dealing

700
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,200
with third parties don't assume that

701
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,400
they're gonna

702
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,320
do all the staff for instant response

703
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,600
for free

704
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,799
it might not be in the contract they

705
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,000
might say this is going to cost you

706
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,640
extra

707
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,159
and be prepared for that third parties

708
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,280
there could also be a conflict of

709
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:31,760
interest

710
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,520
if someone's managing a service it gets

711
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,039
breached um

712
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,480
are you sure you want only them

713
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,159
investigating it

714
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,200
they may be covering stuff up um so

715
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,799
and again if you need to make insurance

716
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,400
claim or something like that

717
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,240
uh it could be tricky if um

718
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,720
you know the conflict of interest aren't

719
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,720
dealt with correctly

720
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,720
uh third party again response times you

721
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,840
know um

722
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,440
are they going to dance to your cadence

723
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,440
you know um

724
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,880
you'll be wanting to do things quickly

725
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,720
they'll have their own requirements

726
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,640
their own uh other work to do

727
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,159
so make sure again you've got something

728
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,880
like an sla in place to make sure they

729
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,200
would

730
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,640
respond in times of incident

731
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,600
data projection and gdpr not processing

732
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,960
data in same ways

733
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,600
you know come across people scanning

734
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,960
sensitive documents into

735
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,440
cloud-based email systems yeah don't do

736
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,520
it doesn't need to be there

737
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,080
um yeah transmitting data in unsecured

738
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,039
ways you know

739
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,000
still people out there using sdp um

740
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,520
really not good

741
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,520
um sharing too much information with

742
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,360
third parties you know you might need to

743
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,640
you know send a marketing list to

744
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,159
someone doesn't need to have the

745
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:41,679
performance database dump out there

746
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,520
again like my cc

747
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,679
um email example earlier too much

748
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:46,960
information was in this pressure didn't

749
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,919
need to be there

750
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,360
and again there was a recent incident

751
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,360
with virgin media where some stuff was

752
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,640
sent to a marketing company and there

753
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,039
was

754
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,400
loads of extraneous information that

755
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,400
didn't need to be there

756
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,559
so yeah make sure you clean that stuff

757
00:23:58,559 --> 00:23:59,600
before you send it out

758
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,880
um payment processes fraud big thing

759
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,120
criminals want money and they're pretty

760
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,600
good at getting it

761
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,000
so common way is um some payment

762
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,960
interception to get in the middle of a

763
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,080
a transaction uh and change the details

764
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:16,559
yeah

765
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,039
they'll either fiddle with their invoice

766
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,240
or they'll just send another email

767
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,760
saying oh that bank account is currently

768
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,960
under order it's frozen

769
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,320
can you send it to this bank account

770
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,559
instead lots of ways of doing it

771
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:27,919
basically go and check through another

772
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,880
medium and that that is the person

773
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,320
uh you think you're talking to and that

774
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,640
you know the details have changed

775
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,400
uh another one is separation of payment

776
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,559
duties same person should not be able to

777
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:39,840
raise the payment and authorize a

778
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,120
payment yeah you want to have some sort

779
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,360
of dual control there

780
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,960
solves a lot of ills security disclosure

781
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,679
contact

782
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,799
um she's gonna have a proper channel to

783
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,159
report security issues um you know

784
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,520
people scratching around to find out who

785
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,799
do i talk to i found a security issue

786
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,159
don't make it too hard for people to

787
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:01,279
report security issues because they

788
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,159
might just not

789
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,000
bother in the end and uh you know you

790
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,200
will have a breach later when someone

791
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,400
else finds it and

792
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,720
it's not so kind also make sure the

793
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,080
process is in place to deal with

794
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,600
reported issues make sure that they're

795
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,159
you know

796
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:13,840
verified and dealt with correctly and

797
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,600
you know you know sort of a sane and

798
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,919
professional manager don't treat them as

799
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,440
service issues because otherwise they

800
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,240
might not get

801
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,840
you know the uh sort of security

802
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,679
expertise that they need

803
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,279
uh i mean yeah imagine having a breach

804
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,799
where someone announces publicly that

805
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,080
they told you about the vulnerability

806
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,720
months earlier and you did nothing you

807
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,320
know regulatory authorities customers

808
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,000
and press can all take quite an interest

809
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,480
lack of skills lack of key skills for

810
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,000
systems involved in incidents sometimes

811
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,559
people get

812
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,480
systems in and they don't have the

813
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,400
skills internally all the skills migrate

814
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,039
uh outwards uh so make sure you've got

815
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,240
that covered make sure you

816
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,840
you're recording who who can you know

817
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,640
uh work on these systems uh again key

818
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,320
personal reliance make sure you you know

819
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,440
if you've got someone only one person

820
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,640
with these skills make sure there's an

821
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,679
alternate who can at least

822
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,880
do what's needed in an incident

823
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,159
fails part six uh communications pr

824
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,080
notifications not controlling the

825
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,360
message

826
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,880
don't move or panic people don't leave

827
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,159
unanswered questions that could easily

828
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,200
be answered in the message otherwise

829
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,400
you've got a load of inquiries that you

830
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,360
just don't need

831
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,520
but you know had a busy time uh lack of

832
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,559
preparation make sure you've got

833
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,000
mechanisms to identify who should be

834
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,440
notified how to send and measure

835
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,080
responses and deal with inquiries

836
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,760
uh make sure you've got resources for

837
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,120
this you might need to bring in you know

838
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,559
an outside call center things like that

839
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:31,520
make sure you

840
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,039
you've got an idea of how you're going

841
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,679
to deal with their notification

842
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,080
poor comms unclear messaging making

843
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,760
unsupported statements using stock

844
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,760
phrases we take your security seriously

845
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,279
military grade unhackable advanced

846
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,120
attack all these things that

847
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,360
most of us look at and say yeah bs

848
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,159
summary thoughts no organization is

849
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:52,799
perfect

850
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,400
there are a lot of things to do to

851
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,720
improve but limited resources

852
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,640
prioritize your risks be realistic try

853
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,480
threat modelling

854
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,480
think what can go wrong plan scenarios

855
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,520
for you

856
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,120
be sure the stakeholders are aware and

857
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,039
can assign resource or at least accept

858
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,000
the risk

859
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,600
and identify where the buck stops make

860
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,880
sure you know who's accountable and

861
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,840
responsible for various things

862
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,760
and run simulation exercises they don't

863
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,200
need to be complex but they help you

864
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,399
sort of iron out any kinks in your

865
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:18,960
process

866
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,399
and you know get everyone into the right

867
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,480
frame of mind you know no plans surprise

868
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,919
first contact

869
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:25,600
and the other thing is things cost money

870
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,440
plan for it you know you know things

871
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,120
have got uh obsolescence here in

872
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,880
in five years and os is going to go out

873
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,320
so you want to be replacing in three

874
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:32,799
years

875
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,399
budget for that don't say oh we haven't

876
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,679
got money that's just poor planning

877
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,039
thank you for listening everyone big

878
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,480

brilliant mark thank you very much

889
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,559
excellent a lot of detail in there

890
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,039
and i think people will watch back this

891
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:01,840
talk

892
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,279
certainly from an organizational point

893
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,360
of view and learn a lot of stuff

894
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,080
so really super cool i've got a question

895
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:08,559
for you

896
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:11,840
um back to you

897
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,320
your comment around breaches so in your

898
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,159
experience what would you think would be

899
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:17,760
a typical amount of effort

900
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,919
applied to trying to find out who'd done

901
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,039
it in a breach

902
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,600
versus fixing or forward fixing the

903
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,399
problem and

904
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,240
dealing with the outcome or dealing with

905
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,880
the fall out of it

906
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,559
um i mean first i mean you see where it

907
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,720
sort of sort of takes you but generally

908
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,120
you'll pretty much hit a dead end behind

909
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,000
vpns and

910
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,640
uh and other sort of forms of um proxies

911
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,000
like residential proxies and things like

912
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,399
that

913
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,399
but it can give you a little bit of an

914
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:43,440
insight to

915
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,000
what technologies they're using um you

916
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,120
know if they're using residential

917
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,559
proxies they're probably slightly more

918
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:49,840
advanced they're they're

919
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,559
trying to fly below the radar if they're

920
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,799
using vpns that are associated with free

921
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,880
vpn people they're probably not so well

922
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,000
funded

923
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,039
you know you've got a lot of these free

924
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,760
vpns you can use um

925
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,120
you know tall proxies are they coming

926
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,720
out from there but again once you sort

927
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,039
of hit that wall um

928
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,880
you know a commercial investigation is

929
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,799
not really going to make

930
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,039
any headway against that you need law

931
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,240
enforcement um

932
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,440
uh clout um

933
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,520
so yeah that's about as far as you can

934
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,039
go but you should at least look

935
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,840
to see yeah you never know yeah could be

936
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,960
some idiot from there

937
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,640
from their home saying they might have

938
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,559
had an upset fail and you can say ah

939
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,240
yeah you might get lucky and

940
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,399
sometimes an upset fail is is something

941
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:35,600
that happens and um

942
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,360
yeah the attackers reveal themselves

943
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,679
yeah it's rare but you know you're going

944
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,399
so far yeah okay great answer thank you

945
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:43,200
for that

946
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,399
um yeah again really good talk

947
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,799
excellent thanks very much mark yep we

948
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:55,840
really appreciate your time
