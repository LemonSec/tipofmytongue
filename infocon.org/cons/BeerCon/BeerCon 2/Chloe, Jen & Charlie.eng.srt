1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:04,880
okay

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,040
welcome back everybody and uh to kick us

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,880
off this morning we've got a

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,120
a triple header so we've got uh chloe

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,280
jennifer and claire

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,759
and charlie joining us couldn't get that

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:16,800
right the first thing i've had to do

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,840
today really

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,600
um but we'll try that one again chloe

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,800
jennifer and charlie are going to be

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,359
talking to us about hackathons and ctfs

12
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,880
so good morning to the three of you

13
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,320
welcome and it's over to you okay

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,599
brilliant um welcome uh

15
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,079
with today's talk is about a beginner's

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:34,719
guide to

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,120
hackathons and ctfs from our

18
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,559
perspectives which is

19
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,920
mostly beginners uh we are

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,840
i'm chloe i'm a student currently

21
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,680
studying cyber security and i've taken

22
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,399
part in a few

23
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,079
capture the flags and hackathons i'm jen

24
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,680
i'm a cyber security professional i've

25
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,360
taken part in quite a few

26
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,399
hackathons and ctfs as well and i'm

27
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,000
charlie i'm a cyber security student

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,760
and i mostly take part in capture the

29
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,000
flags

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,640
so what's this talk about uh it's gonna

31
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,640
be an introduction to some ctfs

32
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,040
and hackathons uh we're gonna talk about

33
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,360
some stories from past events

34
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,159
and sort of what we've learned from that

35
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:14,960
and

36
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,320
how you can get started uh doing these

37
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,200
so we'll start off with the differences

38
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:21,759
between

39
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,960
a ctf and a hackathon

40
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,400
so a ctf is a a series of cyber security

41
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,880
challenges to you would work through

42
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,600
them

43
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,240
uh to capture a flag which is usually

44
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,079
either a string of text a text file it

45
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,840
could be anything really

46
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,680
but the idea is that you hack through

47
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,439
each challenge to get

48
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,119
to the end which is the flag you'll

49
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,960
usually be in competition with other

50
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,439
people

51
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,640
and we'll talk more about the

52
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,320
competition aspect side of it a bit

53
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,600
later

54
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,079
a hackathon is on the other side a more

55
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,159
creative endeavor so that is a

56
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,000
sort of event where everyone gets

57
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,600
together and

58
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,920
tries to solve a problem that either the

59
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,280
community faces

60
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,840
a company faces an organization and

61
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,439
these will be hosted to get

62
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,038
more technical people into talking about

63
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,239
issues and challenges that are less

64
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,160
technically facing

65
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,879
these are quite fun when you get when

66
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:19,360
you're

67
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,080
starting out because they are quite

68
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,959
open-ended

69
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,160
and you get um you can really

70
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,000
try out quite a lot of different things

71
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,280
so i'll pass over to

72
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,000
uh one of the other two for how they how

73
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
can this help the community

74
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,319
um so it helps everyone get into a

75
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,680
different mindset because

76
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,519
if you're going to a hackathon or a

77
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,200
couch or you're taking part in a capture

78
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:45,840
the flag

79
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,319
you need to think outside the box and

80
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,920
come up with creative new ways of

81
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,519
solving a challenge or creating

82
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:52,640
something

83
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,319
um they're also really good for meeting

84
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,640
new people making new contacts

85
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,040
um because there's always really

86
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,239
interesting people who attend these

87
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,080
events

88
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,599
and it's also really good for developing

89
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,840
new skills

90
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,959
yeah um i couldn't say better myself

91
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,560
um so basically what we've learned is um

92
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,800
how to meet you know meet new people and

93
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,000
work effectively in that team

94
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,879
time correctly

95
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,440
sorry uh it's just frozen there for a

96
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,519
second

97
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,519
new technologies are different ways of

98
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:34,720
doing things

99
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,920
um and the use of new programs and tools

100
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,560
and charlie q

101
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,239
yeah so yep so with ctfs

102
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,400
and hackathons you've got it's a lot

103
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,840
easier to actually do them

104
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,400
when you're working in teams and a lot

105
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,200
of these events

106
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,040
you don't pick your team until the

107
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,280
actual event begins

108
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,599
as well so you've also got to make sure

109
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,799
because these things are time

110
00:03:58,799 --> 00:03:59,840
constraints

111
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,239
and a lot of them run for a couple hours

112
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,519
to a couple days

113
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,799
you've got to make sure you're managing

114
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,239
your time effectively so you're not one

115
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,040
of those people

116
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,040
that's in the last 10 minutes actually

117
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,640
furiously typing on their keyboard

118
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,200
because

119
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,839
nobody would ever dream of doing that

120
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,320
we will talk several points in this

121
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,079
presentation about how important time

122
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,358
management is

123
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,280
except i've never been able to keep to

124
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,639
time management

125
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,479
uh most of the time at hackathons you'll

126
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,479
find me passed out on my keyboard

127
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,040
or smashing out code in the last couple

128
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,720
of minutes trying to fix whatever the

129
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,759
hell we made

130
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,199
or when we suddenly decided to change

131
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,800
our mind

132
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,840
yeah that's about to say if you look at

133
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,320
it from post perspective is when we

134
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,400
destroy the entire project and rebuild

135
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,800
it 30 with 30 minutes left

136
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,240
hey we still tend to win with those

137
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,000
things so i'm not complaining

138
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,199
sure you also learnt

139
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,840
so oh sorry i think i moved on a bit too

140
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,199
soon lee there but we'll continue

141
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,240
with the with this uh this is a ctf that

142
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,639
me

143
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,960
and uh chloe took part in uh yeah so

144
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,680
we started off in separate teams so jen

145
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,600
was working with someone called james

146
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,720
and i was working with fleur and we

147
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,320
decided to merge groups because we

148
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,600
thought it would be better because we'd

149
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,400
have more people

150
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,360
and more ideas to go with how to solve

151
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,039
different things

152
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,960
so it started off with a link at the

153
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,320
bottom of the

154
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,039
challenge coin and when you went to the

155
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:27,840
link

156
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,320
it basically said this is not it must

157
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,919
try harder

158
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,520
so when we took a closer look at the

159
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,800
link itself we realized it was base64

160
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,240
so we used cyber chef to decrypt it

161
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,759
um and it decrypted to cyber so we went

162
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,440
to that address

163
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,639
yeah and this was quite a challenging

164
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,680
um ctf this i believe

165
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,680
hasn't been completed by anyone since

166
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,759
and we were the first to complete it

167
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,199
um this involved basically

168
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,919
six months of us being on discord with

169
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,759
each other every night

170
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,440
kind of until the early hours of the

171
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,280
morning going insane doing this

172
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,160
and when we were trying to collect all

173
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,880
the information to kind of tally up what

174
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,840
we had done for this we had to dig

175
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,319
through

176
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,000
months of insanity basically

177
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,039
um multiple group chats oh yeah on

178
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,240
different platforms

179
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,960
yeah we would hop platform every couple

180
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,800
of weeks for some reason

181
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,560
um but yeah a lot of this we learned

182
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,680
um over time and it was a lot of new

183
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,560
things

184
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,800
uh but we did use some interesting tools

185
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,080
uh which were these

186
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,120
um cyberchef which is a gchq

187
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,440
tool which is on github which was a

188
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,560
godsend

189
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,520
because genuinely going through all

190
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,680
these you had to decode and encode so

191
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,960
many different things

192
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,800
that it was really useful we also used

193
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,720
wireshark cleopatra john the ripper and

194
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,440
gim

195
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,639
now these tools are just

196
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,800
in relation to that ctf so if you're

197
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,759
looking for a general tool set for ctfs

198
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,080
it's very hard to build a general

199
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,880
toolset

200
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,199
because of the fact that they are each

201
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,919
ctf is kind of custom to whatever you're

202
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,560
doing in that ctf but these are just

203
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,240
some of the tools that we used

204
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,319
for the uh this ctf

205
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,800
and here's another ctf we did uh this is

206
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,400
the recon village

207
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,000
um ctf for defcon safe mode

208
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,720
yeah so this was me and jen's first time

209
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,479
ever competing on something that had

210
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,160
been arranged the defcon

211
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,080
and it was also our first time competing

212
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,840
on an ocean challenge

213
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,240
so we decided the best time to begin

214
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,400
this was the final day

215
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,160
just effectively managing our time

216
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,400
perfectly there so you can see like our

217
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,759
lovely little arrows

218
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,680
how late we started compared to everyone

219
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,599
else yet we managed to finish

220
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,319
10th which we were quite happy about and

221
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,080
this one was

222
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,520
one of my favorite ctfs that we've

223
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,440
actually done because

224
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,680
every single challenge was so different

225
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,039
from the last we had to use

226
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,840
so like a different range of tools and

227
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,360
methods to actually

228
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,440
get to the answers and it was like just

229
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,639
one giant puzzle

230
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,759
which is really quite entertaining to do

231
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,560
yeah and um for this ctf the tools we

232
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,160
used were the wayback machine

233
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,280
using metadata in images uh using social

234
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,560
media and google lens

235
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,400
and so the wayback machine was really

236
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,560
handy when we needed to find

237
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,319
information that was obviously no longer

238
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,000
there and if you know what the wayback

239
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,958
machine is basically

240
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,200
it it's a way to browse the internet

241
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,080
archive

242
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,839
uh so web pages are archived and you're

243
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,279
able to navigate through them choose

244
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,200
them by year sometimes dates sometimes

245
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,479
even hourly

246
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,560
uh which it's really useful for

247
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,040
specifically this hackathon

248
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,440
metadata was also uh quite valuable

249
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,560
because we were able to

250
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,800
look at where images were taken when

251
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,560
they were taken what type of devices and

252
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,839
stuff like that we're able to strip

253
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,440
a lot of information you'd be surprised

254
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,920
how much information is hidden within

255
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,640
a photograph

256
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,120
you've also then got um the social

257
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,640
people's social medias

258
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,120
a lot of people when you're trying to

259
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,480
find information on them

260
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,480
your actual target their facebook

261
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,519
account for example

262
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,519
might be like fort knox and completely

263
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,680
locked down so you can't

264
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,680
find anything on their account but

265
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,600
people's friends and stuff they can

266
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,160
often be

267
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,120
weak links so you might not find

268
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,720
anything on your target that their best

269
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,200
friend

270
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,040
may have been with them and tagged them

271
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,880
in an image and their account is set to

272
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,680
public

273
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,720
so you can find information on that

274
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,080
person so people need to remember

275
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,880
to like not always look directly at your

276
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,560
target but look at their network of

277
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,360
people around

278
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,720
them yeah and that's the thing like

279
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,560
working as a team especially in those

280
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,360
regards sometimes is brilliant because

281
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,839
you're while your head is like deep in

282
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,680
the weeds and you're trying to find this

283
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,200
information it's better to have someone

284
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,519
who

285
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,680
has more of a bird die view and can kind

286
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,640
of see where you're

287
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,680
getting lost so to say we've also got

288
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,519
google lens on there which we used quite

289
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,279
a bit during this hackathon

290
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,480
during the ctf sorry um and that's

291
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,360
because

292
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,920
google lens can find buildings from

293
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,279
google maps

294
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,880
it can scan through google maps database

295
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,560
and find a similar building if not the

296
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,600
same building

297
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,720
and my god was i i used i used to

298
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,040
try to locate some of these some of the

299
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,640
challenges were to locate

300
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,200
uh physical locations and then say who

301
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
took the photo of that location

302
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,680
so at the the way that we went about it

303
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,360
was to put it to google and google lens

304
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,959
showed us the location on google maps

305
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,079
and then we looked through the google

306
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:36,800
photos

307
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,320
of that location and found the

308
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,839
photographer through that and that was

309
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,839
just one of the challenges and

310
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,480
the challenges are quite broad so you

311
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,000
don't really

312
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
again we can give you the kind of

313
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,240
mindset and put you towards some tools

314
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,079
but the best way to do this is to

315
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,560
practice um

316
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,240
so here's some tools and techniques for

317
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,240
hackathons on the other side so we've

318
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,079
spoke a bit about cts here's some about

319
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,760
hackathons

320
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,160
for hackathons you really need to know

321
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,519
who your audience is

322
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,200
so if you're going to do a hackathon for

323
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,680
the police make some tools that you know

324
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,600
would help the police out

325
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,560
um if you're going to do it for the fire

326
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,120
service

327
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,880
maker tool that would help fire service

328
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,360
out success in hackathons

329
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,079
really comes down to collaboration and

330
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,040
uh targeting

331
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,800
so make sure the thing you're making

332
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,240
makes sense for the people you're making

333
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,120
it for

334
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,079
like um we went to a police hack and i

335
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,360
designed a

336
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,079
vr training tool so that was more

337
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,160
targeted at the police that it would be

338
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,360
you know a shop assistant let's say

339
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,440
and it makes more sense that you don't

340
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,200
make something broad you make something

341
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,880
targeted and then when you go

342
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,680
into presenting it you'll have a much

343
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,680
better idea what you're doing

344
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,480
collaboration you need to work with

345
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,240
other people at the hackathon

346
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,000
there are people who are going to be

347
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,920
much more intelligent and much more

348
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,720
skilled than you

349
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,440
there and it's best to speak to them and

350
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,480
learn from them

351
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,399
because there's not many situations you

352
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,000
get to be put in a room full of clever

353
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,040
people

354
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,200
and they're happy being asked questions

355
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,320
repeatedly

356
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,800
so use that to your advantage go and

357
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,480
talk to other people

358
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,360
and when you're doing hacks the thinking

359
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,040
outside the box as i put on the

360
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,480
powerpoint you really need to look at it

361
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,639
from a wide-angle view don't get too

362
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,320
bogged down at specifics if you come up

363
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,320
with an idea but you're not able to

364
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,000
complete it by the end of the hackathon

365
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,959
that's fine

366
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,760
just get a prototype working or get you

367
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,079
get

368
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,800
something together that shows that your

369
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,839
idea is useful

370
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,079
because then other people who may be

371
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,519
able to actually get that across the

372
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,200
line may come and talk to you and want

373
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,600
to build on that project you shouldn't

374
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,480
be dis

375
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,240
disheartened if you don't get something

376
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,079
working by the end of the

377
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,279
presentation because you that's not life

378
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,120
you don't always get the chance to get

379
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,760
it right

380
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,680
sometimes if you have a good enough idea

381
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,839
that still will count

382
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,399
and my favorite thing with hackathons is

383
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,240
that to experiment with new technology

384
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,000
sometimes people bring i know for a fact

385
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
i bring my vr headset so people can

386
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,399
try use that if people have technology

387
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,040
you want to try

388
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,880
ask them there's like the i've used the

389
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,079
leap camera

390
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,120
um some new raspberry pi bits that i've

391
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,959
never used before smoke detectors and

392
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:19,600
stuff

393
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,880
i once powered alexa off like 56

394
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,920
lemons and a potato so just

395
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,639
if you really want to experiment go wild

396
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,000
with it

397
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,279
so um from all that here's some things

398
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,279
that we've learned

399
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,920
um obviously time management we've

400
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,600
preached and that's because it is really

401
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,399
really

402
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,560
um important when you're at these events

403
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,839
because there's only a certain amount of

404
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,040
time that you have so you need to be

405
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,839
able to prioritize what you need to do

406
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,040
and

407
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,199
make sure you evenly distribute the

408
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,880
tasks so that everyone's helping out

409
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,079
and the events themselves

410
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,600
only have a set amount of time within

411
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,360
them so

412
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,120
say you've got 24 hours you need to make

413
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,880
sure that you've got something to show

414
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,240
at the end of it even if it's just a

415
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,040
presentation with an idea

416
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,760
yeah and uh team building the people

417
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,760
around you are as important

418
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,680
because you've got to remember you're

419
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,000
going to be together for in most cases

420
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,120
24 hours if not more sometimes and you

421
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,160
all have to work well together usually

422
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,120
with the with hackathons i will do i

423
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,560
will surround myself with people who are

424
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,680
non-technical

425
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,040
because they come up with the greatest

426
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,720
ideas they come up with ideas that are

427
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,800
so ludicrous so impossible

428
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,279
that they sound fantastic and you just

429
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,519
have to adapt those ideas into

430
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,720
a more technical position and i feel

431
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,199
like

432
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,720
once you've done a couple of hackathons

433
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,320
you'll start making technical friends

434
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,440
and you'll start making friends at

435
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,959
hackathons for example chloe we better

436
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,800
and then you'll start working together

437
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,880
and when me and chloe go taxathons now

438
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,240
we know each other's strengths and

439
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,240
deficits so we know

440
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,399
exactly what tasks we can dole out and

441
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,279
that helps with the

442
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,440
time management side of things as well

443
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,120
because you know who's good at what and

444
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,480
who you can delegate to who

445
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,560
yep and also at cts and hackathons

446
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,880
like it's completely fine to ask

447
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,760
questions because

448
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,199
you're not going to be the smartest

449
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,519
person in the room no one is

450
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,160
and so if you don't know how to do

451
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,839
something chances are there's another

452
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,760
person in the room that does snow

453
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,839
and in this community a lot of people

454
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,519
are just super helpful

455
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,759
so if you don't know how to do something

456
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,519
chances are they'll show you how to do

457
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,680
it if you just go up to them and ask

458
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,240
and but also especially on things like

459
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,040
ocean

460
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,279
you've got to think how the person

461
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,120
you're trying to find

462
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,639
actually is thinking so i you got to get

463
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,399
into their frame of mind and ask

464
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,320
questions how they would be thinking

465
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,759
yeah it's it again it's about

466
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,199
reaching out and trying to collaborate

467
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,120
with people there are people out there

468
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,759
who are waiting for you to like reach

469
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:02,880
out and

470
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,519
learn from them so to say a lot of these

471
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,639
places will have an

472
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,680
expert or someone who let's see for the

473
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,880
police one there were police officers

474
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,639
there we could speak to

475
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,680
who would know about the specific

476
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,040
thing we're building and you had

477
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,360
responses as well yeah

478
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,240
because they'd help out yeah exactly and

479
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,600
these companies who

480
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,800
reach out to um help these hackathons

481
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,600
and ctfs

482
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,920
will send people that you can talk to

483
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,599
who are more than happy to help you out

484
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,360
so um here's here's some information if

485
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,560
you want to up skill

486
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,160
and want to actually learn some of the

487
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,600
stuff we've been talking about

488
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,959
so one of the places you could do that

489
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,959
is hack the box um

490
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,079
hack the box is a free website um

491
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,600
you will have to hack into it to get an

492
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,279
account but trust me there's

493
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,040
a million tutorials on how to get an

494
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,480
account but once you are in

495
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,519
um there are campaigns to take you

496
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,240
through

497
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,399
each step of stuff we've been talking

498
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,480
about to teach you how to do ctfs

499
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,880
it'll teach you the mindset to have for

500
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,839
hackathons

501
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,480
and will really train you in the way of

502
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,439
thinking for this

503
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,959
and there is also yes so

504
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,039
immersive labs is really good for

505
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,240
teaching you things

506
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,599
from the complete basics so they've got

507
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,079
like paths that you can take from things

508
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,480
on like linux command line and operating

509
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,199
systems

510
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,039
to also show you how to use popular

511
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,720
tools like wireshark

512
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,799
nmap and also how to do things like

513
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,480
encoding and encryption

514
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,039
but unfortunately it is a paid-for thing

515
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,559
that's like me and chloe get it

516
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,760
from our university

517
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,840
yeah so the university provides it for

518
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,840
us and it's really good because

519
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,320
it starts from the very basics so the

520
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,640
basic tasks that you complete

521
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,640
are worth less points and it will slowly

522
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,760
build you up to doing

523
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,640
more complex things um and you get more

524
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,799
points for however hard the tasks are

525
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,559
but it covers from defensive to um

526
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,640
attack and it it covers everything that

527
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,480
you could basically need

528
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,600
and to be fair most ctfs are laid out

529
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,240
like that

530
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,640
they will have easy tasks which are

531
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,240
worth less points and

532
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,280
hard tasks which are worth more and uh

533
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,120
it's a good way of training for them

534
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,200
because you'll sort of already be in

535
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,720
that mindset of you know

536
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,240
you're able to get the easy points and

537
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,400
the hard points you spend a little less

538
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,840
time on the easy ones and more time on

539
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,960
the hard ones

540
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,400
right okay oh wrong slide oh okay

541
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,640
and uh that is the end of our

542
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,679
presentation

543
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,120
um these are where you can find us um

544
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,480
i've got my website there we've got

545
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,480
twitter handles and if you have any

546
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,640
questions feel free to ask

547
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,880
okay thank you very much indeed chloe

548
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,679
charlie jen

549
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,840
brilliant stuff there we did get one

550
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,039
question which you've

551
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,320
kind of answered but i'm going to ask it

552
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,320
again um and it does get asked a lot

553
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,160
when people talk about hackathons and

554
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,760
ctf programs is there any advice for

555
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,520
non-techie noobs

556
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,520
um around getting into these kind of

557
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,720
activities

558
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,919
yeah so um my partner is

559
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,120
a lawyer now and it's not a it's not

560
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,120
technical in the slightest

561
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,039
and she when she comes along to

562
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,640
hackathons

563
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,760
i find it easier um and she's spoken to

564
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,640
me about this because

565
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,360
i've spoken to her about it it's if you

566
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:21,760
go

567
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,080
and fight so if you're going on your own

568
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,440
let's say you're non-technical you go on

569
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,000
your own

570
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,760
find a group of someone who's technical

571
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,280
who is

572
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,600
most that is willing to explain things

573
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,559
to you

574
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,720
so um most of the time when you go to

575
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,200
hackathons there will be somebody there

576
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,919
who is willing to explain to you what's

577
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:40,720
going on

578
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,440
and honestly you being non-technical you

579
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,160
are a

580
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,799
absolute like you are gold to people

581
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:47,200
because

582
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,120
as i said earlier you come up with ideas

583
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,360
that no technical person will think of

584
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,720
because there'll be things that techno

585
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,480
people will think of that will they'll

586
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,360
just

587
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,440
strike out because it's you know it's

588
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,640
too easy or something

589
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,240
but non-technical people come up with a

590
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,559
lot better ideas

591
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,640
i guess it's that that notion that you

592
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,080
described jen about not

593
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,440
you don't need to be technical to be

594
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,880
able to think out the box and thinking

595
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,480
out the box is exactly how you succeed

596
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,600
with these things yeah

597
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,559
um before sean's going to make a comment

598
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,240
about immersive labs in a sec but

599
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,760
i've got another question from the um

600
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,520
from the twitch

601
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,679
it's to all three of you really so which

602
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:22,960
type of challenges

603
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,799
are your favorites so we'll start with

604
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,400
chloe

605
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,760
um i like the web

606
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,600
web ones where you're doing stuff with

607
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,039
the um

608
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,039
javascript and everything on the actual

609
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,320
sites itself

610
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,200
yep cool that's my area of the world i

611
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,720
like that stuff too

612
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,520
um charlie what about you i like oceans

613
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,640
a lot because

614
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,039
i like always like a massive puzzle so

615
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,320
you go down like this little rabbit hole

616
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,240
just to try and find the answers like

617
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,440
where has this person

618
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,799
been or what were they doing at this

619
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,760
place at this date or time

620
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,960
yeah brilliant jen yeah my what's going

621
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,320
to be hosted as well but i might as well

622
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,520
say something different

623
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,440
uh steganography uh that was something

624
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,440
that we uh had to deal with

625
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,880
uh during the csv challenge coin

626
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,080
um and you find that finding stuff

627
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,440
hidden within other stuff

628
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,919
it's really quite interesting to me like

629
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,760
finding qr codes hidden in the most

630
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,039
random places

631
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,240
like stuff like that really um

632
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,240
i don't know i really like breaking that

633
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,240
down and kind of seeing how it works

634
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,960
yeah brilliant um another question we've

635
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,440
gotten

636
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,760
they're flying in um what was your

637
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,840
fondest memory of the csv

638
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,360
coin challenge and why um

639
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,720
i i i think it was a team aspect

640
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,480
yeah uh the 9010

641
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,280
i i wouldn't have continued with this if

642
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,880
it wasn't for my teammates

643
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,760
uh we had someone join our team who left

644
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,320
after

645
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,400
a day who was like you're not taking

646
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,880
this serious enough you know you're all

647
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,640
just making jokes and laughing

648
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,559
and the funny thing was uh we actually

649
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,559
completed it a month later

650
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,559
so fair enough fair enough

651
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,840
during these interesting times um that's

652
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,159
all i'm going to say about the times

653
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,280
um are you finding it more difficult to

654
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:17,919
engage

655
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,400
and collaborate on ctfs because you're

656
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,840
all remote from each other or has it not

657
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,799
really made any difference

658
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,799
i don't think it's made any difference

659
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,880
no because like with defcon as well

660
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,120
we just kind of went on took a call with

661
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,640
each other on discord

662
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,400
and would have it on like group chats

663
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,360
if anything it's made it easier yes i i

664
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,520
think for us who are very socially

665
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,400
awkward who

666
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,240
you know your citizen aruba will take 20

667
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,240
minutes to acclimatize to the room

668
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,240
you let us sit in our own rooms we get

669
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,120
we're a lot more efficient

670
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,960
and also you can attend more events and

671
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,960
things because they've been made online

672
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,400
rather than you having to actually go to

673
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,360
the place

674
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,840
yeah eg def con yeah none of us have

675
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,039
been to defcon before

676
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,799
and we went from not going to defcon to

677
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,880
be coming 10th place in a ctf for once

678
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,679
so

679
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,880
yeah that's a brilliant response um

680
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,360
i think that's all the questions i've

681
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,559
just got

682
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,640
another one and then sean can do his

683
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,240
little immersive labs pitch

684
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,440
because we have got a little bit of time

685
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,240
left what sort of careers

686
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,240
do you see people going into

687
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,760
from on the back of i guess the

688
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,120
experience the game from things like

689
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,720
ctfs and hackathons

690
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,039
um and obviously if you're already in a

691
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:31,919
career

692
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,600
then you can't you're going in the

693
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,280
opposite direction i guess but

694
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,640
what sort of outcomes you talk about

695
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,320
ocean well that's great for you know

696
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:38,960
things like

697
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,799
working law enforcement intelligence you

698
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,799
know we we had a great

699
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,760
session the other day um where we saw

700
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,960
some really

701
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,640
serious application reversing around

702
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,240
protecting children and all that kind of

703
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,440
stuff and that's a really

704
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,440
laudable and incredibly important piece

705
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,360
of work but what sort of jobs can people

706
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,640
get from doing this stuff that's the

707
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,679
simplest way i can put it

708
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,600
um i i think that it would help out most

709
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,400
jobs

710
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,000
um i i think if you're looking at

711
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,679
technical jobs you've obviously got

712
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:08,480
threatened uh

713
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,679
threat intel analysis you've got a pen

714
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:12,799
test in there

715
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,960
two roles that are heavily

716
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,919
problem-solving

717
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,760
and like trying to get information out

718
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,080
of what you've got in front of you

719
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,080
well i think that it could help anyone

720
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,000
in any role because it's one of those

721
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,799
things where

722
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,080
you're going to be better at problem

723
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,240
solving you know communication and

724
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,520
teamwork you're going to be thinking

725
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,400
outside the box

726
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,240
i can't see a job role that that

727
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,320
wouldn't help with really

728
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,400
but from the technical side the ones

729
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,480
i've mentioned i think are great

730
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,799
routes to go into with what you've got

731
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:41,520
because

732
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,320
you're already from hackathons and ctfs

733
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,400
being that mindset to want to be

734
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,000
you know trying to solve puzzles and

735
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
trying to make things to help people

736
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,039
yeah i think also um with hackathons and

737
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,880
things that there's also the software

738
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,679
developer side of it as well yeah of

739
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:58,159
course

740
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,159
of course all right brilliant thank you

741
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:01,760
for that um sean did you just want to

742
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,679
make a quick point

743
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,880
uh i actually had a question first um so

744
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,440
i'm

745
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,039
absolutely horrible at ctfs um i

746
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,120
would assume that there are some people

747
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,960
out there who are like me just

748
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,240
for whatever reasons just can't do it um

749
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,400
face problems with it what are your

750
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,440
recommendations

751
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,200
uh for people like myself

752
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,679
practice yeah practice and

753
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,600
yeah the more you do the more you'll

754
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,039
learn um i was

755
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,600
absolutely terrible in my first ctf i

756
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,640
got

757
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,880
like i think it was 50 points which was

758
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,159
one task

759
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,440
um and then by the time i got to the

760
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,159
defcon one i had done maybe three and we

761
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,320
became tenth so it really is

762
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,880
about doing and doing it doing and if

763
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,480
you're scared about doing one and not

764
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,600
doing very well

765
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,200
don't be that's the main thing you've

766
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,120
got to kind of overcome is you're going

767
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,640
to fail at some points and you're not

768
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,840
going to be the best

769
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,760
you just need to do and if you look out

770
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,559
there there's basically ctfs running

771
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,000
throughout the year at all times you

772
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,520
don't need to go to a defcon one you

773
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,559
don't need to go to

774
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,520
you know a specific one look online and

775
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,039
just take part in them

776
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,159
never get discouraged because you don't

777
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,840
know how to do something because the

778
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,279
only way you're going to learn is by

779
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,480
doing it

780
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,960
exactly and if if you're sitting there

781
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,960
going well i don't think i can do that

782
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,640
so i'm not gonna try well if you don't

783
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,559
try you're not gonna learn how to do it

784
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,960
so you're not gonna progress

785
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,919
yeah the excellent great points and uh

786
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,520
it is certainly something that i've been

787
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,960
trying to work on so

788
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,159
myself because i'm terrible so totally

789
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,720
agree with what you have to say um just

790
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,240
a point on immersive labs

791
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,960
uh so there is a community mode now um

792
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,720
that is open to everyone

793
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,279
it's not all the labs um but there are a

794
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,039
bunch of labs there so

795
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,679
uh i would encourage people to have a

796
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:54,720
look at that

797
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,440
yep brilliant thanks uh ian you've got a

798
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,400
quick question

799
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,080
yeah just um super quick um do you feel

800
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,760
that uh having like ctfs and

801
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,400
are good for resumes or is it something

802
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,600
that you'd say

803
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,919
talk about in a job interview just sort

804
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,200
of wondering how

805
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,240
um ctfs might sort of add

806
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,480
some distinguishing characteristics for

807
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,320
people just starting out

808
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,559
i think it shows that um you're actually

809
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,720
interested in the subjects and it also

810
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,200
look good depending on how you've come

811
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,880
and everything because it shows that

812
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,080
you're actually getting involved in the

813
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,000
community and that you're taking part in

814
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,279
something

815
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,520
yeah and for me i've been in uh

816
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,480
interviews where

817
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,559
i maybe not have put it on my cv but

818
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,240
i've put it on my website

819
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,080
uh and we've spoken about it uh in a

820
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,159
more because you tend to do the formal

821
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:47,039
interview and then have a little

822
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,799
conversation that's where i usually

823
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,000
mention it because

824
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,520
it if you're talking to a technical

825
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,360
person they will be interested about it

826
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,440
but if you're talking to a hr person

827
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,799
i'm not entirely sure they're going to

828
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,039
understand what a ctf is

829
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,640
so i think it's really about gauging

830
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,840
your audience in that regard

831
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,720
great stuff thank you awesome okay well

832
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,799
we're just about running to time so

833
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,120
fabulous stuff um i just want to thank

834
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,679
