1
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:05,120
all right welcome back

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,480
everybody um we've got our first talk

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,519
of the event coming up right now uh zach

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,360
and he's going to be talking about uh

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,040
dungeons and dragons and devops in the

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,880
context of information security so

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,960
welcome zach over to you thank you all

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,000
right good morning everybody

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,760
um i'm here today to talk about

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,600
something a little bit different

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,920
i want to talk about working differently

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,560
through fancy role playing

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,439
so almost six years ago i found myself

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,280
in a field in the middle of nowhere

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,920
uh with about a thousand other people

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,480
and

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,239
like many others i was smearing face

18
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,160
paint that was now dripping into my eyes

19
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,239
mixed with sweat and i was clad in this

20
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,000
latex mask that was sat

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,239
uncomfortably tight to my face as well

22
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,160
as heavy leather armor that restricted

23
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,600
my breathing

24
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,600
i was about to be thrust into a small

25
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,360
circular pit marked out with wooden

26
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,280
stakes in order to fight another person

27
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,199
to prove my worth

28
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,160
this was me well sort of it was me

29
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,719
playing

30
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,600
a role that i'd created in that moment i

31
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,479
was ico

32
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,240
an orc who had just come to the fantasy

33
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,000
city of anvil and

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,479
for the first time just like ico i'd

35
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,320
come to a larp

36
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,000
so it's probably best if i briefly

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,320
explain what larp is

38
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,640
it's an acronym for live action role

39
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,759
play

40
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,920
uh live action role play is a hobby that

41
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,200
has hundreds of thousands of

42
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,960
participants across the globe

43
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,720
it's a particular passion of mine then

44
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,560
it has been since the first moment i put

45
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,680
on that mask

46
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,439
and the hobby is made up of various

47
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,119
events so some of these are run every

48
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,720
weekend on a particular day

49
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,159
some of them take up whole weekends and

50
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,920
they run quarterly or similar

51
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,079
and some like the event that i run only

52
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,840
run once a year

53
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,520
now in each of these events is a

54
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,920
different world a world constructed by

55
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,759
a game manager who writes the story and

56
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,360
the law behind the world and

57
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,159
how it works similar to how jrr tolkien

58
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,240
built the world of middle earth

59
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,000
and they also write a set of rules that

60
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,520
take into account things like

61
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,479
combat uh using magic and how players

62
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,840
interact with the world that's been

63
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,719
built

64
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,399
it's then up to the players to create a

65
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:05,920
character within that world

66
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,920
and play out a story that they want to

67
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,318
see as well as experience the story that

68
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,040
the game manager has written

69
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,879
a lot doesn't have to be just medieval

70
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,000
fantasy though it can be any genre like

71
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,400
post-apocalyptic or

72
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,800
science fiction or even just modern day

73
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,160
and there's a large event to suit

74
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,400
every taste and everyone is catered to

75
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,040
no matter what their background

76
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,480
but the key features that i want to

77
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,400
focus on a lot from today is

78
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,080
taking on the role of a character so

79
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,840
putting yourself in someone else's shoes

80
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,319
and

81
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,920
acting differently and the path to

82
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,760
empathy that provides

83
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,920
uh interacting with a created world

84
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,680
improvising around a set of rules and

85
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,720
scenarios

86
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,800
and the flexibility that brings

87
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,840
appearing to

88
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,360
the rules but bringing your own

89
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,879
contributions

90
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,280
and finally creating a collaborative

91
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,920
story

92
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,599
working with others to create an outcome

93
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,280
that everyone can enjoy

94
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,879
have contributed to and feel proud of

95
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,120
so what does this have to do with

96
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,239
infosec

97
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,959
well i believe we can use larp as a

98
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,959
framework for better working

99
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,879
i've broken this down into typical role

100
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,480
play quests so

101
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,680
let's take a look at what quest we've

102
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,159
got so first off we have fail safely we

103
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,840
need to learn how to make educational

104
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,879
mistakes in a safety critical industry

105
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,879
plan for risk use lessons learned and

106
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,200
invest in skills like crisis management

107
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,879
and finally foster a supportive

108
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,280
community creating genuine connections

109
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,879
between employees and encouraging

110
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:29,840
support across

111
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,720
all levels so let's start with our first

112
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,519
quest

113
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,640
fail safely now in

114
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,040
larp when your character dies it's sad

115
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,080
but it's not lethal

116
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,920
you don't actually die for real though

117
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,599
i've seen some fairly immersive games

118
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,280
where you might come close

119
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,280
but ultimately if your character dies

120
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,879
you just make a new one

121
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,640
and further to that in some larps you

122
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,640
can have spells that let you divine

123
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,400
threats and hidden enemies or

124
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,400
let you run a simulation of a situation

125
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,599
before it goes ahead

126
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,200
essentially giving your group a second

127
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,760
go at the encounter

128
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,280
but the biggest problem in high-stakes

129
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,959
industries like information security is

130
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:05,439
that

131
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,560
if you fail that's it you could lose

132
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,519
your job and

133
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:10,799
essentially be blacklisted from the

134
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,799
industry and that's just on a personal

135
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:13,360
level

136
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,040
the impact of a security failure to an

137
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,839
organization can have drastic effects

138
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,759
this isn't a healthy way to work and one

139
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,358
of the most effective ways to learn is

140
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,320
by failing

141
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,840
and making mistakes and you gain

142
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,160
valuable experience from that

143
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,479
so how do we deal with that well we can

144
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:29,919
certainly take the usual steps such as

145
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,680
training and consultancy and threat

146
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,560
modeling

147
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,720
but these measures are usually placed in

148
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,639
a firmly theoretical space and aimed

149
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:37,120
more

150
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,080
organizational level changes but i think

151
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,240
we can use role-playing and war games to

152
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,759
give staff for all levels

153
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,080
a threat that needs to be dealt with by

154
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,840
establishing a credible scenario

155
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,120
and getting employees to act how they

156
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,199
would in a real environment we can see

157
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,400
areas for improvement

158
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,479
and learning and potential choke points

159
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:55,840
it's an opportunity to learn from

160
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,040
mistakes

161
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,919
and emphasize where your organization

162
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:00,800
excels

163
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,160
and beyond this it also gives your staff

164
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,919
a chance to shine with outside the box

165
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,600
thinking and they can bring their own

166
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,720
experiences

167
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,479
and their own contributions so

168
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,560
that's our first quest failing safely

169
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,240
now let's have a look at planning for

170
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,440
risk

171
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,280
i mentioned during failing safely that

172
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,680
sometimes in larp characters can use a

173
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,320
spell

174
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,600
that lets them run a simulation of an

175
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,759
encounter

176
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:24,960
and what that means is they'll be able

177
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,560
to fight any enemies that are up ahead

178
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,160
and find out what the threats are what

179
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,840
spells they might have or any hidden

180
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,800
traps

181
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,160
and after they've defined that they can

182
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,080
prepare accordingly and they can choose

183
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,919
which potions to take or what battle

184
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,440
formation to pick

185
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,360
and this is where failing safely works

186
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,680
so well we know that the mage got taken

187
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,520
out by an orc berserker so they can

188
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,919
reposition that mage to a safer location

189
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,600
maybe give them a healing potion or some

190
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,280
more armor

191
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,120
once your scenario or your war game

192
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,560
issue has been dealt with

193
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,479
or worst case it hasn't been dealt with

194
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,080
then it's important to gather all the

195
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,360
participants together

196
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,919
to review lessons learned any mistakes

197
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:00,880
that were made

198
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,319
it's the same principle look where

199
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,319
people failed or where they absolutely

200
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,680
knocked out the park

201
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,199
where were people's strong points should

202
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,280
people be repositioned you need to look

203
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,120
at this both from an employee point of

204
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,520
view

205
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,759
gathering self-reflection opinions and

206
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,800
ideas

207
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,800
but um also from a data point of view so

208
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,560
how long did it take to respond the

209
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,840
measure of the threat's impact if you

210
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,280
can measure it

211
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,520
now in larp nothing holds your crisis

212
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,960
management skills like 50 people

213
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,639
charging towards you armed with spears

214
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,960
and swords and all sorts of weaponry

215
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,039
in security it's absolutely vital that

216
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,000
we implement robust

217
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,600
crisis management plans and these

218
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,039
scenarios are perfect

219
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,720
for informing the decisions that you put

220
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,080
into these plans

221
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,600
when i mentioned before about reviewing

222
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,520
the scenarios and repositioning people

223
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,919
this is absolutely the place to do that

224
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:46,880
was there someone who stayed

225
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,479
particularly calm and took charge of the

226
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,280
situation

227
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,599
maybe someone who rose above the station

228
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,280
and make sure these people are utilizing

229
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,120
your crisis management plans as valuable

230
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,800
assets

231
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,199
now finally the key advantage here is

232
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,319
empathy

233
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,160
in larp you are literally putting

234
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,000
yourself in someone else's albeit

235
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,680
fictional shoes

236
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,520
when we instill empathetic ways of

237
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,360
thinking into our risk management it

238
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,520
allows us to understand both the who

239
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,599
and the why behind potential threats but

240
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,360
also understand the impact at all levels

241
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,240
from customer

242
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,639
to upper management when threat

243
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,400
modelling go beyond your standardized

244
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,919
templates and really think about who

245
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,599
would want to perform these attacks

246
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,960
and why so that's our second question we

247
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,440
failed safely and we planned for risk

248
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,440
so finally i want to cover our last

249
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,560
quest fostering a supportive community

250
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,039
now one of my favorite things about larp

251
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,479
is the community

252
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,720
the hobby brings people from all walks

253
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,400
of life together to enjoy this

254
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,520
collaborative

255
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,080
and cooperative experience now i think

256
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,840
there's a strong case for mirroring this

257
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,960
at work

258
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,479
the first thing i want to talk about is

259
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,240
genuine connections

260
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,680
now i'm sure most of us here have

261
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,840
attended training with toe curling

262
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,280
icebreakers where

263
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,960
we have to tell each other three facts

264
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,800
or some other such trivial bits and bobs

265
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,360
that we've all

266
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,919
forgotten by the time we hope t but the

267
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,840
thing is particularly in industries like

268
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,400
it

269
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,879
and infosec people are drawn to rules

270
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,800
because they're passionate about them

271
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,080
and that's how we should be connecting

272
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,520
people through a shared passion to

273
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,039
deliver high standards

274
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,840
high protection and high quality instead

275
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,080
of learning how many cats steve has

276
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,800
what's steve's most pressing concern in

277
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,400
security trends at the moment

278
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,080
what's been the most difficult situation

279
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,440
how did they overcome it what's the

280
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,039
proudest achievement

281
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,039
we are passionate people and we should

282
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,559
at every point share that passion with

283
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,479
each other

284
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,440
now in larp mental health issues are

285
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,559
endemic

286
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,320
but the beauty of the community is that

287
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,240
because so many of us have faced those

288
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,200
experience

289
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,800
and we've learned from about them from

290
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,959
others we're all available as a massive

291
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,320
support network

292
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,600
and i think this is something that more

293
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,440
organizations need to adopt

294
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,440
supporting mental health can't just be a

295
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,040
buzzword and telling people it's mental

296
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,279
health awareness day in a newsletter

297
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,200
we need to move past managers saying

298
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,640
okay we'll take a sick day and get back

299
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,720
in tomorrow with exasperation

300
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,720
now recently mental health first aider

301
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,240
courses have been popping up and i see

302
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,240
it as an absolute key investment

303
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,920
for managers and just beyond these

304
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,920
courses just encouraging more awareness

305
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,360
of mental health at all levels

306
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,200
and checking in with others and making

307
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,640
sure that employees feel like they can

308
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,240
share issues if they want to

309
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,760
in an environment where they won't be

310
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,440
punished or kept on watch for

311
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,000
performance

312
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,240
issues and that goes hand in hand with

313
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,760
my final point

314
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,160
understand your employees people often

315
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,680
have a wealth of untapped potential from

316
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,200
their hobbies and their home life

317
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,040
i spend a lot of time making 3d art and

318
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,640
videos outside of work

319
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,080
and i've been given the chance to use

320
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,519
those skills help create training

321
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,240
materials for staff in my full-time role

322
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,760
it's really engaging for me as an

323
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,839
employee to use skills i have elsewhere

324
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:44,720
in my job

325
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,640
and it's a benefit to the workplace that

326
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,920
they get to use the results of those

327
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,640
skills

328
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,160
because it makes me feel valued because

329
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,320
what i do in my spare time is valued

330
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,640
i'm valued as a person not just as an

331
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,399
output source

332
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,480
so that's our three quests we've covered

333
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,240
failing safely using role play

334
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,320
planning for risk and using crisis

335
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,279
management

336
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,120
and we've discussed how to foster a

337
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,920
supportive work community

338
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,839
now in most laps when you complete a

339
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,920
quest you get gold or jewels or some

340
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,360
form of currency

341
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,480
unfortunately i can't offer you that

342
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,880
today but what we can see

343
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,399
is the rewards that a lot of way of

344
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,399
thinking could bring you staff

345
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,320
who are empathetic to the stakeholder

346
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,160
needs and to the potential threats to a

347
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,120
company

348
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,800
who are practiced in specific and

349
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,640
relevant crisis scenarios knowing

350
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,040
exactly what to do when issues strike

351
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,880
who are supportive of each other and

352
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,720
come together to solve

353
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,800
problems in the office and be there for

354
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,720
those with problems outside the office

355
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,800
who are mentally healthy and productive

356
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,920
thanks to practical

357
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,839
and legitimate support from the managers

358
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,760
and their wider organizations

359
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,399
and finally the reward is a strong

360
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,640
unique and effective way of training

361
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,560
for preparing for risk with a new and

362
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,359
interesting model

363
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,600
so that's everything for me today i just

364
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,120
wanted to say a few thanks in particular

365
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,480
to the beer farmers for giving me

366
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,959
the chance to talk and how about this

367
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:03,920
chance of speaking

368
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,440
to you all listening thanks for giving

369
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,120
me your time and i particularly like to

370
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,720
thank james bohr for suggesting that i

371
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,320
take up this opportunity and generally

372
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,839
for being an incredibly supportive

373
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:12,480
friend

374
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,959
in my career and my hobbies i'm going to

375
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,160
throw up some links to my contact

376
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:16,800
information

377
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,160
some of the things i've talked about as

378
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,079
well as some uh some shout outs

379
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,839
and i'd be happy to take any questions

380
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,760
okay thank you very much zach that was

381
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,040
absolutely fascinating

382
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,600
and the feedback that we've had in the

383
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,959
in the twitch has been

384
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,160
overwhelmingly uh positive

385
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,480
about your talk and i think there's

386
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,839
something in there for everybody

387
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,440
and it's a really important bunch of

388
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,959
messages that you've shared

389
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,519
um if we'll just keep an eye on the on

390
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,880
the twitch to see if anybody's got any

391
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,240
questions for us

392
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,040
um give that a couple of seconds just a

393
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,000
quick question for me

394
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,760
actually zach so what is it you actually

395
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,760
what's what's your job what do you do

396
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,680
uh so at the moment i work for a local

397
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,040
authority um

398
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,120
i am a digital and technical solutions

399
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,880
graduate so basically looking at

400
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,240
different areas in the business and

401
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,240
seeing where we can kind of um

402
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,079
maybe improve processes to give better

403
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,720
value and to help people

404
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,680
um so it's kind of been a um they've

405
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,200
kind of been putting me through uni

406
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,440
so uh i've been sort of bouncing around

407
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,800
every single department within our

408
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,000
technology can change

409
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,120
there's been a really you know

410
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,560
eye-opening experience considering

411
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,920
they're kind of taking me from

412
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,360
zero experience to someone who can

413
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,360
actually input into the team it's been

414
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,320
been really good excellent there has

415
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,760
been a question what makes a good

416
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,880
scenario

417
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,760
what makes a good scenario of the

418
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,680
context of our world

419
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,680
so i think there's things to consider is

420
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,040
the context of

421
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,680
um what the company is what you provide

422
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,279
and what your most kind of credible

423
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,800
threats are going to be

424
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,959
um but also looking at who's involved in

425
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,079
it so

426
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,839
if you know your employees how can you

427
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,600
challenge them and how can you present

428
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,279
particular problems that

429
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,600
they might have to struggle a little bit

430
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,480
to overcome

431
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,160
but in the end kind of develop that

432
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,079
understanding and new skills

433
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,639
awesome awesome zach i really enjoyed

434
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,680
your talk a lot

435
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,480
you know lots in common i do have a

436
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,920
question for you though

437
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,519
um i think one of the things you spoke

438
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,200
about was you know working with

439
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,079
different people

440
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,880
and stuff like that uh collaboratively

441
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,600
which is

442
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,639
i think you know a really outside

443
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,920
the traditional sort of siloed um

444
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,639
version of it and i t security that we

445
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,320
see a lot of times do you want to do you

446
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:28,720
have any

447
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,399
sort of comments you want to expand on

448
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,399
that just a little bit love the talk by

449
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:32,959
the way

450
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,240
yeah so um thanks very much um

451
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,079
i think to be honest that is one thing

452
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,680
that needs to be pushed is that

453
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,040
collaborative working

454
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,680
not just between each other in an it

455
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,120
environment but also between

456
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,720
it and the rest of of kind of that

457
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,199
um structure because i think a lot of

458
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,880
the time people are sort of maybe a bit

459
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,240
intimidated by

460
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,800
uh more technical roles and actually i

461
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,760
think there's there's definitely

462
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,199
something to be said for

463
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,440
giving people who work in non-technical

464
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,079
roles at least a baseline understanding

465
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,639
as well as kind of supporting more

466
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:07,600
technical roles

467
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,199
in gaining those empathy skills and

468
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,720
being able to relate to people

469
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,480
no matter what their technical level is

470
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,600
or what their past experience might be

471
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,760
great another question from the twitch

472
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,720
um

473
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,720
the presentation was fascinating and i

474
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,480
think everybody everyone in the twitch

475
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,240
is saying exactly the same thing

476
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,600
what your thoughts on how you get this

477
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,199
message over to management in the

478
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,800
organization

479
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,720
that's that is a difficult one um

480
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,399
because i think particularly in

481
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,320
some organizations there's a reluctance

482
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,639
to change especially with

483
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,320
i think actually one of the big problems

484
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,920
really is that there's a lot of kind of

485
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,199
management fads

486
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,120
and people pick up these kind of trends

487
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,480
and then drop them quickly

488
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,720
because they don't have longevity but

489
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,839
actually

490
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,680
i think with with this kind of approach

491
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,440
with scenario based approached is that

492
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,440
it's up to the managers to kind of

493
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,199
develop it themselves and and kind of

494
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,480
have their own input

495
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,480
so i think there's less kind of onus on

496
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,240
being uh um

497
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,079
you know like a basically a an infosec

498
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,680
meme and more about

499
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,000
um encouraging people to input their own

500
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,760
stuff and i think that's what gives it

501
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,639
more longevity

502
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,480
great fantastic all right i think

503
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,320
that's about it in terms of the

504
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,600
questions um

505
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,199
again i want to say thanks very much

506
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,600
thank you kat vanesa being the first up

507
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,600
um but you actu absolutely smashed it

508
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,279
out the park so congratulations with

509
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,880
that and um

510
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,720
we'll take a little break and then we'll

511

be back up around about 10 10 o'clock
