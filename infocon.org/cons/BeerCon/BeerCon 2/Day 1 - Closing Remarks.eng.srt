1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:04,720
all right

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,680
so that is the end of day one of what

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,320
we've done

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,519
bircon 2 rise of the rookie um

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,440
i think it's fair to say it's been a

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,880
magnificent day

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,240
of superb speakers that have

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,400
found the bravery to come along and

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,080
share their adventures with us

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,840
i think scott you may have more recent

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,199
numbers but i believe

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,359
we had a rough number of 1050

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,558
unique visitors today across the day

14
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,160
upwards of that have you got have you

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,760
got a fresher number

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,879
uh 1079

17
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:44,640
1079 unique visitors so

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,360

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,760
from the speakers that we had during the

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,039
day so that's

23
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,800

25
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,359
a similar number if not more so we'll

26
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,480
probably end the evening

27
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,319
