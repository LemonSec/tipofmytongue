i'm going to be talking about fishing

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,879
and the state of fishing

18
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,120
how it works and where it comes from

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,079
so who am i i am a security researcher

20
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:48,480
for

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,199
scijacks we work in cyber threat

22
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,160
intelligence

23
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,719
and i sort of specialize in ocean and

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,480
maori analysis

25
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,719
and you can reach me on twitter at the

26
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,640
cheetah token like my own blog

27
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,399
i'm moderator on the on the money hats

28
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,680
club and i uh

29
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,879
take part in cti league

30
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,200
so i thought i'd just start with you

31
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,960
know the classic phishing email that i

32
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,680
received

33
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,360
yesterday evening um you know everyone

34
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,799
knows what a phishing email looks like

35
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,119
but i thought i would just share

36
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,200
just to you know familiarize everyone

37
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,520
with what the most common types of

38
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,080
attacks that people are receiving um as

39
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,720
you can see

40
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,439
it comes with it's sent from service at

41
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,320
paypal

42
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,880
and it has like two steps until it takes

43
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,000
your credentials

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,720
each page has got a certificate and

45
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,200
there's no warning signs on iphone

46
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,119
like there's no google safe browsing to

47
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,560
block it so

48
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,479
as you can as you can imagine lots of

49
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,600
people fall for this

50
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,119
i've received this one probably about

51
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,759
five times

52
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,920
so the state of fishing that we're

53
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,040
seeing at the moment

54
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,680
um includes multiple areas that i'm

55
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,040
going to cover in this talk

56
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,200
i'm going to talk about leveraging the

57
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,040
cloud

58
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,399
mass credential harvesting capturing 2fa

59
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,959
and all the other types of areas and

60
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:09,840
that

61
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,200
encompasses phishing at the moment

62
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,640
so leveraging the cloud uh

63
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,280
threat actors are more more often now

64
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,680
leveraging services such as google docs

65
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,160
google

66
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,680
forms canva type form

67
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,840
to support credential harvesting and to

68
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,120
support the delivery of malware

69
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,000
as you can see there google forms

70
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,280
harvesting at t

71
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,959
credentials canva it sort of hosts a

72
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,840
document that contains a malicious url

73
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,560
support delivery and then you've got

74
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,800
firefox send which was

75
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,120
probably the worst worst defender here

76
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,959
which actually shut down because it was

77
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,800
being abused by malware so much

78
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,800
i think it was being abused by the our

79
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,920
evil ransomware group

80
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,800
and and fin7 carbonite group you know

81
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,519
they

82
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,640
it was just so useful for them because

83
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,000
it had like a burn

84
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,959
burn url and it could and once one

85
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,080
person had opened it

86
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,560
it would delete itself and it was

87
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,599
encrypted

88
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,360
and all of these would just bypass

89
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,040
secure email gateways

90
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,720
and it's just really useful and very

91
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,879
simple to set up quick setup

92
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,959
and you can do it completely anonymously

93
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,239
so you can see how

94
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,159
much how this could be a big big issue

95
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,440
so some of you may have have uh noticed

96
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,720
on twitter that we had a bit of an issue

97
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,920
with a certain host

98
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,640
after we found or i found

99
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,599
1500 credentials on an open

100
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,680
website which can which included

101
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,599
so many different types of organizations

102
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,879
and i sent

103
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,159
this url to the host and they they came

104
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,680
back with an email as you can see in the

105
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,799
bottom left that said

106
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,599
we are unable to validate your claims uh

107
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,400
i

108
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,720
see this is the type of thing these are

109
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,400
the types of problems we face

110
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,080
with mass credential harvesting even

111
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,519
when we do locate

112
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,799
the entire campaign uh it it's

113
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,879
still difficult to take down and after a

114
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,400
bit of back and forth they eventually

115
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,680
blocked us

116
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,320
uh so this was the actual phishing email

117
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:18,959
that

118
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,279
was and campaign that was actually i was

119
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,240
mentioning in

120
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,120
that in that tweet and in that takedown

121
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,280
the attackers used sangrid

122
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,680
to which is an email marketing service

123
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,520
which with a free account

124
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,080
you can actually send up to like 30 000

125
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,040
emails

126
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,320
even with just a free trial um

127
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,919
this is the actual email we received

128
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,840
it's just like a play you have a

129
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,080
voice message play voice message button

130
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,320
there once you click that

131
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,560
it takes you to fake microsoft office

132
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,320
365 login page

133
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,919
and these were created on digital ocean

134
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,440
and i realized um there was actually

135
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,160
multiple of these pages as you can see

136
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,240
there erased voice checking voice no

137
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,000
voice note it's like a

138
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,160
that was the theme of the campaign so

139
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,919
when i when i

140
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,800
uh followed the actual like chain the

141
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,080
fishing chain

142
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,800
to get to the landing page i then uh

143
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,360
reversed engineered the page to find

144
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,520
the um the actual like the exfiltration

145
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,400
domain

146
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,720
it's just a domain in the code that was

147
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,560
obfuscated with

148
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,840
javascript and things and hdm packs

149
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,360
and things like that once i

150
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,120
de-obfuscated that i found the

151
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,639
exfiltration domain

152
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,759
and when i visited the domain did some

153
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,680
look through the directories on there i

154
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,880
found 1

155
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,600
500 credentials there and i was like oh

156
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,360
boy here we go

157
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,120
and in when i was scrolling through

158
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,880
those credentials that were

159
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,880
publicly accessible anyone with the url

160
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,320
could have visited it and just

161
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,680
stolen all of them um it was

162
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,319
included uk law enforcement email

163

they all have five eyes there

168
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,120
included employees from telecoms energy

169
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,759

and geolocation and to to verify whether

174
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,360
these were actually legit you could

175
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,240
actually

176
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,479
put the ip address in something like ipm

177
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,080
fill showdown you can see

178
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,919
it was in the country that the

179
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,280
organization was in

180
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,360
so there's a high chance he's actually

181
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,560
legit and

182
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,720
had managed to steal all these

183
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,759
credentials which is

184
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,400
kind of shocking to us and it took over

185
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,280
a week

186
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,360
to over to about 10 days i think to take

187
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,880
down whilst this campaign was gone going

188
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,880
the next the the one of the other

189
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,160
biggest parts of fishing that we are

190
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,599
seeing continuously now

191
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,039
is that uk finance is being targeted by

192
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:57,360
these

193
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,919
credential harvesting campaigns as well

194
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:00,720
and

195
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,240
most people consider two-factor

196
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,479
authentication like the best part

197
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,639
of the best way to mitigate from a

198
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,919
phishing attack

199
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,960
um it's it is good it is very good i'm

200
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,960
not going to knock it but there are

201
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,720
very there are many techniques to try

202
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,240
and bypass this

203
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,120
and such as this live fishing kits which

204
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,680
which can be deployed on multiple pages

205
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,599
and the pages will connect to one

206
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,759
gateway and that gateway is operated by

207
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,080
control panel with a web gui

208
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,840
so if someone visits this page they

209
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,599
enter their credentials and then

210
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,080
the the threat actor on the other end

211
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,759
gets a notification

212
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,800
saying a visitor has visited the site

213
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,280
they're entering the credentials you can

214
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,400
take that and log

215
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,759
in provide provide the user

216
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,639
with the prompt to enter their to the

217
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,080
2fa token

218
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,000
once they enter it that gets stolen as

219
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,440
well and then

220
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,599
even if there's only 30 seconds to log

221
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,680
in the the attacker has that as well

222
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,639
and then they get in

223
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,720
so the other part of phishing that we

224
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,919
see often is

225
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,240
the use of free malware hosting so

226
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,160
instead of actually having to create

227
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,440
a domain or create a website and post

228
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,240
your

229
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,520
payloads in there even though it's not

230
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,599
very difficult

231
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,879
uh attackers like to use for uh sort of

232
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,199
like cloud and content delivery networks

233
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,120
such as discord

234
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,160
to host their payloads so this is one

235
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,479
email we received from dhl

236
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,880
using the service at dhl email address

237
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,399
obviously spoofed

238
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,440
um they they sort of

239
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,279
issue like a notice they're saying oh

240
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,958
you've got a parcel on the way

241
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,559
and then they take a screen they take a

242
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,480
picture of an actual invoice from

243
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,760
probably from google or something like

244
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,720
that

245
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,120
when it's in i think it's intentionally

246
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,480
like blurred out so

247
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,399
you go to click on it to sort of zoom in

248
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,320
to see try and make out what the actual

249
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,760
information is there

250
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,640
that images actually has an embedded url

251
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,600
which is

252
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,519
points to a executable file hosted on

253
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,399
discord

254
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,160
because the discord cdn is actually

255
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,760
public

256
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,440
you know it just immediately will

257
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,959
download to a device and this was

258
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,800
actually a self-extracting archive

259
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,480
so once you clicked it immediately self

260
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,200
extracts and

261
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,959
injected into a legitimate process

262
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,279
uh the next one we see uh all the time

263
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,680
uh recently is the bizarre loader this

264
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,640
is

265
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,320
like one of the most dangerous malware

266
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,720
at the moment uh belonging to

267
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,760
the riot ransomware gang and the reason

268
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,120
it is so dangerous

269
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,760
is because it is it abuses multiple

270
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,839
legitimate services including google

271
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,320
docs aws buckets

272
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,480
and um sendgrid as well so

273
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,800
the user will receive a phishing email

274
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,240
from sendgrid

275
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,760
and in in the same grid email

276
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,120
will be a url to google docs

277
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,000
which is you know it's a trusted service

278
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,480
and

279
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,160
it will it will just allow you to visit

280
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,000
it without any flagging any

281
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,360
um problems in the google docs

282
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,200
there's a screenshot there in the middle

283
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,720
there'll be it will say

284
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,160
if the download does not start click

285
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,320
here once you click that

286
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,959
it will actually it contains the payload

287
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,160
as well there that

288
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,800
the review report exe file which

289
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,680
contains

290
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,200
the um the bizarre loader that is hosted

291
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,160
in the aws bucket for basecamp so

292
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,680
basecamp is a legitimate

293
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,240
document hosting a service but you can

294
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,880
also upload files to it to the open aws

295
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,079
bucket

296
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,240
so it also that comes from a legitimate

297
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,120
service

298
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,839
and is just able to able to bypass a lot

299
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,040
of detection systems

300
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,240
um you've also got trello there as being

301
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,040
abused

302
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,720
but there's other services i think slack

303
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,079
is being abused as well as well as

304
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,640
discord

305
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,000
evasion so the types of evasion that

306
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,279
threat actors like to use is um

307
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,760
comes in many forms you've got uh open

308
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,760
redirect urls this is something i find

309
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,040
all the time

310
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,680
where say if i'm reversing a fishing kit

311
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,279
sometimes they've just got

312
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,240
instructions in the txt file with how to

313
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,160
place how to actually distribute your

314
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,120
links

315
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,680
so in here there's a national trust

316
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,160
link there that was sent in a phishing

317
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,920
email once you it

318
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,760
so the server the your protection

319
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,680
systems will detect that it's from the

320
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,800
national trust

321
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,680
legitimate service and it will be rec it

322
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,240
will be

323
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,399
deemed a safe but if someone actually

324
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,079
clicks that link it takes you straight

325
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,360
to the credential harvesting page

326
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,959
you can see how that's a problem and

327
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,880
then you've got

328
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,680
malware malware choice career identified

329
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,040
um

330
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,000
smishing campaign sms phishing campaign

331
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
going on in korea at the moment

332
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,800
where the app the message you will get

333
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,680
will be

334
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,839
like oh you have a parcel on the way

335
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,480
check download this parcel tracking app

336
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,760
and it will have your phone number it's

337
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,920
the name of the file name so it's it's

338
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,720
actually

339
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,600
destined to the owner of the device and

340
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,639
if you find

341
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,680
the actual phishing page you won't be

342
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,399
able to download you won't be able to

343
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,320
basically investigate it without having

344
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,200
a phone number

345
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,720
on the database that the attackers are

346
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,480
uni using

347
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,959
so this is another method of evasion

348
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,639
though that's that's happening in korea

349
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,240
at the moment but it's gonna

350
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,680
eventually it's gonna make its way over

351
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,279
to europe and the us and

352
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,480
and other other places and then you've

353
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,160
also got

354
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,240
captures these are these are becoming

355
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,240
very very popular on fishing pages as

356
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:44,959
well

357
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,279
that basically prevents automated tools

358
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,279
from detecting them as malicious

359
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,399
as well as preventing someone filling up

360
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,200
the data with

361
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,279
spam text or pretty much because you

362
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,880
have to enter a captcha each time

363
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,680
and then you've also got negligent hosts

364
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,760
and bulletproof hosts that prolong

365
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,600
fishing campaigns these

366
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,839
these services we deal with all the time

367
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:08,880
trying to we

368
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,120
submit takedown requests and it often

369
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,800
can take over a week to two weeks to

370
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,240
actually take them down

371
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,000
because they don't really care about it

372
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,279
they don't care about it enough to

373
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,360
prioritize it and they all they

374
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,880
continually let them

375
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,399
to re re create the same same pages

376
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,240
pretty much with just a different

377
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,160
with just a dash in the middle um

378
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,000
and and give it a certificate as well

379
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,079
from let's encrypt or section it's

380
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,519
very easy to get a certificate for one

381
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,720
of these services

382
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,639
convince them that you're legitimate and

383
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,240
assign a certificate

384
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,959
and this the green padlock is actually

385
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,040
seen by many not average users

386
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,000
that that's a sign of legitimacy a sign

387
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,120
of safety

388
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,320
so it's it's a problem

389
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,600
so all these techniques uh tactics

390
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,880
techniques and procedures that i've

391
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,600
mentioned uh are being leveraged by

392
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,000
organized cyber crime groups that are

393
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,480
monetizing these attacks and these mass

394
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,440
campaigns and they are used to generate

395
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,839
millions from stolen credentials

396
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,839
payment details and all sorts

397
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,399
so the current one of the current things

398
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,360
that we

399
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,839
are monitoring as these phishing as a

400
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,040
service

401
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,199
offerings 16 shop is one of the biggest

402
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,839
for creating fishing kits and

403
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,440
distributing them

404
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,800
and these are used to to harvest amazon

405
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,360
paypal netflix credentials that are then

406
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,480
all then again

407
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,440
sold on underground forums and telegram

408
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,399
groups pretty much

409
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,760
on.net um as well as the kits themselves

410
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,920
offering those for sale

411
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,040
and it's all self-explanatory uh the

412
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,839
there's tutorials offered in the uh

413
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,760
in the actual service and support as

414
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,760
well so if if you're having if

415
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,320
if the actor is struggling to set it up

416
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,519
they can contact

417
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,120
the developers and be like hey can i

418
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,120
have some help setting up this fishing

419
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:15,519
kit

420
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,160
and you know they'll happily tell you

421
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,360
exactly what to do to get you started

422
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,279
and if you go on if you go on youtube

423
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,880
you can literally type in

424
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,160
scam page and then the name of a brand

425
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,600
and it will probably be a tutorial on

426
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,079
how to

427
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,720
set up a phishing page it's this stuff

428
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,480
is very easy to find

429
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,199
um these are just some other examples of

430
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,800
what we're seeing at the moment

431
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,839
in the bottom right there you've got um

432
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,040
you're actually a little bit more

433
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,120
sophisticated to fishing as a service

434
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,000
equipment

435
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,720
equipment like cyber crime tools there

436
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,519
silent pdf exploit macro builder data

437
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,440
protector

438
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,079
pretty basic stuff but it just you know

439
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,199
it's a service

440
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:01,359
offered to other cyber criminals

441
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,199
business email compromise so this is

442
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,240
probably one of the

443
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,079
greatest probably the one the most

444
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,079
costly attacks that we are

445
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,720
currently seeing is where i think most

446
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,160
people knows what know what this is

447
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:14,800
where

448
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,440
a threat actor will convince an employee

449
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,360
to transfer funds to the wrong account

450
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,680
via phishing

451
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,160
so ray hush puppy a dubai based nigerian

452
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,399
vip

453
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,759
scammer he was one of the most notorious

454
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,839
uh he was arrested by dubai police in

455
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,320
june 2020 in a case called operation fox

456
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,600
hunt 2.

457
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,639
he actually had i think he had over

458
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,680
1.8 million followers on instagram and

459
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,600
he was flaunting his wealth there

460
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,680
see he's driving a bugatti veyron and

461
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,279
his private jet

462
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,600
um you know he was he was hiding in

463
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,680
plain sight pretty much

464
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,839
and he was stealing he was response he

465
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,759
was found responsible by the fbi and

466
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,600
dubai police were stealing millions of

467
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,000
dollars in five bc attacks against large

468
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,360
organizations

469
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,160
such as a u.s law firm foreign bank

470
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,599
english premier league football club

471
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,319
even

472
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,720
so just just by basically using a typo

473
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,079
scoring debate

474
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,400
um emailing the right person and

475
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,520
convincing them

476
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,760
to that they're going to change the you

477
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,919
know bank account address to this one

478
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,280
and then eventually the money gets

479
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,400
transferred and then

480
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,079
they have this vast money laundering

481
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,039
network to make it disappear

482
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,720
so these bc scammers because they're

483
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,559
actually pulling in so much money doing

484
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,360
this

485
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,720
they're actually cooperating with really

486
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,039
advanced cyber crime organizations such

487
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,160
as fin seven

488
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,080
which is a you know also known as

489
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,080
carbonaccous a russian gang

490
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,760
that was actually responsible for

491
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,120
hacking the bank of the

492
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,160
valletta in malta it's dealing 13

493
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,760
million euros in that

494
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,679
and it was actually found that in the

495
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,200
indictment the

496
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,520
the the money stolen from that bank was

497
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,280
actually laundered via hush puppies

498
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,039
money laundering network

499
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,240
so as you can see just from

500
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,080
just from fishing attacks you've got

501
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,080
millions of of

502
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,880
of dollars and euros being laundered in

503
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,360
this way

504
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,960
so the emo tech spam botnet if you know

505
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,559
if i was going to do a talk on fishing

506
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,240
it would be

507
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,880
i couldn't can't miss out emote it's

508
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,320
it's the greatest

509
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,480
it's probably by far the greatest threat

510
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,840
that we are seeing on the threat

511
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,559
landscape

512
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,080
in terms of fishing campaigns is uh

513
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,640
it's known it's basically the largest

514
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,320
power distribution network

515
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,880
in history and it's responsible for

516
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,240
delivering

517
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,080
hundreds of thousands if not millions of

518
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,440
emails per month

519
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,360
and i think hornick security uncovered

520
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,640
that from this

521
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,200
is actually leads to 25 000 downloads

522
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,400
per hour

523
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,120
um all that established a foothold in an

524
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,480
organization

525
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,720
so emote arrived i think it arrived

526
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,039
about 2014 and 2015

527
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,200
as a banking trojan it has since evolved

528
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,960
it's not not really a banking trojan

529
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,679
anymore

530
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,960
it it's a downloaded trojan and it's an

531
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,200
infostealer as well it will collect

532
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,320
it will compromise the user's inbox

533
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,080
uh mail client and it will just

534
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,640
exfiltrate all the

535
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,640
the contact list and the contents of the

536
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,000
inbox there

537
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,640
and it all like one of the rings and one

538
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,480
of the things that makes it so effective

539
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,360
is that it's not it doesn't just arrive

540
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,160
as a random

541
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,200
email in your inbox it actually it

542
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,440
if someone on your contact list you

543
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,520
regularly talk to is compromised

544
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,760
emote will actually go through your

545
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,640
emails and reply to a previous call

546
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,080
conversation with a download url or a

547
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,760
malicious document attached

548
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,520
so you think and because the client is

549
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,840
compromised you think is actually coming

550
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,120
from the person on your contact list

551
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,080
so it's as you can see it's so effective

552
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:54,720
in that way

553
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,520
especially when an entire organization

554
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,440
can get like up to 20

555
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,440
say up to 20 people's inboxes can all

556
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,400
get compromised and it can just spread

557
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,240
you can just spread really really far

558
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,840
that way and

559
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,039
the the other part of

560
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,400
emote because it has such a fast

561
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,679
now a distribution network it enables

562
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,840
other types of cyber crime such as

563
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,080
ransomware campaigns and the trickbot

564
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,840
banking trojan

565
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,280
these emu basically drops

566
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,280
the trickbot banking trojan onto the

567
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,720
infected systems

568
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,600
and then from there trickbot is one of

569
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,720
the most advanced

570
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,919
malware so it has about 30 modules and

571
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:40,720
from there

572
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,559
they can pick and choose what they want

573
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:43,840
to do on that

574
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,360
compromise network and then

575
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,640
you know they can choose whether they

576
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,799
want to steal credentials

577
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,120
from the infected devices move around

578
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,880
naturally

579
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,760
and then you know they can deliver the

580
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,440
ransomware which they usually do which

581
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,120
they have been doing

582
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,159
um in in these you know really

583
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,400
aggressive ransomware campaigns i think

584
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,000
this weekend it has been one of the

585
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,559
largest number of attacks on u.s and

586
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,280
canadian hospitals since wannacry

587
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,000
if you look into it if you um you can

588
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,960
see uh

589
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,880
i don't know i don't know the precise

590
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,400
number of how many hospitals have been

591
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,120
hit

592
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,000
but it's the numbers are increasing and

593
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,520
the us authorities are

594
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,400
issuing joint advisories it's a really

595
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,360
serious problem

596
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,120
and it all starts with emote really

597
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,600
so some mitigation for some of the

598
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,120
phishing that we're seeing

599
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,679
includes multi-factor authentication

600
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,360
two-factor authentication

601
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,919
although these can there are methods to

602
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,919
bypass them it doesn't make them

603
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,320
like it makes they are still invaluable

604
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,039
because

605
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,840
even if your credentials get breached in

606
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,840
in a data breach online

607
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,520
then you know even if they try to log

608
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,400
into your account

609
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,240
because they've got tools that can log

610
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,559
into thousands of accounts per second

611
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,520
even if they try to you can block it

612
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,120
because they don't have access to your

613
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,080
actual phone

614
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,760
and your phone number and then you've

615
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,080
got a block list of malicious domains

616
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:16,400
who

617
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,919
we work i work for a cyber threat

618
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,080
intelligence company we provide

619
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,640
uh you know ic feeds from the latest

620
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,080
phishing campaigns to make sure you're

621
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,360
actually protected

622
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,120
for and don't receive any of these

623
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,480
phishing emails so they don't even get a

624
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,640
chance to target you

625
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,799
and then take down requests as well you

626
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:33,760
want to issue

627
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,280
take down requests to bring them down

628
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,799
to stop these campaigns as well as

629
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,120
uh anti-malware and anti-malware best

630
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,000
practices

631
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,520
you know you want to keep your software

632
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,520
update and you want to ensure logging

633
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,640
and isolate infected systems you know if

634
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,720
a system is infected with emote

635
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,559
you want to stop that or trick bot you

636
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,480
want to stop that from being able to

637
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,240
spread around your network as soon as

638
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,400
possible

639
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,960
as well as password security yeah you

640
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,799
want to ensure

641
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,600
your password is strong make sure no one

642
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,799
can brute force it

643
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,360
that just goes without saying by now as

644
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,000
well as

645
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,720
uh simulation and red teams you know you

646
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,480
don't have to go for the full

647
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,640
packet red team package but you know

648
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,000
sometimes it might be worth doing

649
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,960
a simulated phishing a test uh across

650
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,000
your entire

651
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,880
organization once a year you know just

652
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,520
to see

653
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,880
identify any weaknesses um

654
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,640
i think awareness training is also very

655
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,720
important for an organization

656
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,880
um phishing emails can arrive every

657
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,919
single day so it's

658
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,159
it's important that when onboarding new

659
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,000
staff they have to go through security

660
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,640
training

661
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,320
and make sure they actually understand

662
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,000
what phishing email is

663
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,880
and how it how it can target you in many

664
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,279
different ways

665
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,760
and and one of the most successful ways

666
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,520
of preventing phishing attacks is a very

667
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,080
simple if

668
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,559
you want to simplify the method of

669
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:01,679
reporting

670
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,480
so you want to simplify like if someone

671
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,000
receives a phishing email

672
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,960
you want to make it simple for them to

673
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,640
contact the it team

674
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,080
and let them know they're not sure

675
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,760
whether it is legit or fake

676
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,240
that is one or like that is one of the

677
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,520
simplest way

678
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,159
to you know stop these campaigns and

679
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,039
catch them early on

680
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,080
uh email forwarding rules is also

681
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,880
one of the fastest ways to detect if a

682
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,039
if you've actually already been breached

683
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,960
in a phishing attack is once they've

684
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,320
logged into the

685
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,400
email once they've logged into the email

686
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,840
client

687
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,400
they usually will set up a they will

688
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,360
usually set up

689
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,320
a email forwarding rule that so

690
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,039
you know once the uh once the system has

691
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,080
been

692
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,600
once the email client has been

693
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,279
compromised they will then any email

694
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,960
that they get with the keyword will

695
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,400
actually be forwarded

696
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,360
to the attackers you know exfiltration

697
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,559
address pretty much

698
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,840
so you want to check for those other

699
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,320
you know other simple methods is have i

700
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,080
been pwned everything everyone knows

701
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,600
about that you can check whether your

702
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,440
email address has actually

703
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,240
appeared in a breach and you can also

704
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,240
set up a notification so any new

705
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,760
breaches that turn up

706
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,600
you can get notified if your if your

707
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,520
email just address is in there

708
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,600
if if that breach contains con like the

709
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,120
contents of your password

710
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,559
might as well you might want to change

711
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,880
that um

712
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,880
and then have i been emote this is

713
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,480
actually a really new service i think

714
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:34,880
only

715
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,120
released maybe a month or two ago you

716
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,159
can actually check

717
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,480
if your email address is actually

718
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,000
present in the emo tech spam

719
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,799
list and that is that could be really

720
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:45,440
interesting

721
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,320
because you can then identify whether

722
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,600
like whether your partners have been

723
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,120
compromised or

724
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,520
you know it's it's uh and once it's on

725
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,360
that spot once it's on that spam list

726
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,039
it's there forever and it will just get

727
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,559
passed around to other

728
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,039
others organized cyber crime groups

729
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,159
really

730
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,200
so you want to think about that

731
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,400
my prediction so what i predict will

732
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,720
happen in the future of fishing

733
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,159
is that i think smishing will grow

734
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,440
as as a popular method for attacks

735
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,679
uh traditional fishing i don't think it

736
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:20,480
will

737
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,320
actually ever disappear but it will only

738
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,559
ever it will only like smishing will

739
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,240
only ever catch up with it

740
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,600
and maybe one day eventually overtake it

741
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,440
um as you know as people move away from

742
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,000
email

743
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,159
and and starting to use collaborate

744
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,640
collaborative applications such as

745
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,520
microsoft teams and slack um anything

746
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:43,840
that

747
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,320
usually could be done over an email is

748
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,279
now just sent

749
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,080
through uh you know a collaborative app

750
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,039
you just

751
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,640
just ping someone that way and it's much

752
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,640
faster than an email

753
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,720
and then any sensitive conversations

754
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,919
that you may be having

755
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,000
over email might be worth thinking

756
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,520
whether they could actually be done over

757
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,159
zoom

758
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,360
or webex or something like that and as i

759
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,000
mentioned earlier

760
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,919
with the with the database of phone

761
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,400
numbers uh those ttps those tactics

762
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,000
techniques and procedures will

763
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,720
always be upgraded continually upgraded

764
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,480
and deployed in new geography so it's

765
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,600
actually important

766
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,200
as a cyber threat intelligence company

767
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,720
to monitor what's going on

768
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,559
in different countries because then you

769
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,399
can alert your

770
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,080
you know clients whether it can actually

771
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,799
arrive to you before it before it does

772
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,200
and then i also expect that there will

773
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,600
be increased losses you know in 2019

774
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,520
the fbi's internet crime complaint

775
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,039
center reported

776
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,559
23 775 complaints

777
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,799
so and that and you know that equaled

778
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,360
1.7 billion in losses yeah i reckon this

779
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:45,760
year

780
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,399
it will probably be much higher if all

781
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:49,120
in all

782
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,320
so wait for that one to come out

783
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,600
and that is my talk i hope you enjoyed

784
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,559
it

785
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:00,480
and keep an eye out for those phishing

786
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,720
emails

787
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,679
well that was that was brilliant thank

788
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,520
you so much for sharing all of that

789
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,000
stuff

790
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,080
i do have sort of one question that i

791
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,760
want to kind of like

792
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:16,640
um ask you around and heard

793
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,520
about a lot of sort of non-traditional

794
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,000
places of storing either payloads or

795
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,120
things like that

796
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,640
do you want to talk a little bit about

797
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,159
some of those discoveries that you've

798
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,320
made

799
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,760
yeah so for for malicious

800
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,320
services no first legitimate services

801
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,320
being used in legitimate ways we

802
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,679
see those all the time i i saw

803
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,919
we recently got a i think it was a

804
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:43,279
message from is a fake

805
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,000
message from your ceo in air quotes

806
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,399
which

807
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:50,240
actually it it's a it's a url in there

808
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,480
which takes you to base camp which is as

809
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,080
i said before it's legitimate

810
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,880
service and then from there that just

811
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,559
takes you to their

812
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,720
landing page so these services although

813
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,520
they might not actually be holding

814
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,080
not always holding the payloads inside

815
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,240
them they are also often used as like

816
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,760
stepping stones

817
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,399
to to that are abused by threat actors

818
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:13,120
and

819
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,799
and and that's all they're also very

820
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,720
difficult to get removed because there's

821
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,159
not alway i think

822
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,880
maybe google and microsoft they're like

823
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,399
some of the slowest at

824
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:25,600
takedowns and it's painstakingly

825
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,200
hard to get them to actually remove

826
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,720
something just because

827
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,240
they must just get millions of these

828
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,600
takedown requests every day

829
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,080
brilliant thank you so much man that's

830
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:38,640
right

831
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,840
thank you thank you everyone
