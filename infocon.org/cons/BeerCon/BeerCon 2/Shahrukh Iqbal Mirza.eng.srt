1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:05,200
uh

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,919
thanks very much for rejoining us um up

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:08,880
next we have

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,599
uh shahrukh who's going to give us a

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,280
talk on kerber roasting i think you were

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,360
the only cfp

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,279
applicant to submit two different talks

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:18,880
and said pick one

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,279
and we genuinely couldn't pick between

10
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,560
the two it was

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,800
it was a really really tough call so i'm

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,320
gonna pass it over to you man

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,519
you do your stuff you're gonna be

14
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,519
awesome best of luck thanks man

15
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,719
uh hello everyone uh very good evening

presentation

19
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,200
uh to start off first of all i'd like to

20
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,640
thank the amazing beer farmers for

21
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,079
putting together this conference

22
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,480
and giving us a platform and a chance to

23
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,520
speak

24
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,079
uh a massive uh thank you to all the

25
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,120
amazing mentors

26
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,440
who helped us helped us throughout with

27
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,440
the preparations motivations calming

28
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,879
down nerves

29
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,879
and finally all my awesome fellow

30
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,719
speakers who in spite of having to

31
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,559
prepare for their own talks

32
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,959
uh helped me with the uh presentation

33
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,799
ryan's and provided me with

34
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,960
the available feedback and criticisms

35
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,240
regarding my talk

36
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,760
a huge shout out to all you guys so

37
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,600
i'm going to be presenting on an active

38
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,159
directory attack curb roasting

39
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,320
uh firstly uh let me tell you why i

40
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,759
chose this topic and then we'll move

41
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,320
forward with the presentation itself

42
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,320
uh well recently i've been interested in

43
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,080
enterprise security and especially

44
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,680
active directory pen testing

45
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,640
uh as it as it has been uh quite a hot

46
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,560
topic in the recent times and secondly

47
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,280
because

48
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,280
active directory is mostly used in many

49
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,720
organizations

50
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,600
and knowing a d pen testing

51
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,759
misconfigurations

52
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,920
security flaws weaknesses is important

53
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,759
for both red and blue teams so i thought

54
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,439
why not start with kerberos as

55
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,280
uh it is the default authentication

56
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,920
protocol used by

57
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,200
microsoft active directory anyway let's

58
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,320
move forward

59
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,960
so a little bit of who i am and what i

60
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,960
do i'm basically a petroleum engineering

61
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,799
graduate who's turned into an infosec

62
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:03,920
enthusiast

63
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,240
i'm pursuing my ms in information

64
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,280
security

65
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,360
i try to be a pen tester and an ethical

66
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,200
hacker also a seasonal

67
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,560
bug bounty hunter and

68
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,640
when i'm not hacking or studying for my

69
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,000
ms

70
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
i usually play fifa and i'm a huge

71
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,160
football

72
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,160
fan and especially support manchester

73
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,360
united so

74
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,840
ggmu for the victory last night

75
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,360
well uh that's enough of me so

76
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,480
here's the agenda for today firstly

77
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,319
we'll take a trip down memory lane

78
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,760
and uh i'll uh this

79
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,840
and we'll have a brief intro then we'll

80
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,280
have a brief intro about the attack

81
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,319
itself

82
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,800
uh then we will die dive a little deeper

83
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,360
into

84
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,519
what kara bruce basically is and how the

85
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,680
authentication protocol works

86
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,239
and then we'll move towards uh

87
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,080
explaining where the vulnerability lies

88
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,400
and what makes it possible to verb roast

89
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,440
and afterwards we'll have a practical

90
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,040
demonstration of the attack and

91
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,080
i've skipped one point i have included

92
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,480
uh the defense and mitigation techniques

93
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,080
and detection techniques for the blue

94
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,640
team as well

95
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,760
so how it all began it began back in

96
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,560
2014 during the days of derbycon 4.2

97
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,920
tim medin uh discovered this attack

98
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,480
and which basically is an attack against

99
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,920
kerberos in an active directory

100
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,480
environment

101
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,159
targeting service accounts or user

102
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,319
accounts that have service principal

103
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,519
names set a little overview of the

104
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:38,799
attack itself

105
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,040
so basically this is a credential

106
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,840
dumping plus privilege escalation

107
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,519
technique uh which has been listed in

108
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,959
the miter attack framework as an

109
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,480
enterprise attack vector bearing the

110
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,280
technique id 105

111
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,560
8.003 so how this attack basically works

112
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,920
is the attacker first

113
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,080
identifies existing spns in the domain

114
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,760
he then requests service tickets for

115
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,400
those spn's from the domain controller

116
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,000
and then uses a credential dumping

117
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,480
technique to get the service tickets out

118
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,640
from the memory and then takes those

119
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,640
service tickets off the domain

120
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,000
to crack offline for clear tax

121
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,120
credentials for plain text credentials

122
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,800
so if you're confused about all of this

123
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,479
well i've got you covered in the next

124
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,479
couple of slides we'll look at

125
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,960
kerberos uh authentication and you'll

126
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,280
start to see the pieces fall into place

127
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,600
all right so kerberos to put it simply

128
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,000
uh whenever user requires the use of any

129
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,080
service in the domain network they first

130
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,919
must authenticate themselves and who is

131
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,840
in charge of the authentication

132
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,680
is the freaking three-headed guard top

133
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,840
of the underworld kerberos

134
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,840
so how uh kerberos authentication works

135
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,960
uh is the first the user first logs on

136
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,280
to

137
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,600
their workstation and enters their user

138
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,440
id and password on into the client

139
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,240
application for

140
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,280
the service they desire to access

141
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,479
uh the the client application then

142
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,800
encrypts a timestamp with the passwords

143
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,160
password and sends it to the

144
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,160
authentication server

145
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,479
the authentication server looks into its

146
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,160
printable principle database for the

147
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,240
password that matches the user id

148
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,919
and then decrypts the encrypted

149
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,759
timestamp and then issues a ticket

150
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,039
granting ticket

151
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,280
encrypted with the user's password and

152
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,560
sends it back to the client application

153
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,840
uh then this tgt

154
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,800
all right so then this tgt is sent to

155
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,120
the

156
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,039
uh to a ticket grunting server along

157
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,160
with the spn

158
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,039
of the desired service which verifies

159
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:41,919
the received

160
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,080
tgd with the authentication server and

161
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,639
then it sends a service grant

162
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,880
service ticket back to the client

163
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,080
application

164
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,000
the client application finally sends the

165
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,520
service ticket to the

166
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,600
ad network services provider which is

167
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,199
basically the main controller

168
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,960
and after verification of this service

169
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,639
ticket the user gets authorized

170
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,600
access to their desired service all

171
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,960
right so this is how

172
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,240
kerberos authentication works so

173
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,800
uh now what's it now what makes it

174
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,039
possible to abuse kerberos

175
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,319
well firstly kerberos use uses shared

176
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,720
secrets for authentication

177
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,080
as you may see uh during the first phase

178
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,960
the user's password is shared between

179
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,720
the authentication server and the client

180
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,120
application

181
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,560
then in the next phase

182
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,960
uh uh the ticket granting ticket is

183
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,639
shared between the ticket granting uh

184
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,479
server and the client uh

185
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,960
and the client workstation and then

186
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,720
finally the service ticket is shared

187
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,360
between

188
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,319
uh the ticket branding server and the uh

189
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,840
ad network services provider

190
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,960
so

191
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,800
and the user's passwords are used to

192
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,080
encrypt everything so

193
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,319
basically if an attacker gets hold of

194
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,840
these service tickets he can then crack

195
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,120
them offline for

196
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,639
the service accounts uh passwords

197
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,400
so this is not based this is not a

198
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,599
vulnerability this is basically

199
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,199
all right third sec uh second

200
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,440
secondly the kerberos does not verify

201
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,880
whether the user requesting these

202
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,639
service tickets has permission to use

203
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,400
the service or not meaning that

204
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,560
any user can request service tickets for

205
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,840
any service

206
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,840
so this is not a vulnerability in

207
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,599
kerberos this is basically a design

208
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:30,880
feature

209
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,000
of how kerberos works so

210
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,840
until now we've seen the theoretical

211
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,199
aspects of these attacks

212
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,080
now it will allow me to make a quick try

213
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,199
to the democrats

214
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,840
and let's start with the demo

215
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,440
so i'm gonna be using the assume

216
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,639
breach approach all right

217
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,599
so i'm going i'm going to show you guys

218
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,878
two approaches to this attack

219
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,000
the first approach is that for example

220
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,919
we have a compromised

221
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:13,840
domain user in a domain environment

222
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,960
if i check my privileges i'm just a

223
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,000
regular domain user

224
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,159
all right now what i'll do is i'll

225
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,838
check the domain for

226
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,839
existing spns

227
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,760
and you see we have an existing spn

228
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,959
found for

229
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,640
sorry for sql service

230
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,600
now what i'll do is i'll quickly power

231
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,080
up

232
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,600
a power shell fire up powershell

233
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,320
and now i'll request uh these service

234
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,040
tickets

235
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,160
from in uh from the uh from kerberos and

236
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,519
store them in

237
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:23,360
in in the memory

238
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,120
let me get my notes

239
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:37,839
for the commands

240
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,839
so

241
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,279
i'm gonna copy this spn right here paste

242
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,040
it here

243
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,399
and now if i check

244
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,600
as you see this uh ticket from

245
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,600
for service secret for sql service has

246
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,040
been stored inside the memory

247
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:15,839
all right so now

248
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,880
let's get mimi cats to

249
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,640
extract out the service tickets from the

250
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,839
memory

251
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,560
we have our service tickets now what

252
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,320
i'll do is i'll quickly

253
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,560
trans uh transfer these service tickets

254
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,880
onto my

255
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,920
kali box right here

256
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,880
and then we can crack them for clear

257
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,920
text credentials

258
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,839
of the domain

259
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,680
let me just zip these files so that it

260
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,000
make

261
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,959
it me it makes it easier for me to

262
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,839
transfer

263
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,839
bye

264
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,839
so

265
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,519
uh

266
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,839
all right

267
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,800
now we have our service tickets so

268
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,040
i'll be using uh john the rapper to

269
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,639
crack these service tickets but the

270
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:49,519
thing is that

271
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,440
uh john doesn't understand these service

272
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,839
tickets in uh dot kirby form so

273
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,720
what i'll do is i'll first convert them

274
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,760
into a form that

275
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,000
uh john can understand so for that i'll

276
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,160
use this script kirby to join

277
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,040
and the ticket we're interested in is

278
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:17,839
this sql service

279
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:31,839
give it a word list

280
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:45,839
let's wait for john to practice ticket

281
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,839
so

282
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,160
there we go we have a clear text

283
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,440
password for the sql service account

284
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,000
now the second approach that i was uh

285
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,480
talking

286
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,519
about earlier is for example we

287
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,680
did not compromise a windows box in a

288
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,000
domain

289
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,199
environment instead we find a user's

290
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,639
password

291
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,920
so what we what we can do is uh we can

292
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,560
plug our

293
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,240
attacking machine into the domain

294
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,560
environment into the domain network

295
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,199
and then we can use a script from uh

296
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,320
impact toolkit

297
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,759
the use get user spns and what it will

298
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,600
do is it will basically

299
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,480
automate the entire process and give us

300
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,160
the seven second

301
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,160
so let's just do that

302
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,399
in packet toolkit scripts have a really

303
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,519
weird syntax

304
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,199
syntaxes so let me check my notes for

305
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:25,839
the

306
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:37,839
correct syntax

307
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:43,839
now we put in the user's password

308
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,079
ip of the domain controller

309
00:16:50,079 --> 00:17:05,839
let's see what the ip basically is

310
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,799
and you see in really no time at all we

311
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,000
have the service ticket

312
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,440
for sql service

313
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:47,840
same thing i'll copy this

314
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,000
paste it right here and

315
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,840
give this file to

316
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,840
drawn

317
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,918
you

318
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,480
and once again john has revealed the

319
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,320
plain text credentials for sql service

320
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,919
account

321
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,880
so that's how you go on performing curb

322
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,039
roasting

323
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,120
now for the detection and mitigation

324
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,320
part

325
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,400
detection is fairly simple you just have

326
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,320
to enable the ordered cargo secure

327
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,480
ticket of service ticket operations

328
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,559
uh in the domain controller and look

329
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,080
specifically for the

330
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,200
event id 4769 now

331
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,600
uh you will get to see this a lot of

332
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,360
times so

333
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,919
good practice is to establish a

334
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,080
threshold for example

335
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,600
uh if this idea appears uh more than

336
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,039
like 20 times or 25 times then

337
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,360
there's something fishy going on another

338
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,280
thing that you can do is you can

339
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,720
uh use honey spns they basically work

340
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,480
on the same uh principle as honeypots

341
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,559
you create a fake service you assign a

342
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:43,760
fake spn to it

343
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,039
and make sure that your domain users

344
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,240
never use never use or interact with

345
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:50,960
this

346
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,919
fake server so when an attacker gets uh

347
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,280
gets into your network

348
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,720
he doesn't know that this is a honey

349
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,480
skin right so

350
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,640
he'll request uh the service ticket for

351
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,559
uh the fake service as well and that's

352
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:03,679
how you can

353
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,120
identify that kermit hosting is being

354
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,120
performed well for the mitigation part

355
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,039
uh since i said that this is not a

356
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,280
vulnerability rather a design feature of

357
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,640
kerberos

358
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,200
so it cannot be be mitigated

359
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,720
uh by applying patches or applying some

360
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,880
fixes rather you can use strong and

361
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,720
complex password policies

362
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,919
to uh make the tracking of service

363
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:32,480
tickets

364
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,640
a bit difficult and secondly you can

365
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,240
limit service accounts from

366
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,600
administrative privileges

367
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:47,280
and yeah credits and references for

368
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,840
for uh for further reading you may go to

369
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,000
active directory security you can read

370
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,960
read it about biter attack and red team

371
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,880
experiments

372
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:02,960
and that's all thank you

373
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,400
so awesome awesome stuff um even more

374
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,159
kudos for doing the devo

375
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,360
uh you probably see those people go oh

376
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,000
devo

377
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,120
uh it is always a risky thing and you've

378
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,320
pulled it off really well so great work

379
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:18,960
there

380
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,520
um thank goodness to the demo guards

381
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,440
actually i was afraid that my lab

382
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,039
environment doesn't break because

383
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,600
a couple of days ago i sat down to test

384
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,120
my demo and

385
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,320
it was completely broken down well

386
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,400
really happy that it all worked out and

387
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,799
yeah amazing stuff

388
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,679
um i'm just trying to look if there are

389
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:42,240
any

390
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,960
questions and i don't see any questions

391
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,480
um just for me

392
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,200
um is this kind of attack something you

393
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,159
see often

394
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,000
uh or is something that you could

395
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
probably exploit um

396
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,039
that you you come across often

397
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,159
uh yeah so basically when i get onto a

398
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,000
domain environment the first thing i do

399
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,840
is look for service accounts and

400
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,960
then use curb hosting to request service

401
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,760
tickets

402
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,120
so yeah it's easy to perform it has

403
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,400
a potential and

404
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,919
it is dangerous because

405
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,480
a majority of the time i've seen service

406
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,200
accounts with

407
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,039
uh higher privileges than the regular

408
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,640
domain user account

409
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,440
so yeah

410
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,520
yeah that's actually a really good point

411
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,200
because i think many people

412
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,520
often forget about service accounts or

413
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,280
just don't pay as

414
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,600
as much attention to those accounts than

415
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,760
typical user accounts so

416
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,480
um i think those pretty good juicy

417
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,520
targets

418
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,720
um i gotta admit i don't know much about

419
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,120
this stuff at all

420
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,720
so i found this really interesting

421
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,760
well so similar situation to sean and

422
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,679
similar situation actually to the last

423
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:02,880
speaker vivian

424
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,840
um when i was talking about ipv6 being

425
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,120
quite

426
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,400
um scary intimidating to

427
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,280
kind of start to look at or get into um

428
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,159
when it comes to

429
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,400
any hack-the-box server that mentions

430
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,480
kerberos or kerberos i just

431
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,240
you know you do that thing where you're

432
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,120
like i'll get to it later

433
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,120
um and you never do and you've made it

434
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,159
super accessible

435
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,000
that makes a lot of sense and i can

436
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,360
understand that

437
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,480
um basically there's no

438
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,840
main questions in the chat other than

439
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,840
people going absolutely bananas over the

440
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,679
fact that the live demos worked without

441
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:40,240
a hitch

442
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,200
that honestly massive kudos and respect

443
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,080
for doing that

444
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,279
um it completely worked perfect

445
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,400
every time they were sacrificing cyber

446
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,720
goats left right and center for you

447
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,480
it was great um no massive massive

448
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,200
massive respect and you know what you

449
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,559
every single speaker's done this but

450
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,159
you've definitely done this with

451
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,559
kerberos you've made me want to actually

452
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,640
go and try and figure out how all works

453
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,120
and look

454
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,200
you know try some of the hack the box

455
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,640
machines with

456
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,480
what you've basically just explained

457
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,720
there made it super accessible so

458
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,360
thank you so much there is a question

459
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,320
from twitch

460
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,039
from jennyside since kerberostein is a

461
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:21,679
technique

462
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,919
not a vulnerability is there a standard

463
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,039
defense

464
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,440
uh other than block mummy cats

465
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,120
signatures

466
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,600
uh mimikaz basically allows you to

467
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,279
extract those service tickets right

468
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,400
so mimik ads blocking gaming cards is

469
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,840
entirely different from preventing

470
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,080
carbon roasting mimics can be used to

471
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,799
get clear text credentials from uh the

472
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,480
lcs process

473
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,279
so if you block mimikaze you can prevent

474
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,400
curb roasting

475
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,960
uh but there's not a definite solution

476
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,440
for curb roasting because uh

477
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,679
as i said this is a design feature right

478
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,919
so all you can do is you can make your

479
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,320
uh passwords more complex ensure that

480
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,679
you that your users

481
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,360
change your passwords regularly

482
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,279
use a different password each time

483
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,080
and not reuse their passwords forgotten

484
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,840
passwords and whatsoever

485
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:23,600
awesome um yeah and again

486
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,279
fantastic talk so

487
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,400
i think that's us um i don't see any

488
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,600
other questions

489
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,440
um uh scott do you have any other

490
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,039
questions

491
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,120
no i would just be repeating again and

492
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,480
again how

493
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,799
awesome that was everything just worked

494
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,559
and it was super accessible

495
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,799
um i can't tell you enough how much i

496
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,799
just delayed looking at any of that and

497
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:47,760
you've made me

498
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,440
really want to go into it so thanks yeah

499
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,200
okay well thanks sharok um

500
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:03,679
and yeah again awesome talk
