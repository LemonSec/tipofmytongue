1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,540
everyone thanks for coming back up next

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,529
we have Lisa Forte for the say pronounce

3
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:10,290
your surname cranky you did well it

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,380
means a lot it means actually also means

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:22,619
strong Lisa so why don't you just give a

6
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:24,990
little bit about yourself and what it is

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,510
you do um okay

8
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,429
all right let's for police a couple of

9
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:35,250
years ago I set up my own company and we

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,809
sort of specialize in social engineering

11
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:39,870
inside threats like that and also sort

12
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,690
of running crisis simulations it

13
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,789
rehearsing a cyber attacks so the board

14
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:46,739
and things like that which is always

15
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:48,809
really good fun so that's sort of what

16
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:53,309
we do awesome and the name of your

17
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:54,690
company is pretty interesting so I

18
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,750
haven't actually come about to be honest

19
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,820
I wish there was like this amazing story

20
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,840
behind it

21
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,300
but it is actually because when I was

22
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,309
forming the company I couldn't think of

23
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:07,290
a name and all the names I thought

24
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,930
that's too boring playing around with

25
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,510
things and it just so happened that that

26
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,229
day I was reading New Scientist magazine

27
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:18,509
and in there there was an article about

28
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:20,100
some research that had been done by a

29
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,799
university and they discovered that

30
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,070
goats can identify intruders into their

31
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,860
herd just by hearing their voice and I

32
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,140
thought that is incredible so that's

33
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,600
where red goat came from and the sort of

34
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,909
funny by-product of it apart from being

35
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:38,640
kind of memorable is that one of my

36
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,829
clients when I go in the receptionist

37
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:44,820
says oh the good lady's here right in

38
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,369
because you know what though baby goats

39
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:49,619
are adorable so like you know I think

40
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:52,350
that's a kind of cool thing exactly and

41
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,299
I mean being called the goat lady is

42
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:56,189
just literally a dream come true where

43
00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:00,450
they say that's awesome I mean so I mean

44
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,430
your company title is something that I

45
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,520
personally worry about a lot and my role

46
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,740
is around insider threats

47
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,470
so do you only maybe dive in a bit more

48
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,680
some of the things you have seen yeah

49
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,900
we've done a lot of research actually we

50
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,510
did a research report that I like free

51
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,379
open-source for everyone to download on

52
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:23,939
sort of reporting and we it was really

53
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:26,640
interesting because I knew that

54
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,769
generally if people saw suspicious

55
00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:31,290
behavior being conducted by one of their

56
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,810
colleagues or senior managers or

57
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,400
something like that but they probably

58
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,879
wouldn't report it however in our

59
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,470
research we actually discovered that

60
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,390
basically senior people in an

61
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:45,060
organization can do pretty much anything

62
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,700
and nobody would report them which was

63
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,769
incredible and in fact the only people

64
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:52,319
that colleagues were sort of feel felt

65
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,019
comfortable to report at all were

66
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:57,480
contractors they were really happy to

67
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,250
report contractors but everybody else

68
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,230
they were just like no I'm not reporting

69
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,299
that so it just kind of goes to show

70
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:05,970
that you know you might think oh yes

71
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,139
everyone would report something

72
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:09,750
suspicious but the reality is they

73
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,549
probably I mean pretty interesting like

74
00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:16,109
why do you think people are happy to

75
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:18,870
report contractors I think partly

76
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,940
because they're not really seen as part

77
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,810
of the tribe and as such it feels like

78
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,019
well if I go and report him I'm less

79
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:31,199
likely to be labeled as a snitch or you

80
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:33,720
know someone who can't be trusted

81
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,190
whereas if I do that with one of my

82
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,739
colleagues then this might become very

83
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:40,290
uncomfortable for me in my job going

84
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,000
forward and say for that reason I think

85
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,419
just weighing up the costs versus the

86
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:48,120
the benefits I think it's sort of skewed

87
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,340
in favor of staying quiet for the most

88
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,560
part yeah I mean that don't make Center

89
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,109
esting that the other side that I think

90
00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:00,479
insider threats for me he's worried

91
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:03,750
about is just the sheer access that I

92
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,799
really have do you think Sabich Rama

93
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:10,260
although the rather the open ask crime

94
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,659
was going to leverage this more and more

95
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:16,139
I mean we're singing inside a threat

96
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:18,120
increase exponentially I mean even if

97
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,668
you just look at the media over the last

98
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:23,430
two years reports have gone up hugely in

99
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,650
terms of sort of stealing intellectual

100
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,480
property stealing trades

101
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,280
secrets that sort of thing in my

102
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,740
experience insiders typically are going

103
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,000
for information that's really valuable

104
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,580
so probably customer personal

105
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,130
information is not that valuable in this

106
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:42,150
context it's more trade secrets business

107
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,180
plans client lists things like that that

108
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,030
can be traded both to competitors but

109
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,910
also on the dark web or you know to

110
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:53,160
other governments potentially depending

111
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,500
on the industry you work in and I think

112
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,660
the reason it's we've seen such an

113
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,210
increase isn't think about it back in

114
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,650
the day if you wanted to go and steal

115
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,170
information from your employer you would

116
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,110
have to go and sign the paper record

117
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:09,120
photocopy it put it in your bag then

118
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,220
somehow get it physically to somebody

119
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:11,820
else

120
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,370
now it's as simple as taking a

121
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,890
photograph on your phone as the screen

122
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:19,380
and and then sending that through a

123
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,950
message almost instantly to anyone in

124
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:26,880
the world really yeah you know in its in

125
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,400
it's so powerful because the amount of

126
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,310
data that can be stolen now boggles the

127
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,340
mind you know and in recently there was

128
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:40,080
a u.s. indictment handed down of a he

129
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,790
was an American citizen but he was a

130
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:44,900
Chinese descent copied literally

131
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,840
terabytes of sensitive information to a

132
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,840
harddrive and was basically intercepted

133
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,000
at the airport but terabytes of

134
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,580
information in this day and age on a

135
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,190
credit card sized device it's not

136
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:02,550
uncommon you know and it's a quick as

137
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:05,130
well and what's amazing what's amazing

138
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:09,600
to me is that you know why the USB ports

139
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,790
weren't disabled by a group policy

140
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:14,220
object or a piece of third-party

141
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,920
software it is really beyond me I mean

142
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,810
this seems to be like really basic are

143
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,970
you encountering these sort of basic

144
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:23,280
failures of security like on a regular

145
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,290
basis yeah I mean it is pretty they're

146
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,660
often very basic things that get the you

147
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,640
know so we've got wrong I think one of

148
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,260
the problems we have is that so years

149
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,050
and years and years companies especially

150
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,660
have wanted this really open kind of

151
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,090
welcoming atmosphere for that start and

152
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:45,040
they want everything open and sharing

153
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,610
and so on and so forth right and I think

154
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:49,690
you know that's that's a lovely

155
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:51,490
sentiment however it kind of does run

156
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,800
counter to security in some situations

157
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,900
and even if you've locked everything

158
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,210
down you know I walk around some of my

159
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,980
clients who are banks and they've got

160
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,450
all that stuff with their personal

161
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:04,510
mobile phone sitting on the desk so if

162
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,880
you think about it if you're picking up

163
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,190
your phone and you're videoing or

164
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:12,100
photographing the screen what's going to

165
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,600
detect that other than other members of

166
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,140
staff yeah and did the other thing I've

167
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:20,320
seen iPhone is like one of the arguments

168
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,590
as I but we vetted them and to me that

169
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:27,280
just doesn't always pan out I mean we

170
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,700
have the likes of the NSA who obviously

171
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,620
know a lot about people and they still

172
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,840
get beat by insider threats so what's

173
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,450
your advice to companies though how do

174
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:42,340
they help prevent I think actually it's

175
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,660
sort of an agreement with you I think

176
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:48,100
actually vulnerable because through

177
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,680
starts you know most companies you know

178
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,320
I don't have the ability to put people

179
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,210
through a lie-detector tests and a whole

180
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:58,060
new way right it's not reasonable to do

181
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,460
that employment law isn't going to look

182
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,260
very kindly on a lot of those sorts of

183
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:05,740
things so you've got this point in time

184
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:09,310
of sort of a document that apparently

185
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,990
gives you a sort of tick or cross

186
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,960
against an individual but obviously

187
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,970
things happen in people's lives and they

188
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,070
move jobs and so yes you might be

189
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,780
cleared for one job but as you get

190
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,850
promoted we'll get more access your

191
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:24,640
lifestyle changes you know how is that

192
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,690
sort of recorded and risk assessed so I

193
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,520
think actually if you're over reliant on

194
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,289
national vetting you're probably more

195
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:35,409
London ago Israel yeah I think that's a

196
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:37,690
really great point and then also the

197
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,580
revisiting of the vetting to like

198
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,460
circumstances change like you said you

199
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,229
know and you know person keep going

200
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:46,510
through ugly domestic matter or fall

201
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:49,000
into debt all sorts of things could

202
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,339
change their risk profile and you know

203
00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:53,320
if you're assessing that only

204
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,020
a five-year cycle for for secret

205
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:00,430
clearance or DV clearance as you call it

206
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,830
in the UK you know you could miss an

207
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:06,490
insider threat for four years well

208
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:12,700
exactly I was fine but there were lots

209
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,290
of other things that were slagged up

210
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:16,420
through different departments that

211
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,480
weren't brought back to the central

212
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,800
department that deals with lists of

213
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,110
clearances had they done that they would

214
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,310
have they would have known well in

215
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,580
advance that this was a big red flag so

216
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,440
also they needed a security guard that

217
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,260
really liked Katy Perry and would be oh

218
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:40,380
man Katy Perry that's not Katy Perry

219
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,040
question is that so anyone's Nona wasn't

220
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:52,540
a direct employee of the NSA yes so so

221
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,610
how does that actually benefit into

222
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,410
things as well how do you vet

223
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:58,960
contractors I think I think it's very

224
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,460
difficult and you know I think one of

225
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:03,130
the things that companies are starting

226
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:04,840
to realize and I think more so in the

227
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,270
u.s. than in Europe but in is motoring

228
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:10,600
down in the culture in Europe as well is

229
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,540
that actually when you hire a third

230
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,730
party you're relying on them having

231
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:19,390
vetted their staff who then come into

232
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:22,840
your organization yeah and actually some

233
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,790
of the projects are rushed through so

234
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,680
the vetting is Russian as a result as

235
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,450
well and I think you know naturally

236
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,780
there's going to be mistakes and

237
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,880
certainly for clients that generates a

238
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,300
lot of intellectual property or sort of

239
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,480
financial houses I think there's very

240
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,150
very serious risk here but this

241
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:46,390
information could be exfiltrated there's

242
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,640
a lot of this criminally so from from

243
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,560
the UK law enforcement I know like the

244
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,620
Americans have a very open system they

245
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,300
have the public access to court records

246
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,630
system and regular press releases on

247
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:01,150
espionage related stuff and cybercrime

248
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,670
related stuff in the UK this seems to be

249
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:06,490
very close hold is there a lot of stuff

250
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:06,760
that

251
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,000
going on that isn't reported or doesn't

252
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,220
make the news and is handled you know in

253
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:15,450
the British tradition of hush-hush

254
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:18,460
potentially I think the other problem in

255
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,320
the UK says to me when I was in law

256
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,150
enforcement one of the problems that we

257
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,470
had was that people just weren't

258
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:26,950
reporting cybercrime and I think if you

259
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:27,910
think about it for a moment it's an

260
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:30,360
inside of stole information that wasn't

261
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,310
personally identifiable information

262
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:35,170
there would be no actual obligation to

263
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:37,720
report to anybody right okay you don't

264
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,370
have to report it to the ICA so if you

265
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:44,640
lose our secret Death Star plans exactly

266
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,470
you know is it better to stay quiet I

267
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:50,160
mean from your share prices perspective

268
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,660
I'm not sure you'd want to announce that

269
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,180
someone has stolen that and I think you

270
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,350
know if you look at the companies that

271
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:59,410
had insider threat manifest and this

272
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:03,370
become public they've had hugely

273
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,320
devastating us effects to their share

274
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,060
price and to their public reputation

275
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,090
almost more so then it had been an

276
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:12,520
outsider attacking them so are you

277
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,170
familiar with the Morrison's case not in

278
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:20,290
in great detail but yes yes so the idea

279
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:22,630
there is and I love this case because I

280
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,030
think it's probably the coolest thing so

281
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,520
you have a person that's dealing drugs

282
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,850
at work right yes ostensibly a criminal

283
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:34,800
matter right however in order to I guess

284
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,560
repay the drug debt the individual has

285
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,220
been stealing sensitive information from

286
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,100
the company's payroll system okay

287
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,830
so now you have an IC o---- privacy

288
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,870
investigation because the sensitive data

289
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:53,370
was was was lifted right yes so

290
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:56,170
Morrison's decides that they're not

291
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,450
going to settle with the employees who

292
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,910
launched a class action saying hey this

293
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:04,780
drug-dealing criminal guy sold our data

294
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:09,190
to fuel his drug empire desires we're

295
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:09,730
suing you

296
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:13,420
Morrison turns around and says no we're

297
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:16,150
not we're gonna go to court they go to

298
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:18,820
court they lose they go to the Court of

299
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,260
Appeals of a low

300
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,720
I think the matter is going to be solved

301
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,420
sometime in 2020 or 20 21 in front of

302
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,540
the Supreme Court the problem here is we

303
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,510
have an issue now where if more since

304
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,130
it's held accountable for the actions

305
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:38,080
the criminal actions of an employee at

306
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,870
that point you know we're blowing

307
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,790
privacy out of the water because now we

308
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,980
need to monitor our employees behavior

309
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,470
for criminal activities I just want to

310
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:50,410
add sorry I think it was really

311
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:52,240
important to this to add that that

312
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,570
employee had a ready access to his job

313
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:59,530
yes the information he was in order to

314
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:02,460
write I think it was eclectic

315
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,210
interesting point though about class

316
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,610
action we don't really know about class

317
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:09,820
action in the UK much apart from what we

318
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,760
read that's happening in the u.s. class

319
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,070
action is a pretty needy reaction to any

320
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:17,770
major incident whereby lawyers will pile

321
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,540
on everybody that's involved and go

322
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,270
ahead guys let's Club together and sue

323
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:25,060
the [ __ ] out of the company but I think

324
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,380
what we found with class action is that

325
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,240
the people at the very end of it ie

326
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,860
victims generally get pennies so I want

327
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,570
to hear Lisa's thoughts on this one

328
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:36,850
because I think they're just a position

329
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:42,310
of criminal and privacy and holding the

330
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:44,500
business accountable is kind of a neat

331
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,990
area where I think you might have some

332
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:52,810
great insight yeah so I think at

333
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:56,950
university masters in law so in law is

334
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:00,900
sort of my thing generally speaking if

335
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,490
during the course of employment whilst

336
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,680
you're actually on duty s to see you do

337
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,410
something then traditionally in the UK

338
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,150
employers would be vicariously liable

339
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:13,090
for those acts and the only way you

340
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:14,980
would get out of that is if you could

341
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,960
prove that the employee was effectively

342
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,510
off on a frolic of his own somewhere

343
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:21,190
else and you had no knowledge or

344
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:23,260
reasonable belief you know you could

345
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:26,770
detect it sort of thing the premium here

346
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:29,200
was fact that Mike was running a drug

347
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:29,900
empire

348
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:35,260
from his from its from his company

349
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:38,779
actually you might be able to reasonably

350
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:42,560
detectives that might was doing some

351
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,839
abnormal savings and potentially

352
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:47,000
exfiltrating data that confirm thing

353
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,400
that would be within your control okay

354
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,770
so in that aspect I don't I don't

355
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:54,050
disagree with with the judgment however

356
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,120
what's kind of interesting is that

357
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,580
concurrently in the UK there's been a

358
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,250
very big movement especially by the

359
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,370
courts to and in the EU generally

360
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:08,180
actually to really strike down any sort

361
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,370
of aggressive employee monitoring and

362
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,230
they've really really been very strict

363
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,880
in this and they've said it's really not

364
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,160
acceptable unless you can prove that it

365
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,320
is proportionate and necessary

366
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,170
so the aim you're trying to achieve but

367
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,690
so it's something that I think is going

368
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:26,510
to cause a lot of ripples in the

369
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:29,080
industry generally within within the EU

370
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,790
because you know monitoring all your

371
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:35,060
staff everything they do I don't think

372
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,459
will work anymore in an employment

373
00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:40,250
tribunal it had also come though it also

374
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,770
comes down to monitoring employees and

375
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:44,540
this is where I always feel that you

376
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,390
should monitor behaviors so is that

377
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,740
something you agree with so you don't

378
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,970
actually want it to the employee you

379
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:54,020
monitor their behaviors yeah I mean I

380
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,370
think it would come down to how

381
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,680
intrusive that was for example we have I

382
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,810
recently read about a case with someone

383
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,880
a company had bring-your-own-device

384
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,609
and the action monitored activity on the

385
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:08,420
employees own devices which was deemed

386
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:11,510
excessive and and and ruled that you

387
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,189
were not able to do that but typically

388
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:15,770
they said things like you know being

389
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:18,079
able to monitor certain private

390
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,429
messaging accounts and things like that

391
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:22,099
employees you it's not okay so I think

392
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:23,540
you have to tread really carefully and I

393
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,449
and I personally feel that the best way

394
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:28,640
to tackle this is again going back to

395
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,050
the same thing that you always say the

396
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,929
security is working out where your

397
00:17:32,929 --> 00:17:36,170
assets are that an insider might want to

398
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:38,690
steal if they exist in your company and

399
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,710
then monitoring just those employees as

400
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,190
opposed to your

401
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:48,890
tire cohort or start right right yeah

402
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,150
Wow

403
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:52,700
so much to get our heads around on this

404
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,370
Lisa and I could talk to you about like

405
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,650

406
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,090
enforcement background and that

407
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:02,810
