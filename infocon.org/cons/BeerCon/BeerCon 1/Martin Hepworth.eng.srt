2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:05,910
the massive head west

welcome to bear com1 thank you very much

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,280

well let the audience decide they are

8
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,050
the the ultimate judge in these things

9
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,109
indeed Martin just spend a minute or two

10
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:24,740
telling us who you are and what you do

11
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:30,300
Who am I I'm practicing sysadmin and

12
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,910
reformed programmer for a smallest

13
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,460
medium-sized Australian software house

14
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,550
and I help run business outside of all

15
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,390
the struggling stuff

16
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:53,210
Oh so how did you get into emphasis um

17
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,379
look I've been into this ugly noise

18
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:58,469
don't think you can avoid it myself I'm

19
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:00,809
kind of first experienced bit from a

20
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:03,030
hard point of view when I was a student

21
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,570
and one of the many many decades ago and

22
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,380
one of the guys there was the ultimate

23
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,080
what the archetypal I don't think you

24
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,549
had a black study but yeah it was

25
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:21,360
thought he had the person who was on two

26
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,429
passwords on bacteria metal as amended

27
00:01:23,429 --> 00:01:25,950
member leigh.m a yeah both randomly

28
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,590
generated 32 characters alphanumeric and

29
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,850
special character strings that you

30
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,470
remembered in his head because it was

31
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,940
really small and and he was the one that

32
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,259
was also getting banned off the system

33
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,179
before to exert John because he done got

34
00:01:42,179 --> 00:01:44,250
into areas that we shouldn't have that

35
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,600
was my kind of like experience of seeing

36
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,909
it live as it were that was back in the

37
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:55,610
Middle Ages but yeah then as a sysadmin

38
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:59,399
programmer at first and then into

39
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,560
mother-to-child inside I don't think

40
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,250
that being in the industry info Seki

41
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,360
cybersecurity whatever you want to call

42
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,580
it this week I don't think you can avoid

43
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,720
it really it's part and parcel of the

44
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,550
whole IT industry so sysadmin as a title

45
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:20,160
as a role I think that's kind of become

46
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,750
a little bit of a misnomer over the

47
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,800
years I don't really agree with that

48
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,500
it's old-school yeah

49
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:32,790
it's Weidman we say the term used we do

50
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,920
in my place work we have assist admins

51
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,989
but here's the funny thing they're kind

52
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:39,540
of a bit more than that right so they

53
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,180
are people that build things okay they

54
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,099
don't just administer and look after and

55
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:46,430
food and water systems and they actually

56
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,920
manufacture systems my experience and

57
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,900
that can be full stack that can be

58
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,640
anything from spinning up a server and

59
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,590
drop it in or subnet organizing the

60
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,450
firewall real journeys and actually

61
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,540
applying them

62
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,890
and all the rest of it is that something

63
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,959
that you do get involved in that level

64
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:04,209
or it is working for a smaller company

65
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:10,659
you don't have the opportunity needs to

66
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:13,599
have the requirements to have a

67
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,790
dedicated network team was dedicated by

68
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:22,299
well listen even if you have to have a

69
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:27,480
wide knowledge that gives you it's not a

70
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,370
double P of the aspect of like a ping

71
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,780
joke that you have to have something

72
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,150
that a mile widen and interesting so you

73
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,169
need to know a little bit about

74
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:46,239
everything and for me that what did we

75
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,609
lose you mind I think we made a large

76
00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:53,889
man but network difficulties yeah but

77
00:03:53,889 --> 00:03:56,260
but while we were in for mine and there

78
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,329
was one thing I wanted to comment on and

79
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:03,150
I think it's really encouraging that the

80
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,590
the man I mentioned that he's an for

81
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:10,349
sysadmin but you can't get away from oh

82
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:13,870
yeah and from an imperfect point of view

83
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,959
as well if you're constantly needs to

84
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,620
keep your knowledge up to a level you

85
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,020
know what's happening wherever the

86
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,659
current threats from how does that

87
00:04:25,659 --> 00:04:27,970
affect the systems that I'm responsible

88
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:32,680
for and that then goes back to him what

89
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,630
systems I'm are responsible for and

90
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,810
what's on those systems that you talking

91
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,000
about going back that basics at the top

92
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,610
then cool

93
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,680
so one thing I was just going to add

94
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,240
that the fact that you mention it yes

95
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,409
Esserman you can't get away from

96
00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:54,970
infestation I think that's really

97
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:58,770
encouraging that it shows that people

98
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,960
are thinking about emphasis acuity even

99
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,940
though it's not their core

100
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,440
responsibility do you notice many others

101
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,389
with a similar sort of thinking um yeah

102
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:11,980
I think

103
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,170
there's another group that I'm involved

104
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:20,020
with the mostess admin side this is

105
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,760
quite a web community nno there's a

106
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,500
couple of folks around here that's been

107
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,220
involved with out in the past and again

108
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:32,980
it's it's the wider you know you're not

109
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:39,870
stuck necessarily in one technology and

110
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:43,480
but it's going back to an intersect

111
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:48,520
point of view on that still needs back

112
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,360
specialist help at certain points so you

113
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,040
might not be blessed that you might not

114
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,740
be an IPS expert if you've got an owner

115
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,570
to be able to work your way through

116
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:04,810
through that social engineering so you

117
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:07,210
can help educate and I know Scott was

118
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:09,790
talking about that a lot there's that

119
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,770
education piece in there as well it's

120
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,900
not just teaching how to someone to use

121
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,030
how to use Excel or whatever they're

122
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:21,370
doing is looking at what risk are we

123
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:26,110
seeing coming in what how can we help

124
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:29,380
people identify those risk and how can

125
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:37,000
we help the wider community identify

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,010
them deal with them so that we're not

127
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:39,970
falling for it

128
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:42,190
a lot of it the awareness training that

129
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,440
that I do and I'm gonna do one in it in

130
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,200
their back three days at work

131
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,110
I don't concentrate on well we're gonna

132
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,450
see this with this technical risk or

133
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:55,230
whatever I look at it from a wider

134
00:06:55,230 --> 00:07:00,040
stance of how can we uplift society in

135
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,230
general so I'm sorry

136
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:05,710
the risks are talking about auntie Mabel

137
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,870
getting romance scams from this nice

138
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,550
gentle nice-looking gentleman from

139
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:12,730
victory and how would they thought

140
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,920
they'd think the things that Auntie

141
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,170
Martin Mabel might be talking about or

142
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:22,090
not talking about changes oceans I can

143
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:25,400
spot issues around

144
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,240
your family your friends how you can

145
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,240
educate them to spot you know why is

146
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,699
that why is DHL sending me a delivery

147
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:40,550
notes or a returns notes holding sort of

148
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,199
things that we're seeing I ran where the

149
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:45,260
scanners which is what they are at them

150
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:49,370
today the crooks are trying to get money

151
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:53,080
out of us for whatever reasons

152
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:57,560
intracellular that a large part of my

153
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,500
role within once I drop into buying but

154
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:05,210
that can't it's not just looking at the

155
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,070
technical risk but if your thing is

156
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:11,330
upgrading maturing the patch it's

157
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,639
looking at the wider scans that was

158
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:17,900
saying going on around it and so talking

159
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:22,280
to some of the social engineers some of

160
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:26,300
the and the rock original the most crime

161
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:30,229
units in the UK and some of the despite

162
00:08:30,229 --> 00:08:34,339
the unit's from local police forces over

163
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:38,208
here what are they seeing so that we can

164
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:40,458
start to let people know this one

165
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:45,020
slightly different it still basically a

00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:20,870
so that you know they've been talking to

220
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:23,060
an actual bank employee I mean they

221

00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,560
when they're in New York to vote either

226
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,270
to you but had can you vote by the

227
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,880
defense or how can you verify that it's

228
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,290
the little literature that you're

229
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,820
dealing with you might not necessarily

230
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,890
recognize the voices each one of the one

231
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:45,130
of the fat yeah do you think people's

232
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:47,180
personalities and they come into it also

233
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,040
a maybe parts culture so I know in the

234
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,589
UK we often try our be as polite as we

235
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:52,760
can

236
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,520
so perhaps people are about worried

237
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,350
about offending people on the other line

238
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,320
like how they worried that the personal

239
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,870
my alarm I think that they'd just be

240
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,370
rude or something like that do you think

241
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:09,910
that has some impact I think so under

242
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,080
the scammers tend to go on the fear

243
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:16,040
factor so your yeah and emergency

I think I'm mr. Fang from from a work

279
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:57,820
point of view as well you know the CEO

00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,450
a factor of the authority circle

285
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:12,350
potentially but also that that

286
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:15,869
[Music]

287
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:30,349

microwaves are passionate what he never

289
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,280
wakes women salami on x-factor that

290
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:39,620
everything immediate and and explaining

291
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,680
less people in some time in a funny way

292
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:47,780
I also when I'm doing the PowerPoint see

293
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,640
just becomes a talking points so I

294
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,750
talked about upgrading

295
00:14:53,470 --> 00:15:01,020
oh look

296
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:04,340
made of Austin

297
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,189
a bit or maybe it's me

298
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:13,440
I mean your systems and so on but I've

299
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,600
still two years later I get still people

300
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:35,390
kill me this little dog patch so thing

301
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:48,500
well but it is all about getting the

302
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,600
conversation going as well I find it's

303
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,300
um okay I'm trying to try and be a

304
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,460
little bit silly I know there's other

305
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,080
people in the industry that do this

306
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,460
often but when I'm giving talks I get

307
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,010
interaction I'm trying Sweetbay it keeps

308
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:02,850
people awake

309
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:05,160
and it and it also again here you might

310
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,480
feel a bit more fun than them to sit

311
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,220
through you know two hours of PowerPoint

312
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,860
yeah so we lost you for a little bit

313
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,630
there but I think we got the gist of

314
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,580
where you were coming from and I think

315
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,670
you know the innovation the use of humor

316
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:23,970
to try and get that positive

317
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:25,920
reinforcement and that positive

318
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:31,500
awareness is key is absolutely key it's

319
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,730
making me miss just making it funny

320
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,080
things are a little bit fun they're not

321
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,180
destler boring people are going to

322
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,220
engage a little bit more and then

323
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,930
they're going to come to you with the

324
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:44,040
question and if they don't fall for

325
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,460
things it's human don't blame them you

326
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,820
know help them out and you're not going

327
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,340
to get a negative reaction or a hidden

328
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,890

338
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,310
smart so you can ask you a question um

339
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,359
you mentioned earlier about your

340
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,369
dealings with lab

341
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:24,260
organized crime units not kind of stuff

342
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,410
and collaboration with law enforcement

343
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:29,200
generally how how are you finding that

344
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,250
something I do a little bit all in my

345
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,710
role but are you finding there's a good

346
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:36,110
sharing of information culture happening

347
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:38,570
or is a resistance in places how's it

348
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:43,250
working for you um yeah it can be quite

349
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,420
sure to get hold of someone that you've

350
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,309
got active something active going on at

351
00:17:46,309 --> 00:17:51,260
the time the the rottens have been on

352
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,870
earth because the months have been a bit

353
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:57,679
more active on social media there's this

354
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,410
thing in there you show that the N th o

355
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:04,700
n CFC is taken over every single and Gi

356
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:09,730
Gi XP that you can join but again that's

357
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:12,559
quite fitted to join as a community you

358
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,170
have got to get a sponsor so you've got

359
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,280
know someone who's already in the

360
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:21,190
community to get community I still

361
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:26,720
comment and say how do I get on do it I

362
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:32,750
go yeah and I get the fact that they

363
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,900
need to keep the content you know I

364
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,170
don't know keep the specialized I think

365
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:42,800
that specializes yes I mean cispr I'm a

366
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,170
member of it and I remember probably 18

367
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,490
months ago logging into it for the first

368
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:50,559
time and it was a barren wasteland yeah

369
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:54,860
tend to be quite quiet a lot of the

370
00:18:54,860 --> 00:19:01,220
local government and yeah it did

371
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:04,130
yeah it seemed to me that when I first

372
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:05,360
logged in it was basically there were a

373
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,460
few published articles by the NCSC and

374
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:11,000
that was it okay and then when one a cry

375
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,210
happened we suddenly saw two things

376
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:16,580
happen a massive influx of new members

377
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,760
and the hell of a lot more actual

378
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,890
information sharing so now when you log

379
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:25,040
into sis CIA SP you do tend to find it's

380
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,110
actually got some good stuff happening

381
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,610
in there and you'll see probably quite a

382
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:32,660
few people you recognize yeah I think

383
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:35,179
he's definitely grown I'm not quite sure

384
00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:36,019
how we can

385
00:19:36,019 --> 00:19:38,419
encourage that growth it is obviously

386
00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:46,940
very you care specifically that this

387
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,320
excuse the pun policing of the

388
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,789
membership so that it keeps it in case

389
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:55,249
specific fitness but then he provides

390
00:19:55,249 --> 00:19:58,070
some barrier to entry you don't get your

391
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,740
company on it yeah but it's definitely

392
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,249
getting better

393
00:20:01,249 --> 00:20:03,169
and I think that sort of thing should be

394
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:04,399
encouraged but we'll need to think about

395
00:20:04,399 --> 00:20:07,039
ways of how can we get more people onto

396
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:12,470
that program if people want to need to

397
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:13,580
get on that board like to get the

398
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,559
program there in the UK they'd like to

399
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:18,289
get their organisation sponsors onto it

400
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:20,720
