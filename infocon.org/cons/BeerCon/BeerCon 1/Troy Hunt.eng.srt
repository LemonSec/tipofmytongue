1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,049
all right well welcome back and we are

2
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:08,340
just incredibly lucky to get going on in

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:23,580
his mobile command post just fantastic

4
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,760
so Troy thank you so much for being part

5
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,060
of this fear com1 and lending your your

6
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,850
brand and your help to the Forbes

7
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,160
article with Kade that was just

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,000
tremendous what do we need to know about

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,850
2019 what are sort of the key takeaways

10
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,390
from your perspective especially on I

11
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:47,340
know the data for each issue are we

12
00:00:47,340 --> 00:01:06,360
really bad at cloud yes sort of thing

13
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,520
but it also makes it easier to screw

14
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,200
stuff up fast all we've ever done before

15
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,310
as well I think one of the big things we

16
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,950
sort of saw during this year was the

17
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,740
agency not exist to the majors would be

18
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,460
great like large aggregate of these

19
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,900
organizations that I've never heard

20
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,619
before and then suddenly it's like yeah

21
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:30,150
here's X number of hundreds of millions

22
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:39,750
of accounts they've got data that is

23
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,509
facilitated by the ubiquity cheaper

24
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:46,560
easily accessible crowd yeah and and

25
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,710
he's also it's like do you feel this is

26
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,950
sort of the last gasps of of you know

27
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,450
data in the hands of folks that just are

28
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,960
not putting any protection in are you

29
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,909
seeing an impact from data protection

30
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:10,860
laws like GDP are you know in terms of

31
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,850
being a last-gasp but I think

32
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,830
what we're just saying now is a new

33
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,050
normal I mean that the whole premise of

34
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,640
somehow being able to have control over

35
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,280
your bathroom certainly as it relates to

36
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,010
to sort of by individual attributes I

37
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,060
mean let's say there's the sort of stuff

38
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,410
that gets scraped I think in all the

39
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,900
other places we really don't really need

40
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,910
control over that I think it's just a

41
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,860
combination of so much gardening at a

42
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:36,040
cheap to stand up and doctoral self can

43
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,360
catch a valuable commodity but they

44
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,970
don't know is agent in ante up now you

45
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,040
know that certainly happened and then as

46
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,380
it relates to the rights of GDP are

47
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,920
coming legislation which is for my

48
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,680
privacy the problem is it really doesn't

49
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,520
have much teeth as it relates to

50
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,070
operating in the u.s. right one of the

51
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:10,380
things I really learn in Tibet anyway

52
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,700
there's just sort of different views of

53
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,230
the rights and try and seize them

54
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,260
individual in real world but the other

55
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,360
thing as well as the chances of an India

56
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,880
regulator to be going over to some state

57
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:27,460
us from vino-antica just frankly not

58
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,650
very good yeah it's sort of interesting

59
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:33,760
to see the feedback from local

60
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,740
regulators in the EU and people tried to

61
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:40,000
go to town multiple messages from people

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,260
where the regulator said look basically

63
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:45,250
as of now it's just you're a different

64
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,740
story if it's like right right if it's

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,040
so and you bring up a really valid point

66
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,370
in that you know global companies with

67
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,960
their incredible reach and their

68
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,200
incredible power you know I think

69
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,620
Australia and Canada and some other

70
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,690
countries have attempted to take them to

71
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:15,670
task but it seems like you know when

72
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,238
they have a five billion dollar bank

73
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:21,279
account that they've already allocated

74
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,420
to fines does it feel little good

75
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,840
see generous that hope they're taking

76
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,840
your privacy seriously they're prepared

77
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,440
to pay any fine that the planet can in

78
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,130
hand them I think this is just one of

79
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:50,740
these things very Jeanette's a backward

80
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,110
you know these bastards are going and

81
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,130
they're selling it and then when it's

82
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,270
wide even everything remember the other

83
00:04:55,270 --> 00:05:04,720
hand so we run the risk of just being a

84
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,910
little bit more if we pick too much from

85
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:11,200
one side from my perspective almost like

86
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,240
to put a pig let's dance a nutria party

87
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,890
and go with there there are different

88
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,750
angles to this I can see the different

89
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,730
sides of the argument and the right

90
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,200
answer probably lies somewhere in the

91
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,570
middle of the extremes between that the

92
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,430
privacy side of things and an effect of

93
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,290
people directly access the search I

94
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,360
think it's really great that you're

95
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,600
talking about this because I know that

96
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,070
Australia and other countries are

97
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,980
looking at trying to institute some sort

98
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:39,310
of crypto logical backdoor I would

99
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:42,580
imagine that you're pretty adamant that

100
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,290
there is no such thing as a

101
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,900
cryptological backdoor that wouldn't be

102
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,960
abused by a religious doctrine is that

103
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,910
something is that a position that you're

104
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:57,790
advocating for really publicly what I'm

105
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,890
saying in terms are there usually two

106
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:02,230
ends of the extreme and the reality is

107
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:10,450
somewhere in between yeah basically the

108
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,430
government saying hey there's a lot of

109
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,040
cryptography out there these days

110
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,660
bad people curse better policies sort of

111
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,970
thing have the ability to go through and

112
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:22,450
have communication with Gregory than

113
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:23,710
ever before and it actually makes it

114
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,780
really hard to the veg job and when you

115
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,640
sort of listen to it in that perspective

116
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,770
and go yeah actually I can see that we

117
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:32,080
really have and I like sitting back and

118
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,000
all these sorts of things it's like okay

119
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,920
there's one side

120
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,810
and then of course the other side of the

121
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,530
exam is that we all want privacy I want

122
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:43,920
to be able to talk about everything from

123
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,129
[Music]

124
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,790
community graphic systems puts them at

125
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:56,510
risk it varies in terms of Australia as

126
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,760
well sort of seen the government saying

127
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,380
absolutely ridiculous stuff we heard our

128
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,760
prime minister at the time saying

129
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,090
Australia's ban publicly or banning

130
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,860
security and that's be equal as well the

131
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,050
government's existence that we do not

132
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:20,240
want to wait good

133
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,640
so what does that leave does that leave

134
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:29,990
with appropriately going to actually see

135
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:33,980
cases where communications there's many

136
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,770
areas due process and it's not going to

137
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,330
be weekly encryption it might business

138
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,250
they get access to the device maybe they

139
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,380
get access to a device back up an apple

140
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:45,500
for example now of course they're not

141
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,610
going to talk about exactly what it

142
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:56,150
looks like given what they do the

143
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,790
discussion when I think these need to be

144
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,290
part of the discussion but how they help

145
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:02,240
law enforcement but it's not going to be

146
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,120
writing a fictional backdoors and it's

147
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,320
also not going to be doing nothing

148
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,820
either because we do want to protect you

149
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,200
that's right

150
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,419
yeah it's that whole juxtaposition

151
00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:13,790
between national security and privacy

152
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:18,020
that that causes governments to look

153
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:21,530
very duplicity in a lot of cases moving

154
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:25,340
to I guess a big project of yours have I

155
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:29,390
been pawned you are in the process of

156
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,580
divesting yourself from how I've been

157
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,900
pawned

158
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,719
is it sort of like seeing your child go

159
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:38,780
off to college or what what is sort of

160
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,909
what are you what are you feeling this

161
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:42,289
around that because it's been a huge

162
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:45,400
part of your life yeah

163
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,779
[Music]

164
00:08:51,760 --> 00:09:18,069
that's still ongoing that I'm happy with

165
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:37,490
it's one thing the fun I got and you

166
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:40,760
know what thanks for clarifying I think

167
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:45,170
there's a fair amount of of unease above

168
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:48,589
that and certainly a service that

169
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:51,170
governments now and large companies and

170
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,779
small companies are relying on and I

171
00:09:53,779 --> 00:09:55,760
guess you know there's that sense that

172
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,700
that maybe the carpets gonna be tugged

173
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,190
out a bit so I think I appreciate that

174
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:04,820
assurance now as a private problems the

175
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:08,300
world all sorts of different things you

176
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:33,620
seem to be very friendly security as

177
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,510
well and look it's just a really cool

178
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,250
chilled out base a lot of friends there

179
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,380
it's really accessible to the rest of

180
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,089
Europe so that's that's sort of maybe

181
00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:44,839
the central place to comment and look

182
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:46,070
them in that that's another thing I'll

183
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:48,769
talk much more about the future okay

184
00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:51,380
well that's really really exciting do

185
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,180
you see like obviously from your

186
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,690
perspective when you get to travel all

187
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:59,620
four places any sort of one area or

188
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,860
region being a little bit more

189
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,770
progressive sighting when it comes to

190
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:09,520
cybersecurity or you Tennessee it's the

191
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,320
perspective change we're just struggling

192
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:19,180
everywhere I went to Israel for the

193
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,950
first time this year actually in Israel

194
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:24,430
is a real hotbed in firstly gladly

195
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,170
exchange because everyone in Israel has

196
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:27,760
to go through an extra service if I

197
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,530
build out so I'm really really strong in

198
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:31,360
place like abilities s there are a lot

199
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,630
of big security companies of Israel so I

200
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,660
went to inspect the conference there and

201
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,490
was to in july some whereabouts and

202
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,110
spend a bunch of time visiting the

203
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,090
organizations as well so I I found that

204
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:45,010
quite fascinating and of course there in

205
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:48,250
a part of the world where the military

206
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,490
and defense which is becoming closer and

207
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:54,760
closer to dare we say cyber cyber

208
00:11:54,760 --> 00:12:10,300
security that's cool was their sense of

209
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:15,550
sort of discovering friendships and

210
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:28,810
relationships because they know that and

211
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:32,140
particularly a little bit is really

212
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,600
welcome I'm literally sitting in a boat

213
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,190
in the middle of a harbor drinking beer

214
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:53,440
swimming with whole bunch of people it's

215
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,240
just really nice to take those sort of

216
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,490
online digital experiences and

217
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:02,170
tournaments that's fantastic so what is

218
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,759
your advice now

219
00:13:03,759 --> 00:14:28,699
just starting out so obviously I went to

220
00:14:28,699 --> 00:14:31,220
Def Con this year I didn't do a Def Con

221
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:36,820
[Music]

222
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:52,850
tort of plan that far ahead

223
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,639
other than a few sort of Kiev into and

224
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:58,509
really plan much

225
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:11,190
I never must go yeah and they say event

226
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:13,160
which again is right academic to my way

227
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,660
every year they this they look after

228
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,400
that the speak is amazing we're well

229
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,930
they're graduating so is it cool touch

230
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,960
the world so I'll be doing in DC

231
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,970
security in Oslo next month and then

232
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:26,820
straight up rather be doing in DC in

233
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:31,080
London and also for folks or those

234
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,310
places I'm gonna have my ten-year-old

235
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,680
son we're gonna be running a pub

236
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,870
together as well sorry as he sought he

237
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,760
gets a bit older and he showing real

238
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,200
interest in this industry as well and

239
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,870
I'm really excited about spending more

240
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,930
time with him at events and in giving

241
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:49,250
him the opportunity to do something well

242
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:55,050
he's his practice and Airlines frequent

243
00:15:55,050 --> 00:16:08,370
flyer members already this I think this

244
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:11,070
is a really really exciting you know

245
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:14,730
phase of life most of the energy kids

246
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:17,250
that have access to this so they gave it

247
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,550
depending on the London there's free

248
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,800
events just finished a security also or

249
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,500
in DC London and saw not bring good luck

250
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:41,520
fantastic there and sometimes things go

251
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:50,460
a little bit sideways the factor out of

252
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,520
your sample size not everyone is always

253
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,870
gonna be happy yeah how do you manage it

254
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,750
I think over the last couple of years

255
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,090
I've come to the realization that you're

256
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,040
never gonna keep everyone happy and if

257
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,599
you do you're probably pretty bloody

258
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:10,500
boring it's always become a major place

259
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,569
where everyone likes something I wasn't

260
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:15,230
actually any good

261
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:19,650
measure is but I'm okay with fragments

262
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,630
like like 1% of people being unhappiness

263
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:22,829
something I've said or something like

264
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:25,470
that so it's fun and it doesn't matter

265
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,510
what I can do the most wonderful thing

266
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:29,120
in the world something about said about

267
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,309
so that's like that I think for me that

268
00:17:32,309 --> 00:17:34,980
the difficulties is what happens when

269
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,350
it's yeah what happens if it's a 10% of

270
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,120
the feedback it is negative well then I

271
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,500
gotta sort of look at me oh hang on a

272
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,350
moment like this just my my country's

273
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:48,929
getting a little bit often across well

274
00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:51,540
and I've had to retract and sort of this

275
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,669
was my fault didn't sound really you

276
00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:56,280
know let me try and fix that so I think

277
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,780
a little bit of humility and acknowledge

278
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,890
you know sometimes you just kind of

279
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,690
screwed to get back as long I think

280
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:03,690
that's incredibly great advice and

281
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:10,380
certainly I think you as quite a leader

282
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,340
in the space and mentor so you know I

283
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,049
think that's really important to

284
00:18:16,049 --> 00:18:17,820
understand that well you know humans

285
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,620
behind the keyboards and at the end of

286
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,200
the day we're doing the best we can

287
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,559
um so I guess we're getting close to the

288
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:37,200
end I think just as my sort of general

289
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,850
observation for the for the year in life

290
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,410
in general I think it's just a really

291
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,830
fulfilling industry having tried

292
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:46,260
everyone to sort of get out there beyond

293
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:50,190
what is on the internet as well is

294
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:55,320
really reduced my Twitter and probably

295
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,380
increased my IRL politican now mind you

296
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,910
I get in trouble selecting people saying

297
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:02,130
killing the ozone but fine too much so

298
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:03,540
again you know we're gonna keep everyone

299
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:06,419
but I think actually going out and

300
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:08,760
having experiences with people is really

301
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,419
really valuable

302
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:11,160
I'm trying to sort of detach yourself

303
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,890
from you know 280 character discussions

304
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:16,230
through the yeah whether it be having a

305
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,150
beer or coffee or whatever you you think

306
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,980
of choice is actually having some some

307
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,169
social interaction the wonderful things

308
00:19:22,169 --> 00:19:25,200
are true and discussions happening

309
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,230
doesn't happen a lot yeah absolutely

310
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,030
do you think though they're just there's

311
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:32,700
been an improvement in the presses

312
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,740
coverage of information security issues

313
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,380
or do you kind of feel that they're they

314
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,430
still don't quite get it

315
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:52,760
Witek period Joseph drops weed Lorenzo

316
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,590
really really understand the industry

317
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,650
and great balance pieces I guess where

318
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:00,330
the big challenge comes is what about

319
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,340
the consumer facing media so what about

320
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:09,990
the stuff that my mum and dad read you

321
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:12,240
know through to the sybers how do they

322
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,010
represent please yeah and like the

323
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,240
immediate thing that comes to mind is

324
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,770
things like the Disney bus of countries

325
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:18,180
I remember in the news is real a few

326
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,340
weeks ago it was like Disney quest is

327
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,050
Hank you think Wes exactly and so well

328
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:24,420
actually a whole bunch of people chose

329
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,830
really bad passwords that they used

330
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,900
