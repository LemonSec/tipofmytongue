sure sure so my name is Dave Kennedy

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,410
I've been in the information security

21
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,780
space now for about 19 years but

22
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,130
everything from I used to work in the

23
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:00,200
military intelligence side I did two

24
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,960
tours in Iraq so a military veteran in

25
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,699
the Marine Corps doing intelligence

26
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:07,069
related missions to achieve security

27
00:01:07,069 --> 00:01:08,780
officer to Fortune 1000 company and then

28
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,329
I decided to start out of the base of my

29
00:01:11,329 --> 00:01:13,789
house two companies trucks it's a

30
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:17,060
combined air defense and and also author

31
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,770
of a number of open-source exploitation

32
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,329
frameworks like unicorn the social

33
00:01:20,329 --> 00:01:22,130
engineer toolkit and testers framework

34
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:24,979
artillery co-authored the book - with

35
00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:27,079
the penetration that certified been

36
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:29,149
testified front of Congress on numerous

37
00:01:29,149 --> 00:01:31,130
occasions and how about the TV show mr.

38
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:32,929
robot so that's a little quick synopsis

39
00:01:32,929 --> 00:01:36,020
of me and myself so there's not a lot

40
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:42,229
you haven't done that really yeah it's

41
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:44,240
really weird you know I remember growing

42
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,639
up as a kid and you know I used to play

43
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:48,169
a lot of what are called mods multi-user

44
00:01:48,169 --> 00:01:50,749
dimensions text-based games and you know

45
00:01:50,749 --> 00:01:53,359
I never thought that my dad would always

46
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:55,310
yell at me I'd be up until 2 3 4 o'clock

47
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,659
the morning playing these games and go

48
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:58,219
to school at like you know 6 7 o'clock

49
00:01:58,219 --> 00:01:59,840
in the morning and who would ever

50
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,219
thought that that type of habit would

51
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:02,509
have would have paid off in the future

52
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:04,579
but it's definitely done well for me and

53
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:05,959
just so humbled to be part of the

54
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,149
community yeah because the Marines are

55
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:09,949
well known for a nice eight to nine

56
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:11,510
hours of sleep at night

57
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:16,790
oh yeah that happened quite often Dave

58
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,830
tell us a little bit about how important

59
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,780
the community is to you because you were

60
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,060
the founder of derbycon which ran for

61
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,989
ten years yeah nine nine years and just

62
00:02:26,989 --> 00:02:29,750
I think you've it's safe to say that in

63
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,989
the Midwest of the u.s. maybe even the

64
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:35,510
whole of the US you've really been at

65
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,090
this at the forefront of sort of

66
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,160
Community Development and supporting and

67
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,010
encouraging the next generation that's

68
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,530
that I think you said it there the right

69
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,269
way it's it's inspiring the next

70
00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:49,129
generation right because we're only on

71
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:50,750
this earth for a small period of time

72
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,670
and you know I remember when I first got

73
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,739
into this industry it was a very small

74
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:57,170
industry I think DAF con EADS was my

75
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,720
first Afghan and you know I remember

76
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,420
hanging out with Phil Zimmerman and the

77
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,730
shmoo group and you know call two dead

78
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,650
cows and all these really iconic folks

79
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,930
that that really spun up what we know as

80
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,489
the information security industry today

81
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:12,890
and it was a community it was it was

82
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:16,040
people that had a passion to make a

83
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,109
difference to change things in a way

84
00:03:18,109 --> 00:03:19,489
that had that hadn't been done before

85
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:21,859
and you know people will say you know

86
00:03:21,859 --> 00:03:23,239
well hey there really is no community

87
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:24,230
it's just the informations good

88
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,760
profession and I really disagree with

89
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,340
that there's a there's a speaker called

90
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,620
David Logan who talks about tribal

91
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:34,299
leadership which is basically a way to

92
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:37,400
you know work with different tribes that

93
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,630
they kind of work together for one

94
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,269
similar goal or belief and you know when

95
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:42,769
I when I first started derbycon with a

96
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:44,900
number of my friends it was really to

97
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,299
recreate what I had experienced that at

98
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:49,370
DEFCON eight which was you know

99
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,500
community people working together there

100
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,530
was no egos or groups together it was

101
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,120
all kind of sharing and collaborating

102
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,000
and I think for this industry we have so

103
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,669
many an amazingly talented people and

104
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:03,139
and there's a whole influx of new people

105
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:05,389
you know you look at when I first came

106
00:04:05,389 --> 00:04:08,480
in it was 99.9% men and now you're

107
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,280
looking at it as maybe 30 to 40 percent

108
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,489
women and that's that's incredible right

109
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:14,870
and just having new people coming into

110
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,519
the industry and being open to everybody

111
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,738
and to really build upon that and say

112
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:20,599
listen you know we're gonna be here for

113
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:22,130
a short period of time can we do

114
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,169
something to help this new generation of

115
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:24,960
folks

116
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,210
coming in and to feel welcome that this

117
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,830
is a viable option for them in their

118
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,570
career so it's really skyrocket and

119
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,830
that's that's really what we built

120
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,260
derbycon off of was just community you

121
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,729
know we raised hundreds and hundreds of

122
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:38,010
thousands of dollars for charities you

123
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,240
know we gave back to the community I

124
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,850
mean it's funny you know when we started

125
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,410
there because it was never one to make a

126
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,150
profit we we put all the money that we

127
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,470
meet in the Derby County didn't see

128
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,880
either building next year to make it

129
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,889
better or to give it to you know people

130
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,060
that needed it there were in need of

131
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,520
help charities you know people that were

132
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,250
need that's really what we found at

133
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,600
Derby con off of and really what the

134
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,490
whole community was about well you

135
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,350
brought like a lot of those Midwestern

136
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,960
values because you know Cleveland

137
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,950
probably not known as this hot seat of

138
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,810
information security you know in in

139
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,810
general but as it turns out you know we

140
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,470
just spoke earlier today with Gabby who

141
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:19,169
is started in the industry about a year

142
00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:21,720
and a half ago and it's just going great

143
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,510
guns and it seems like the Midwest of

144
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:27,210
the u.s. is generating some incredible

145
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:30,210
capability that's that's right and I

146
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,100
think you know you hear a lot of you

147
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,630
know Derby concert it was like a lot of

148
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,220
the family values where I coming in and

149
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,389
feeling accepting them whenever you look

150
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:38,400
at what Gav's has been able to do um

151
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,320
look at what Katelyn and the badass

152
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,610
folks have been able to do as well I

153
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,650
mean incredible groups just spawning out

154
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,120
of something that you know they have

155
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,669
very noble missions trying to help

156
00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:49,950
people that are better meat and that's

157
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,840
the thing like you know people always

158
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,050
ask like what's your what drives you to

159
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,660
move forward and my my response back is

160
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,030
my whole goal is is to make the world a

161
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,530
better place when it comes to technology

162
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,720
and you know I hopefully can say that

163
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,789
when I die someday which will happen all

164
00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:08,130
of us died you know that that we did

165
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,510
something different to make the world a

166
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,220
better place and you know that

167
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,900
Midwestern value I think really has a

168
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,419
lot to do with that one thing that that

169
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:17,250
is in public knowledge yet but you know

170
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,380
this last derbycon was our very final

171
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,729
one we started something culture become

172
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:23,130
communities but we had some extra money

173
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,930
left over from derbycon

174
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,700
roughly around fifty thousand dollars

175
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,070
and all of those are going to various

176
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:32,250
charities love what we have

177
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,530
badasses getting donations the innocent

178
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:37,710
lives foundation what Amanda Berlin is

179
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:38,500
doing with the

180
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,060
the mental health health awareness

181
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,030
village that's getting donations

182
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,470
basically we're depleting all of our

183
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,150
funds from Derby County giving it out to

184
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:49,210
two charities to be able to help out for

185
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:50,950
those that kind of spawned those as well

186
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,480
help them on in various different ways

187
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,880
so you know whatever we can do is really

188
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,160
just about helping other people and to

189
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,960
make this community as great as it could

190
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,470
possibly be

191
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:02,590
on that note you've got a huge sort of

192
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,840
Arc of experience because you mentioned

193
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,940
some of the early formation days shmoo

194
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,610
and and called to the dead cow and add

195
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:12,730
those contributions so you have you know

196
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:16,360
sort of the whole lens of history where

197
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,630
do you see the communities going because

198
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:23,020
I think you know I see there there's

199
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,510
been some issues with toxicity there's

200
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:28,390
been some issues with I would say bad

201
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,970
actors in the space but do you feel this

202
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:33,240
is growing pains or do you feel

203
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,919
disconcerted that this is sort of a grim

204
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,419
future you know there's there's there's

205
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:42,220
no question that there has been some

206
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,640
toxicity some negativity there's

207
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,960
definitely been some unwillingness to

208
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,300
accept new folks coming into industry

209
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,140
gender race religion you know and again

210
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,180
you look at it and and you look at the

211
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,669
the demographics of kind of hobbits in

212
00:07:57,669 --> 00:08:00,850
the 2/3 it was you know 99% white males

213
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,680
was was kind of that it wasn't saying

214
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,640
there's anything wrong with that it's

215
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,740
just how it was you know 10 years ago

216
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,930
that's right in you know you have a lot

217
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,760
of different cultures now coming into

218
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,190
this industry and there's there's

219
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:15,010
definitely some conflict and I think you

220
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:16,720
have some old regime wait ways of

221
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,910
thinking that you know that are still

222
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,860
out there I think that's that's

223
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,960
drastically changing I think what you

224
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,470
see is you have fringe cases of a lot of

225
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:29,229
negative folks that aren't necessarily

226
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:30,820
accepting one another and I just want to

227
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,740
be clear that you know like everybody is

228
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,900
welcome to this industry no matter what

229
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,729
you look like or who you are or what

230
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:38,740
disabilities you have or how much

231
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,960
experience you have if your focus is on

232
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,490
social engineering you're not technical

233
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,229
you know this industry is in such a

234
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:45,910
diverse industry that it's welcome to

235
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:48,459
everybody and I think you know I think a

236
00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:50,500
lot of the things that you see out there

237
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,630
are really

238
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:55,870
the minority of people that still kind

239
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,370
of have that legacy thought I think the

240
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,250
industry as a whole the community as a

241
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,170
whole and when I talk about community

242
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,360
that there is no one community there's

243
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,160
there's thousands of thousands of

244
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,930
communities that make up the overall

245
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,130
community that's out there we have

246
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,110
different tribal groups that we all kind

247
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,540
of follow and kind of attest through and

248
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,160
try to make the world a better place and

249
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,770
so I think you you have you know fringe

250
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:19,690
cases of people that are you know

251
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,820
negative or maybe are going through some

252
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,440
very substantial issues in their own

253
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,090
lives or they're just not willing to

254
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,040
change or be accepting of other people

255
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,710
and I think that that is bubbled up to

256
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,240
the top and it creates a lot of friction

257
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,720
in our industry because you know you

258
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,150
have one person or maybe a group of

259
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:39,580
small people kind of know voicing we're

260
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,320
expecting with there are not good in

261
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,060
some way shape or form and you have a

262
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,670
community backing the majority up which

263
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,890
is great you know I think in most the

264
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:50,380
cases that we've seen where there are

265
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,390
issues that occur that the industry

266
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:55,120
really corrects itself and you know

267
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,580
really supports the people that are that

268
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,470
are being mistreated in a number of ways

269
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,610
and I'm saying it's it's a perfect

270
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:02,530
system but I think that the large

271
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,360
majority is really accepting of

272
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,130
everybody and I think the toxicity that

273
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:08,440
you see is a very small fraction of it

274
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,580
that happens on a lot of other

275
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,320
industries as well not just ourselves um

276
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,390
so I think that of course correct and I

277
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,160
think you know our outlook is very

278
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,560
positive you know you look at derbycon

279
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,870
and like I said as mentioned before you

280
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,460
know the diverse that happened from

281
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,830
derbycon one to derbycon nine was was

282
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,530
astounding it was no complete shift in

283
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:29,230
demographics of just white black you

284
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:32,170
know Hispanic you know genders you know

285
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,550
male females you know all these

286
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,840
different things that that happened and

287
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,430
it just changed very drastically over

288
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,080
time and it was it was a better

289
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,850
conference because of that and I think

290
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,800
that you know those those pains that you

291
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,080
see as the industry grows and matures is

292
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,510
bound to happen and it's have that you

293
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,370
know really emphasized the positivity

294
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,720
that's happening in the industry because

295
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,040
there's a lot of great that's going

296
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,500
going on

297
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:58,430
cool so I was gonna get Mike to jump in

298
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:01,720
on something here but it seems like he's

299
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,000
here I'm here too yeah so question I've

300
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,870
got for you Dave is 19 years ago when

301
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:12,320
Dave Kennedy gets into InfoSec fast

302
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,410
forward 19 years to 2019 when Dave

303
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,150
Kennedy's been in intersect for nearly

304
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:20,600
two decades what's different what's

305
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,490
changed in your view I get less hair

306
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:27,010
[Music]

307
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:33,560
kids that have kids sounded like a

308
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:38,540
really good question in my head what's

309
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:42,460
what's interesting about 19 years ago

310
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,720
when you when you look at when I when I

311
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,370
first joined InfoSec when I wouldn't

312
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:48,290
consider myself joining the information

313
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,820
security industry

314
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,370
I came in to an industry that really

315
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:55,220
wasn't mature yet and I found a group at

316
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:58,040
the time called remote exploit and that

317
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,170
was run by madiera honi mots that

318
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:03,500
started I wax wah fix auditor and then

319
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,390
ultimately can be became backtrack and

320
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:09,080
colleague yeah and this is probably 2003

321
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,810
when I first joined that group and I was

322
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,280
part of the backtrack development team I

323
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,290
was part of the exploit DB development

324
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:18,620
team and you know that group that I

325
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,390
joined you know I remember talking to

326
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,640
months in 2003 and I'm like hey I really

327
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,250
want to get into security not security

328
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,300
but I really want to understand like

329
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,860
programming and developing my own tools

330
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,390
like Metasploit and things like that I

331
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,420
think my Metasploit time was still Perl

332
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,830
and once as I came in you know here's

333
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,150
what I would recommend it must just

334
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:38,840
mentor me as as a young person in this

335
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,840
industry that really really you know

336
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,880
gave me that that inspirational

337
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,130
community feeling about how I needed to

338
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,830
progress my my career and I think that's

339
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,930
something that you know a lot of people

340
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:53,240
this disinterest is growing much much

341
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,340
more larger that if you're coming into

342
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,110
this industry to try to find a mentor

343
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,660
that you can learn off of that has some

344
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,400
experiences out there I have right now I

345
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,830
have about seven mentees that I

346
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,600
basically talk to you on a regular basis

347
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,260
I try to help

348
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,820
kind of brother career could that

349
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,280
welcome miss that we have when we start

350
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,780
and when I first started into this

351
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,160
industry having something like months

352
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,960
who became you know one of the most

353
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,390
pinnacle you know people in information

354
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:19,640
security I really credit some a lot of

355
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,950
my career so I think that 19 years ago I

356
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,510
had no idea that I was gonna be

357
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,130
successful in information security I had

358
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:26,890
no idea I was gonna run two businesses

359
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:30,680
and have you know 300 employees that

360
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,020
rely off of me which is its own

361
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,320
discussion in every sense inform but you

362
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,810
know it really changed my life to have

363
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:41,150
somebody that could listen about what my

364
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,470
problems were and what I was trying to

365
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,150
experience and how to kind of grow my

366
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,890
career and that really made a huge

367
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,810
difference in me and ultimately motsek

368
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:52,250
tax policy but yeah sorry shall carry on

369
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:57,550
me so you mentioned that already the

370
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:00,710
Derby current communities that looks

371
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:05,900
like a fairly recent thing it sounds

372
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,460
pretty interesting do you want to give a

373
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:10,910
bit more information about that yeah so

374
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,670
what what happened is you know we burn

375
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:16,580
down under beacon you know in it for us

376
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,110
you know running nine years of a

377
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:20,120
conference it when we started Derby con

378
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,650
it was like you know we were all in a

379
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,300
pizza shop and we're like hey we should

380
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,380
start this conference and think it'd be

381
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,270
fun and all of a sudden we're selling

382
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:27,950
tickets out in 12 seconds and we have

383
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,660
you know whoo tang we have Vanilla Ice

384
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,150
and we have offspring we have sublime

385
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:34,400
and it's these big parties and you know

386
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,350
nine months of planning we're dealing

387
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,910
with millions of dollars of money that

388
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:38,900
we're trying to like moved in different

389
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,570
locations and it's like well we we

390
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:43,700
decided that you know it's it was no

391
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:47,330
longer fun for us to go into and when it

392
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:50,150
was fun for us was when it was you know

393
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:53,270
1,500 people in less when and it wasn't

394
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:56,630
as much of a vent for us to plan and you

395
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,210
know what we decided to do was you know

396
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:01,100
and Enderby come because there's no good

397
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,770
way to say hey we're gonna cut you know

398
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:05,330
3,000 ticket and only make it 1,500

399
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,580
person conference you know it's good

400
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,290
sell it and half a millisecond then I'd

401
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:10,730
have the entire Internet torching me

402
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,800
with what you know with torches and turn

403
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,830
feather but you know it was one of those

404
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,090
decision that was really tough for us

405
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,190
but we decided to

406
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,510
answer the conference but we didn't want

407
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:21,670
to leave that that feeling of what

408
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:25,720
derbycon was and you know you know the

409
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,640
folks from security weekly did a did a

410
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,850
video and interviewed people at Derby

411
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:33,550
con of like wide Rubicon was special for

412
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:36,190
them and if you listened to 99% of the

413
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:38,830
people it's like they walked in and they

414
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,840
felt like family we felt like they were

415
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,970
accepting of one another you can come in

416
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,560
and share your experiences whether you

417
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,660
had six months of information security

418
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,550
experience or 30 years of information

419
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,780
security spirit and experience around

420
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,370
the same level with with other people

421
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:53,140
around you and you were sharing your

422
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,550
experiences and you're accepted and that

423
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:57,010
was really what derbycon was was about

424
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:00,460
and you know I think you know when we

425
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,800
decided to camp libéré began we we went

426
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,390
through some emotional challenges there

427
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,610
because it was our baby you know we did

428
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,290
a lot of emotional attachment to the

429
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:10,660
people you know that made there become

430
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,660
possible our security our staff you know

431
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,880
our sponsors the people that came to it

432
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,110
I mean there's just an amazing event

433
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,180
that you know changed my life forever

434
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,460
and so what we wanted to accomplish with

435
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,590
Derby County communities was you know

436
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:26,140
the people that were inspired by Derby

437
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,510
con to be able to facilitate and create

438
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,520
their own Derby Khans themselves whether

439
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,860
that was a monthly meetup where you're

440
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,840
accepting of one another you come in you

441
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,550
learn from one of those experiences and

442
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,830
it's just an open dialogue and forum or

443
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,390
it was creating your own Derby con

444
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:43,390
conference it was all part of that that

445
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,520
group and what we also did you know

446
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,050
there's also great events like b-sides

447
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,670
for example which is phenomenal right

448
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,230
besides happening all over the place it

449
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,660
was a phenomenal event I mean what Chris

450
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,000
and Jack and all those guys were able to

451
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,910
accomplish was incredible

452
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,290
we also created something called

453
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,240
establish which work conferences that

454
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,280
followed our three core principles could

455
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,500
join the Derby con network can become

456
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,970
part of it there become family as well

457
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,740
so beat we have besides you know

458
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,140
organizations and other organizations

459
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,880
that run conferences that are part of

460
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,650
the Derby con Network as well right now

461
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:17,560
we have 47 that I'm drawing before we

462
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,569
even announce that we are coming out

463
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:22,720
with it and so it's a network of people

464
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,270
that are really trying to carry on Derby

465
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:27,459
County's values which you know it's it's

466
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:29,350
positivity inclusiveness knowledge

467
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,760
sharing and charity

468
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,770
if it security pieces you know again we

469
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:34,720
I think it was cameraman the exact

470
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,950
system it was like four hundred seventy

471
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,800
thousand dollars that we had donated to

472
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,660
charities through our nine years running

473
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,240
which is an incredible feat and we

474
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,860
wanted to be able to replicate the same

475
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,790
thing that were able to create with

476
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,270
derbycon

477
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:50,500
to rest the world quick question for you

478
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,900
Dave from old red fox who's listening in

479
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,280
the the question is what advice would

480
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,690
you give to somebody that's looking for

481
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:03,940
a mentor so good good question I think I

482
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,820
think when you're looking for a mentor

483
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:09,670
you want to find somebody that has find

484
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:13,840
somebody that that is in the same area

485
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,760
that you had your same expertise like

486
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,470
for example you let's just say you're

487
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:19,630
into exploitation find somebody that's

488
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,220
in exploitation but also holds a lot of

489
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,110
your same values and traditions whether

490
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:25,120
that's you know positivity whether

491
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,440
that's you know their work for this

492
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,820
seems have a job you dimension want to

493
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,380
have people that would share the same

494
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,640
type of experiences that you'd want to

495
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,500
have in your career growth and honestly

496
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,900
just reach out to them and say hey you

497
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,480
know this is where I'm at in my career

498
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,679
you're somebody that I look up to you

499
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:40,660
that I eventually want to become is

500
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,010
there any way I can just bounce some

501
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:43,960
ideas off you from here to there and

502
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,850
what you don't want to do is be like hey

503
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,770
I need five minute call with you every

504
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:49,059
single day for the rest of your life

505
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:51,640
that's not going to work really

506
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,290
stalkerish people like hey why didn't

507
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:54,820
you call me today I'm like dude I called

508
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,200
you like yesterday this is getting

509
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,120
really weird that's why I gave doesn't

510
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:04,660
return my calls anyway well I try but

511
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,550
you know just just know things that you

512
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,780
can leverage them force you to

513
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,600
communicate in position in that way most

514
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,550
people will say yes and you know if they

515
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,870
say no they're not the right mentor for

516
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:16,660
you so when you look at a mentor look at

517
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,820
somebody that you wants you eventually

518
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,679
step in their same footsteps the career

519
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:22,750
pathing it's funny um there's a

520
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,429
something I can't to me his name is

521
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:27,250
Matthew graver came up to me when I was

522
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,309
like derbycon two or three and Matt

523
00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:31,780
graver knew and knew who he was and now

524
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,070
he's one of the leading research people

525
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:35,170
research folks from Microsoft they

526
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:36,550
worked on Microsoft networks of Spectre

527
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,040
ops and Matt graver came up to me and

528
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,990
he's like hey Dave you know it's got

529
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,790
some questions and i sat there with them

530
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:43,750
it served me con for

531
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,430
you know probably an hour just just

532
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:47,200
talking to them about you know my

533
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,670
experience is what I can do and all but

534
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,290
some now Matt greater than keynotes

535
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,300
derbycon and he's you know this this

536
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,920
reckoning force in the security industry

537
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:58,060
you know it takes you to go and talk to

538
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,610
somebody and ask them to help them out

539
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:02,320
to give some guidance and that that that

540
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,390
perspective can really help guide your

541
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:07,030
career as you kind of grow along and my

542
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,920
most most important piece about all that

543
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,290
is find somebody that is that is

544
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:14,350
absolutely positive if there are tweets

545
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:17,650
are negative if they're always negative

546
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,390
against themselves or others they're

547
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,460
usually not a good mentor find somebody

548
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,860
that's really positive in nature that

549
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,420
can really be a good mentor to you and

550
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,890
those will usually be with some of the

551
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:33,490
best people you catch okay Dave your

such a pleasure you know I'll close with

560
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,130
one thing which is you know this this

561
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:57,250
industry has a lot of different industry

562

563

564
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:04,120
you know all I can say to you is you

565
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,410
know for people coming into this

566
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,000
industry try to make a difference in

567
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,070
other people's lives uh one thing that's

568
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:11,890
not public news yet is when I when I

569
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:13,810
grew up I grew up in a very poor

570
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:16,180
neighborhood in fact it's it's one of

571
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:19,630
the top neighborhoods in the the lowest

572
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:22,480
income rates in Ohio um so I think the

573
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,470
average income is $22,000 where I came

574
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:29,560
from and it's a high school called

575
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,870
Bedford High School and when I moved

576
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,790
there my family moved from place to

577
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:36,430
place the place and I ended up joining

578
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:38,110
their technology board and I've been

579
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:40,000
guiding them on building technology

580
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,920
romance and not announced yet but it

581
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,800

substantial amount of money to Bedford

583
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,210

growing up as a kid in that type of

593
