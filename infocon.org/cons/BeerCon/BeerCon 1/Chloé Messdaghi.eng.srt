9
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:28,050
at point three security also co-founder

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,869
whoa SEC I believe you've heard from

11
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:32,729
Melissa Miller she's also on the team

12
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:35,300
and you're gonna be hearing Tania Jacob

13
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,700
she's one of the co-founders yeah also

14
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,440
the founder of women hackers as well

15
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,190
excellent so couldn't you give us a

16
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,170
little bit of a flavor of the work that

17
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,489
you're involved in the kind of stuff

18
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:51,750
that fills you sorry sure um so I guess

19
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,180
a lot of the talks I do have a lot to do

20
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,629
with cognitive science so like basically

21
00:00:56,629 --> 00:00:59,280
what parts of our brains are stimulated

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,590
so I tend to do a lot of that type of

23
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,250
work when it comes to gamification and

24
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,010
how to like develop your Red Team Blue

25
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,830
team of purple teams other than that

26
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,500
what I tend to do is also try to

27
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,240
increase the number of women in bug

28
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,970
bunny I used to work for a background

29
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,070
and I realized that like oh there's

30
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,530
probably less than 1% of women that

31
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,119
participate in bug bounties so I've been

32
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,700
trying to get more women in it also

33
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,310
pushing it out for safe harbor as well

34
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,360
and other than that that's pretty much

35
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,960
it I would say and just running women

36
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,860
hackers our online community all right

37
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,450
sounds really good it sounds absolutely

38
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,530
fantastic actually

39
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,369
could you share with us the experiences

40
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:49,140
you're having around women in InfoSec

41
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,780
and some of the challenges of really

42
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,159
some more importantly some of the

43
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,570
successes that you finding with this

44
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,960
certainly a really important thing yeah

45
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,810
um so a couple years ago there was a

46
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,370
moment where I almost left InfoSec

47
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,860
it was because I was dealing with

48
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,490
discrimination such like harassment of

49
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:13,030
course but also I was assaulted at one

50
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,460
of the conferences and so I was like why

51
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,590
should I be here if no one wants to

52
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,450
listen to me no one wants to see me and

53
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:20,500
they don't want to work on their issues

54
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,550
for including me and then I went to a

55
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,740
conference called daytime security which

56
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:30,130
I like 200 plus women in a room it was

57
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,540
the first time ever that I was around

58
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,640
women cuz believe it or not people this

59
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,430
is scary to know but I did know that if

60
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:39,430
respect was very active on Twitter they

61
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,630
didn't know that there was all these

62
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,400
online communities there are things I

63
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,460
just felt really isolated alone and so

64
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,220
basically I I went to this conference

65
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,250
and when I left I suddenly realized I

66
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,040
don't want to give up yet so I think

67
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,280
right when I got home I could not sleep

68
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,650
and said what I did is I came up with a

69
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,870
list of things what I want to change

70
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,420
within the next year or two so one of

71
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,870
those was actually writing a talk about

72
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:11,739
how to fix the diversity gap which use

73
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:14,080
cognitive science I'm explaining how we

74
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,060
like judge each other and the biases

75
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,220
that come around with it so then to give

76
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,220
people a little bit of understanding how

77
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,020
we can actually approach this by knowing

78
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,380
how our brain functions and then I

79
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,060
submit that talk for the first time

80
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,280
average like a different different cons

81
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,700
and whatnot and then I think by noon I

82
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,970
also had ideas of creating a virtual

83
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,880
community of women that hack at all

84
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,459
levels because the other thing is you

85
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:44,800
don't know where to start usually like I

86
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,450
don't know where to start as a like a

87
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,880
pen tester so how do I find that

88
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,680
community but also where do I find

89
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,450
somewhere where I don't feel isolated so

90
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,550
next time when when we go to conferences

91
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,200
you know sometimes is overwhelming

92
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,860
there's a lot of like men

93
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,830
in there and it's intimidating and so

94
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,630
basically knowing ahead of time who is

95
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,760
another person who's like you that's

96
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,380
also gonna be hid and that really helps

97
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,680
a lot it reduces like like the safety

98
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,520
concerns one has so yeah and then within

99
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,790
a year I met Tanya and tani I was like I

100
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,709
had this idea I want a great jeffers all

101
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:19,310
over the world

102
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:23,450
so what psyche was born and then women

103
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,550
hackers was created in May of this year

104
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,640
and we have almost I think eight hundred

105
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,090
participants cool in it um and we do

106
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,890
like car hacking and we do like all

107
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:37,160
different types of like resources and we

108
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,410
right now have partnered up with Alyssa

109
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:42,770
Herrera and we are starting a bug bounty

110
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:45,320
team of women from all levels and we

111
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,880
have about take 120 now so it's very

112
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,920
exciting stuff on the road sounds

113
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,870
fantastic

114
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:57,410
so the work that you're doing the

115
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:58,640
togetherness I guess that you've

116
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,240
developed with upa female peers within

117
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,820
the industry how are you finding up then

118
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,950
embedding and transcending itself into

119
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,800
the mainstream intersex society are you

120
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,450
a making resistance so you're getting a

121
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,850
lot of acceptance collaboration of

122
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,500
people welcoming in it I'm kind of

123
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,930
hoping the answer's yes but what is the

124
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:18,260
answer

125
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,530
oh my god actually what I was really

126
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,510
nervous about like starting learning

127
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,640
hackers I kind of delayed it because I

128
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,120
was worried about the trolling and like

129
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,130
basically what people would react to but

130
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,490
it's been really great like a lot of

131
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,320
guys actually have been showing like

132
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,930
support by say hey Chloe

133
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,490
I have this great idea I wanted to a

134
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,320
workshop for you guys can I do a

135
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,600
workshop I'm like yeah so if anyone

136
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,280
listening if you want to do a workshop

137
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,460
for women hackers anything we would love

138
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:53,150
it and that's that's it's been very

139
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,100
supportive I would say for sure but I do

140
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,600
get a couple of trolls that try to

141
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,010
register to join women hackers but other

142
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:03,169
than that it's not too bad at all what

143
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:04,100
sounds good

144
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,570
so my sorry that's one question so it's

145
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,249
awesome maybe thats coming

146
00:06:10,249 --> 00:06:12,729
that's the conferences and I've noticed

147
00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:15,979
there seems to be certain regions that

148
00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:18,859
have more issues than others it's not

149
00:06:18,859 --> 00:06:21,829
saying the region's doing do you think

150
00:06:21,829 --> 00:06:25,639
some regions have exactly like that more

151
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:29,379
of an issue more a culture around

152
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:34,479
females and InfoSec and protein and that

153
00:06:35,769 --> 00:06:39,709
so one of my good friends

154
00:06:39,709 --> 00:06:42,109
Jane Franklin she I was helping her out

155
00:06:42,109 --> 00:06:44,899
with her research she got an over 2000

156
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:46,849
women from around the world to basically

157
00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:49,489
fill out a survey about what it's like

158
00:06:49,489 --> 00:06:51,259
to attend conferences how they

159
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:53,839
experienced anything I don't know the

160
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:55,759
results of it but I remeber talking with

161
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,459
her about what are when has she seen so

162
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:01,309
far during the process I think she's

163
00:07:01,309 --> 00:07:03,709
wishing her findings in the next month

164
00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:06,259
or so yeah yeah it'll be really good

165
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,479
yeah and one of the things we were

166
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,939
talking about was most of the cases that

167
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:13,849
we hear about conferences it's it's a

168
00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:16,849
lot of times actually in the US but the

169
00:07:16,849 --> 00:07:19,159
other thing is they tend to be more on

170
00:07:19,159 --> 00:07:21,409
the tradeshow front so like RSA

171
00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:25,309
Conference blackhat those are the ones I

172
00:07:25,309 --> 00:07:29,569
would say are the biggest concerns and

173
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:31,159
the reason for that is that you're gonna

174
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,399
get a lot more people that are drinking

175
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,169
you're sure there's a lot more parties

176
00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:38,779
and most of the things that when people

177
00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:41,209
are facing these situations it's usually

178
00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:42,589
when people have been drinking

179
00:07:42,589 --> 00:07:45,709
I remember this year when I was at

180
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:49,009
blackhat and this is also a very common

181
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:51,110
situation recently we were talking about

182
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,959
a woman hackers was that we were being

183
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:56,269
people my guys would come up and asking

184
00:07:56,269 --> 00:07:57,799
us can you get me this drink or can you

185
00:07:57,799 --> 00:07:59,269
get me this because they thought that we

186
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:04,969
were waitresses yeah that's not cool if

187
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:07,789
they miss the giant geek nerd badge that

188
00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:13,969
you like making a badge or t-shirts

189
00:08:13,969 --> 00:08:16,959
saying I'm not a waitress

190
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:20,710
um but yeah like so much we were dressed

191
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,780
to the cheese we had like high heels and

192
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,970
like a long dress and bestowed over your

193
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:25,900
weight you're safe

194
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:30,850
so yeah that's that's pretty terrible

195
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,770
that explains why my drink

196
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:38,860
it might drinks but tasted like urine so

197
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:43,020
one other thing I've always seen around

198
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,460
women an enforcer carrying that I've

199
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,190
seen a lot of advocating to get more

200
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,200
women involved and I'm fully on board

201
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,750
with that but are we sometimes not

202
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,210
overlooking some of the root causes so

203
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:57,970
by this I mean if you go to a concert

204
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:02,890
course by and large the vast majority of

205
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:06,130
people in there or what males so perhaps

206
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:08,260
should we not be looking at a bit lower

207
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:12,970
down like at the school level yeah this

208
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:16,120
is a great question um I think that we

209
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,950
should start as early as possible I mean

210
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:20,620
the cool thing is that recently the Girl

211
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,910
Scouts they now have a second just to

212
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,550
carry badge which is really cute um and

213
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,140
that's that's a step forward but there's

214
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,330
a lot of organizations I'm switching the

215
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,400
bay area and I'm assuming also in London

216
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,490
and other places or they try to recruit

217
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,580
kids into like wanting to learn about

218
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:40,390
cyber security and I've done some

219
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,860
partnerships with some of the

220
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,980
organizations to try to get kids to know

221
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,510
about hacking is something that they

222
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,150
could do and that's the issue I feel

223
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,100
like there's not enough of that around

224
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,870
them I feel like if they knew like oh

225
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:56,530
wait packing could be a career wait what

226
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,630
this is fantastic I want to get into

227
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,820
this because it feels so amazing and

228
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,500
empowering when you can break something

229
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,950
or find something and so I think it

230
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,030
started at a young age is really

231
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:10,510
important but also it's a part for us a

232
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:13,240
look at this is right now so in the

233
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,470
situation like you were mentioning

234
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,750
earlier is that majority time it's white

235
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,320
males in a room and we need to change

236
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,450
that and by changing that we also need

237
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,930
to now share a little bit about

238
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:27,270
awareness and even when we do awareness

239
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,190
it needs to be applied there are some

240
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,170
good number of influencers out there

241
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,750
that are males and InfoSec and they say

242
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,180
the support of women but I've also heard

243
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,270
cases of them doing you know sexually

244
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:42,899
assaulting them to harassment to

245
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:46,140
discrimination and so I feel like we

246
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,940
need to really look at ourselves and see

247
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,580
what are we doing that is feeding this

248
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,490
problem and how can we fix it ourselves

249
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,040
I couldn't agree more

250
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,320
Shawn's point really really valid I

251
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,520
think because it's something that I've

252
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,779
been thinking about a lot in the last

253
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:03,930
year about the issue of the notion is

254
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,330
that were we seem to be tackling

255
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,970
attempting a tackle the symptom rather

256
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:11,790
than the cause I think that's kind of

257
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,200
where where Shawn was going with that

258
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,250
point and it is right it's right that we

259
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,830
get in really early doors in children's

260
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:22,260
development and in terms of you know

261
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,610
getting them to understand what they're

262
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:26,730
gonna try and enjoying their future and

263
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,320
have those conversations within the

264
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,140
development right but it's equally

265
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,500
important not to just say well well when

266
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,060
women are adults it's too late now and

267
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,510
their outreach you know and I think yeah

268
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,860
we can't look at it that way it's an

269
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,680
holistic thing that we've got yeah I

270
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,839
mean I still get comments that like

271
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,480
women should be in the kitchen they

272
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,790
shouldn't stop complaining that there

273
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:54,360
are cases of being attacked in a

274
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,790
conference is they just want attention

275
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,560
they're being dramatic

276
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,830
these are very common responses you

277
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:02,850
usually hear

278
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:06,180
I've actually had guys DM me balloon or

279
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,670
not saying you should be more focused on

280
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:12,959
getting married and having kids it just

281
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,140
seems so ridiculous in this day and age

282
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,220
so 19th century you're right just

283
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:22,190
unbelievable and yeah I'm so not

284
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:25,170
indicative of the community or the

285
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,910
profession that I want to be associated

286
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,880
with great but the good news is that's

287
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,070
very you don't get too many of those

288
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,959
most of the people I've met they've been

289
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:36,720
very supportive and seem they always ask

290
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,320
like how can

291
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,140
help how can I help because that is

292
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:44,430
fantastic to hear and I love that yeah

293
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,220
that's not absolutely brilliant so Chloe

294
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,240
you you're very involved in the causes

295
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,650
that you care about and I think the

296
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,510
cause is that we all care about to be

297
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,980
honest in anybody that doesn't care

298
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,900
about the causes you care about get off

299
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:01,310
this conference right now quite frankly

300
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:04,860
but what about reach I mean Shawn

301
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,630
alluded to it kind of globally what's it

302
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:09,120
like so the question I guess really is

303
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,310
what support do you feel you get that's

304
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:13,680
kind of not just the community so are

305
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,440
there any institutions or organizations

306
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,420
that you've got a fallback to or that

307
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,770
give you you know proactive support

308
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:22,410
either financially or PR or

309
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,540
encouragement do you have that or is it

310
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,630
already kind of like fighting a battle

311
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:30,390
inside your own network it's not really

312
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,370
fighting a battle of my own network the

313
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:35,190
thing is is like so before I joined

314
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,240
InfoSec I was in the humanitarian space

315
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,840
and it started in tech kind of field so

316
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,550
a lot of people are not aware of these

317
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,980
issues so I've been posting on LinkedIn

318
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,930
because believe it or not there's a lot

319
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,250
of people on LinkedIn and that's how you

320
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:54,000
get a message across all industries one

321
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,010
of the things I do see is that a lot of

322
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,450
times when it's like we're sharing

323
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,190
things on Twitter we should also be

324
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:02,730
sharing it elsewhere too and I think

325
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:04,320
more and more people need to be more

326
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,690
aware of and take InfoSec a lot more

327
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:10,320
seriously for example yesterday I was

328
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,690
getting boba also known as tapioca

329
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:15,960
drinks yes they're delicious anyway and

330
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,450
some people there are paying with her

331
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,070
you know but their iPhone and whatnot

332
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,400
but they don't even have a PIN number

333
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,410
when scanning and I turned to my friend

334
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,120
like wait are you serious this is still

335
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,050
happening and I get so common like this

336
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:33,930
is just this is too much so it's still

337
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:36,520
having those talks with people outside

338
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:40,930
I'd like to pay and what is a password

339
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:45,490
manager a VPN so I think the more we get

340
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:48,250
other industries to be more cognizant of

341
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,610
it the more and more funds we can get

342
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,390
especially get them to stand by our

343
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,670
sides when it comes to the causes that

344
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,780
we're trying to work forward

345
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,940
I'm specially when it comes to like safe

346
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,040
harbor that's gonna be like the thing

347
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,570
that I'm gonna be really focusing next

348
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,700
year on well tell us more about that car

349
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,230
if you don't mind it sounds ok

350
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,240
it sounds like privacy and gdpr and that

351
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,100
kind of stuff yeah absolutely I'm not

352
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,710
kind of interested it yeah so I always

353
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,440
have besides London this year giving a

354
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,800
talk about you know safe harbor and what

355
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,140
you expect during breaks it just kidding

356
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,910
I did not talk about breaks at all cuz

357
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:26,370
I'm not you're gonna touch that [ __ ]

358
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:28,510
sorry you're gonna have to leave now

359
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:37,030
Chloe just kidding but yeah about safe

360
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:39,100
harbor which is basically you know the

361
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,780
companies are being the doors to hackers

362
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:43,210
to submit vulnerabilities and whatnot

363
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,070
but there also has to be some sort of

364
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,200
protection also with that so if I'm

365
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,970
reporting something that's in the scope

366
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:53,110
I would be protected too so try to get

367
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:55,540
companies to be more aware of this and I

368
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,280
know the US government has been working

369
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,190
a lot on trying to push the harbour semi

370
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:03,580
forward but I think it's super important

371
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:07,210
because about 60% of us we don't submit

372
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,820
anything cuz we're scared more scared of

373
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,040
being prosecuted and this was a

374
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:12,820
statistic that

375
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,470
Amith else already found which he was

376
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:17,110
researching about safe harbor and so i

377
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,490
think it's really important for us to

378
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:21,520
start thinking about that perspective

379
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,210
for sure

380
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:28,339
absolutely um so one of the things I've

381
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:30,110
certainly come back to your example by

382
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:32,449
phone because it kind of reminded me of

383
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:35,300
the scenario which thing it was in the

384
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,579
White House ways topping zero zero zero

385
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:41,959
zero on his phone and do you think that

386
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,850
it has an impact somewhat because I mean

387
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,430
that's a role model for many people

388
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:55,660
mmm-hmm sorry I'm so cold killed me this

389
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:59,959
can be a wasn't it's just big Bugaboo

390
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:02,329
types can be a do it is voicemail yeah

391
00:17:02,329 --> 00:17:04,280
yeah I think it definitely brought

392
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,819
attention to like wait don't be stupid

393
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:11,480
don't do a pin zero zero zero but it

394
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,859
might change them to be like all right

395
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:16,069
I'll do one two three four now I feel

396
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:23,869
like he at least he had this one been

397
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:27,409
easy to crack but come on like yeah but

398
00:17:27,409 --> 00:17:29,659
but it's leadership by example right and

399
00:17:29,659 --> 00:17:31,909
how many people saw that and then now

400
00:17:31,909 --> 00:17:36,620
have their pin as as six zeros issue and

401
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:39,409
sometimes what I do is I tried it no

402
00:17:39,409 --> 00:17:42,559
sure as much as I can about fishing for

403
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,350
example and so like I will send emails

404
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,870
to like my close friends and family to

405
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:50,539
test them out to get them like always on

406
00:17:50,539 --> 00:17:54,409
top of things on their toes and so yeah

407
00:17:54,409 --> 00:17:56,059
it's a lot of fun test out your family

408
00:17:56,059 --> 00:17:58,220
and friends see the reaction you'll get

409
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,240
some mixed reviews

410
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,929
I carry to you sounds brilliant

411
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:05,030
alright so Chloe I got a couple of

412
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,309
minutes left and it's been it's been

413

just I mean you've alluded to it already

416
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:15,409
but just give us a little bit of a look

417
00:18:15,409 --> 00:18:16,880
into the future for you and the stuff

418
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,620
that you're doing and and way you'd like

419
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,299
to see change

420
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,190
maybe improvements and things like that

421
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:25,820
and the in the world a little bit that

422
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,700
inside please okay for those are

423
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,470
listening if you're not perm women

424
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:33,080
happier so you can see yourself as a

425
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,880
woman or non-binary

426
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,430
really come join us where

427
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,140
really good communities safe fun

428
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,960
supportive some people have found jobs

429
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,600
on it but there's really great workshops

430
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,510
so even if you um you definitely some

431
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,850
and you can always do a workshop for us

00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:52,910
the more knowledge the better and it

433
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:55,280
really helps everyone in the community

434
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,350
in the end because we're trying to build

435
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:00,320
trust among all people here and that's

436
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,300
the thing that we're missing in info ii

437
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,130
feel like is trusting to each other you

438
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:05,690
know our field is not to trust each

439
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:08,090
other but we should start trusting each

440
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:11,900
other a little bit yeah so it's always

441
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,860
open and if you are any woman out there

442
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,260

00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,470
you set up it doesn't take too much work

448
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,420
at all

449
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:35,540
other than that I'm going to be working

450
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,240
on later this year early next year on a

451
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,090
survey that's gonna be talking a little

452
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:43,010
bit about assault and sexual harassment

453
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:45,710
and also discrimination and that's gonna

454
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,960
be going around and I hope if you see

455
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,880
this link please share it it's for

456
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,850
everyone to participate and I'm hoping

457
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:54,590
that research will really help us see a

458
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,690
little bit more of an inside view of

459
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:58,520
what's really happening because a lot of

460
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,970
the cases are not reported so that's the

461
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:04,970
other one other than that I'm gonna be

462
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,130
at besides SF talking about mental

463
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:07,840
health

464
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,720
hopefully with mental health hackers and

465
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,210
I hope to see people there we're gonna

466
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:17,630
be diving into the brain and what are

467
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:20,210
the best strategies on various different

468
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:23,540
topics other of them that if you are

469
