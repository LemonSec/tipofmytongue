1
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:19,010
okay hurry McLaren hello good evening

2
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,349
Harry how are you really good thank you

3
00:00:21,349 --> 00:00:24,170
how are you nuts about bit tired as you

4
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:29,239
might expect give us a little bit more

5
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:30,860
intro Carrie if you don't mind tell us

6
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,720
who you are what you do how you feel you

7
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,440
do something sorry ahem attire and I

8
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,000
work as a product lead for the tension

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,469
response in Adama that's a scotland

10
00:00:41,469 --> 00:00:45,170
headquarters so food consultancy my kind

11
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,550
of history with values it's a restrike

12
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,579
university so moved to Scotland to

13
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:51,140
pursue a degree in cybersecurity initial

14
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,739
forensics wealth in stock initially

15
00:00:54,739 --> 00:00:56,300
exists senior analyst and instant

16
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,550
responder and then the last six years

17
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,649
I've been doing security engineering and

18
00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:03,679
consultancy mostly around soft tooling

19
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:07,550
processes that can think what makes me

20
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,290
tick that's a really interesting one I

21
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,720
guess problem solving fundamentally I

22
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,210
love solving problems or taking the part

23
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:15,440
of the problem or someone else to solve

24
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,360
cool awesome sock is something that I'm

25
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,950
particularly interested in you know this

26
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,170
and because it's something that I'm

27
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,850
trying to bring into the company I work

28
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:28,030
for her and get up and running

29
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:30,500
what kind of early days were dabbling

30
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,630
with tech at the moment so it we're not

31
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,010
really looking at it too much of an

32
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,110
analysis point of view and people point

33
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:37,760
of view we're seeing what we can see and

34
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,560
then we're gonna work out the processes

35
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,960
the people that we eat around but it'd

36
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,700
be really cool if you could just give us

37
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,550
a little bit of an insight into not

38
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:50,630
quite a blur song but sock life sure so

39
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:52,640
yeah but what is it what was a day an

40
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,150
average day in the salt look like I

41
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,890
guess else blue and still say what a day

42
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,720
now I would call them more traditional

43
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,750
sakis and then what I think a more

44
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,880
future looking they should be so yeah

45
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,620
your average security operations center

46
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:09,199
or security ops team because it doesn't

47
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,209
necessarily have to be a assault it

48
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:12,950
could just be a few security analysts

49
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,510
sitting in a room you fundamentally

50
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,180
you're there to triage security events

51
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,650
that occur within your environment to

52
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:20,689
try and work out whether or not they

53
00:02:20,689 --> 00:02:22,219
impact your business and then if you

54
00:02:22,219 --> 00:02:24,319
need to take action so that can be

55
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,840
everything from you know

56
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,060
literally monitoring individual log

57
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,030
files and alerting tools to monitoring

58
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,190
JIRA queue service now to use and then

59
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,480
when you get an alert through your

60
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,250
tooling you then do an investigation

61
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,440
your triage it and tree to try to work

62
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,209
out the impact or severity it's often

63
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:45,400
very manual in that kind of more the

64
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,170
legacy soft world there's often a lot of

65
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,180
churn as they would call it on ticket

66
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,180
churn and you know in some respects are

67
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,650
a little bit like a glorified help desk

68
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,830
in that kind of loan maturity sock it

69
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:57,970
could be quite soul-destroying

70
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:01,060
when I did it initially I got RSI just

71
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,680
from literally copy and pasting

72
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,950
screenshots into spreadsheets to prove

73
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:09,160
that the false positives weren't in fact

74
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,940
impactful when and yeah I mean it can be

75
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,860
a really great place to start and info

76
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,840
set because your cost of entry is

77
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,400
usually quite below you don't

78
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,900
necessarily have to have to breathe as

79
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,760
long as you're relatively technical and

80
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,739
capable of following processes it can be

81
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:26,440
a really simple way to get into the

82
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,560
industry you know but I think that what

83
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,329
it doesn't often do is give you a lot of

84
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:33,549
value for your work in that low matura

85
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:36,160
sock you often aren't necessarily

86
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,019
bringing much value to the organization

87
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:40,720
you're what's called your your true

88
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,810
positive rate is often in very low

89
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,470
percentage so you might for every

90
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,849
thousand tickets or events that you

91
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:51,370
investigate maybe only one or two of

92
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,450
them will actually turn out to the

93
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:55,030
incidents we have - belén often not even

94
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:59,079
be involved in the mediating and can be

95
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,880
a little bit soul destroying I'd hear

96
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,760
about that a lot I do anyway this idea

97
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,910
that you're kind of like a Burnout shell

98
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,130
inside an operation center staring at

99
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,859
kabbalah dashboards day in day out yeah

100
00:04:11,859 --> 00:04:14,489
I like to say you got a thousand events

101
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:16,720
one or two could actually turn out to be

102
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,168
something air quotes exciting and you

103
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:21,820
and you here as a consequence of our I

104
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,919
do then it leads to quite a lot of

105
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,889
burnout and refreshing and there and

106
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:29,020
also as a consequence of that you hear

107
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,880
people leaving the profession entirely

108
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,270
yeah exactly and so I think that that

109
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,099
moment you're soft all that and more

110
00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:38,020
modern sort it should really be a place

111
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:38,930
that

112
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,910
those lessons learned from what

113
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,250
essentially are decades of you know not

114
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,919
socks help desks things that run in

115
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,840
similar ways yeah possibly different

116
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,620
objectives and really try and use the

117
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,509
people process technology approach and

118
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:56,210
maturing across the board to step up to

119
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:59,570
lower that noise ratio to use computers

120
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,120
to do pretty good and that is follow

121
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,120
very programmatic instruction and I

122
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,380
think that's where life security

123
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,389
orchestration comes in and so you then

124
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:10,729
take all of that and all of those things

125
00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:13,580
that you do the exact same thing to day

126
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,580
in and day out and you go or a minute I

127
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,250
can just program the computer to take

128
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,470
those actions for me and to only bring

129
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:22,910
me into it when I need to make a

130
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,460
decision yeah and that's where you start

131
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,560
to bring that maturity like control back

132
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,490
into your sock

133
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,169
because then making they're taking

134
00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:31,820
action on things that are important and

135
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,410
allowing the computer to do the

136
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:35,090
orchestration component of gathering

137
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,889
contextual information and so on

138
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:39,710
yeah so it's clear that human

139
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,919
intelligence is incredibly important for

140
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,419
making those judgments at the end of the

141
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:47,090
day what part I mean you've kind of

142
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,169
answered the question I guess but in

143
00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:49,699
your experience what part was tool in

144
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:51,680
play and how important is it to get the

145
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,360
tooling right you know tuning out the

146
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,510
craft and minimizing the white noise

147
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,699
that kind of stuff so the tooling is

148
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:00,979
very important but is no more important

149
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:02,659
than your people in your process I think

150
00:06:02,659 --> 00:06:06,080
all three are equal partners in

151
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,900
foundations for a good team to work and

152
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,960
a soft cast to be fundamentally built in

153
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,310
technology there's no way to address

154
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,919
this problem manually through their Word

155
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,590
documents or Excel files it's just it

156
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,960
doesn't scale and it's old story they're

157
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,419
totally it's vastly important but if

158
00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:24,949
it's poorly implemented it's poorly

159
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:26,449
planned we don't understand problem if

160
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:28,400
I'm solve or you end up with there's a

161
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,169
black box solution in a corner it is

162
00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:32,150
nothing and actually try to make value

163
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:35,539
yeah yeah that makes perfect sense did

164
00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:37,610
you find in your kind of meanderings

165
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,639
around sock I'm cheating a little bit

166
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,780
because you and I had a coupla

167
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,280
conversations about the stuff behind the

168
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,479
scenes but did he find that you were

169
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,550
inundated with kind of snake oil vendors

170
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,689
that had got a solution of the problem

171
00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:54,179
you don't even have or you know we've

172
00:06:54,179 --> 00:06:56,189
got a thing that we'll just do all the

173
00:06:56,189 --> 00:06:58,289
work for you and all you guys are gonna

174
00:06:58,289 --> 00:06:59,879
do is just look at the little things

175
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:02,689
that get spat out yeah definitely and I

176
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,949
say this with the full knowledge that

177
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:06,149
fundamentally I do work for a

178
00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:08,549
consultancy so sure you know I'm not

179
00:07:08,549 --> 00:07:12,479
your average soccer experience because I

180
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,579
did work for that third party that's you

181
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:17,039
know does sell all the sell products and

182
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,319
it's a system integrator and so on but I

183
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:22,619
think that's also helped direct my

184
00:07:22,619 --> 00:07:25,499
approach to you know Technical Sales so

185
00:07:25,499 --> 00:07:27,659
when I get asked by a customer or why

186
00:07:27,659 --> 00:07:29,519
should we buy a solution it's not

187
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:31,649
because it's medical it's not because

188
00:07:31,649 --> 00:07:32,939
it's gonna solve your problems when you

189
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:35,129
turn it on it's understanding the calm

190
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:36,419
you're trying to solve and then making

191
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:39,029
sure that whatever solutions so the

192
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:41,069
solution is made up of people processes

193
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:43,469
and technology yeah and if you implement

194
00:07:43,469 --> 00:07:44,999
that solution correctly then the

195
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:46,829
technology actually it's worth the money

196
00:07:46,829 --> 00:07:49,319
paying for it but if you're just buying

197
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:51,449
a piece of software and thinking that

198
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:52,889
instantly your socks are going to be

199
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,360
really mature you're gonna you know

200
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,879
detect all the neck the latest APD's and

201
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,800
only need one sock analyst to run

202
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,739
everything it's just quite foolish and I

203
00:08:01,739 --> 00:08:04,050
think any bender that tries to you know

204
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,939
sell that narrative without really

205
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:07,709
talking about the difficulty of

206
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:10,199
establishing your true orchestration for

207
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,389
example or in inverted commas you know

208
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:16,259
next-gen seeing next-gen soccer all the

209
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:18,229
various tools that in a leverage

210
00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:20,489
components of AI brilliant that's

211
00:08:20,489 --> 00:08:22,259
awesome but it's only and not an

212
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:24,509
indicator to only another do and tool to

213
00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:26,909
try and help you with noise it's not

214
00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:30,719
gonna be this oh great with it we've

215
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,639
implemented some standard deviation

216
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:33,990
across all our searches well great

217
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,370
that's awesome it's a really powerful

218
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,860
thing to do but it's not gonna fix

219
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,250
everything yeah yeah I mean in my head

220
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,509
you can correct me if I'm wrong because

221
00:08:42,509 --> 00:08:44,339
you can you a few streets ahead of me in

222
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:47,309
this but kind of four basic pillars in

223
00:08:47,309 --> 00:08:50,449
my mind around security operations are

224
00:08:50,449 --> 00:08:53,629
or ability management threat management

225
00:08:53,629 --> 00:08:58,290
end point detection recovery etc and

226
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:02,189
probably Incident Response so I guess

227
00:09:02,189 --> 00:09:04,380
we're saying is it never pays to put all

228
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,510
your eggs in one basket

229
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:09,300
so the question I suppose is is it

230
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,150
sensible to put a blending of different

231
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,040
providers different technologies or are

232
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,870
there actually organizations out there

233
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,060
wait and just go and say right give me a

234
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,130
turnkey solution let them worry about it

235
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:23,490
and again I think it's probably both so

236
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,230
I think there are there are platforms

237
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,930
out there that can meet many of your

238
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,270
security requirements in a relatively

239
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,370
turnkey type scenario especially for

240
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,890
smaller businesses so some of Google's

241
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,050
makes ups and Amazon's platforms if

242
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,790
you've if you've gone or laying or built

243
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,100
yourself in the cloud then you can

244
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,780
leverage a lot of their those vendors

245
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:46,380
own technologies to deliver significant

246
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,030
returns within your detection or

247
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:51,000
response program your more traditional

248
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,850
or legacy IT environments you're always

249
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,380
going to have a blend because you're

250
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,910
going to have so many free technologies

251
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,710
need to interface with different

252
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,690
operating systems different environments

253
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,550
they're going to be locked in by the

254
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,710
regulator in some points so you may not

255
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,270
know you may not be able to use certain

256
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,000
technologies at certain places ochita

257
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,250
import/export laws when you start going

258
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,630
global it gets even more complicated

259
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,220
because of things that it take to

260
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,220
sovereignty hmm so I've consulted an

261
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,190
architecture firm a global bank they did

262
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:23,250
their in and I think 130 countries and

263
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:27,300
they have 68 site zones Wow the sit

264
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,980
around the world that you know own

265
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,350
different parts of that Bank or their

266
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,300
subsidies of those banks and so on and

267
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,070
so you know that's not going to convince

268
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,930
all of them all of those business owners

269
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:39,150
to sign off on one tool to rule them all

270
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,830
- not gonna happen or gonna have their

271
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,360
preferences their relationships in the

272
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,940
industry and it comes down to that

273
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,410
fundamental question of what's the

274
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,030
problem you're trying to solve and then

275
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:51,030
assuring your overall solution will help

276
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:55,110
you solve that problem yes so where do

277
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,930
you see the future force are consumed

278
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,820
and that kind of thing because if we

279
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,890
take a look back it was very much

280
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:04,290
focused on network security where as now

281
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:08,870
we're moving to things like beyond trust

282
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,730
software-defined parameters and that

283
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:14,100
kind of thing the whole thing has

284
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:19,560
changed so is does still play about

285
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,640
if so what kind of role I think it still

286
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,350
plays an absolutely critical role and

287
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:28,440
that is to be that that single point you

288
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,090
know that that you know wheel and spoke

289
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,250
type approach where yes it needs to

290
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,890
learn new skills and needs to really

291
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:36,720
understand their the piece of business

292
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,120
and the velocity so understanding

293
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,170
continuous integration continuous

294
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,570
delivery of software or changes to the

295
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,780
environment and configurations coach the

296
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,270
capability of pushing out software

297
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,550
changes for security tooling multiple

298
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,230
times a day and so on like really I

299
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,930
think and security operations is quite

300
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:58,140
behind a lot of those people in app set

301
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,860
where you know we don't push your code

302
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,500
to our C's generally you know once an

303
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,500
hour it's maybe once a month or every

304
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,720
six weeks there are companies that take

305
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,850
six months to upgrade their software on

306
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:15,120
their endpoints or pull down the latest

307
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,000
you know patch information might take a

308
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,810
24 hour SQL job none of that's favor the

309
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:23,910
purpose anymore the velocity of the

310
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,410
business and the velocity of the attack

311
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,090
is that are trying to circumvent these

312
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:29,520
controls it's too fast they're too big

313
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,260
it's too many of them so we have to

314
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,720
adapt or those socks will essentially

315
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,150
fail to do their job by helping keep

316
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:43,980
their customers say I guess so I'm gonna

317
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:51,120
be like the rest of us and really

318
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,680
freeing them up and coming back to that

319
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,220
kind of sore so secure job with

320
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,530
orchestration and response automation

321
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:01,050
etc those type of things are designed to

322
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,210
start enabling your analysts or security

323
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:05,580
operation specialists to put their time

324
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,200
and their skills into the important

325
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,710
parts there's like threat hunting and

326
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:12,000
continuous improvement of the systems

327
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,100
and processes that established rather

328
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,200
than dealing with that signature so I

329
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,250
think training

330
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,680
embedding more so more engineers and Sox

331
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,180
is really important who can actually

332
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,050
improve the stock itself rather than

333
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,220
improving other areas of the business

334
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,350
but focusing on self in its tools is

335
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,240
very good

336
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,430
so really interesting so let's assume

337
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,810
that it all begins with that set

338
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:37,360
management right so if we don't know

339
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,980
what you have then you can't protect it

340
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,560
certain can't monitor it you can't

341
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,120
report on vulnerabilities and things

342
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,490
that you find so assume we have a

343
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:50,200
baseline CMDB conflict management

344
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,670
database for those that don't know all

345
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,980
those which forms a fairly important

346
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,350
part of IT Service Management and that

347
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,820
allows you to do change management

348
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:01,320
incident management ticketing etc etc

349
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,030
where would you start after that so you

350
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,920
you've got a broad understanding of what

351
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,500
you asset basis and in in the case of my

352
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,210
organization it's pretty bloody huge

353
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:13,740
because we're an ISP right so we've got

354
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,180
internal core network infrastructure

355
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,370
that we care about and we've got ISP

356
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,720
infrastructure we care about them we've

357
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,250
got customer infrastructure that we care

358
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:25,270
about so what what comes next in your

359
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,800
head Harry is it vulnerability

360
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,200
management is it threat management

361
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,040
assuming that you can't do it all at the

362
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,700
same time and tell you definitely can't

363
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,350
do it all at the same time and it comes

364
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:37,540
down to understanding the business need

365
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,180
and there's I would say there's to my

366
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,360
way of two main approaches you either

367
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,470
essentially pick a framework off the

368
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,390
shelf and go we're going to try and get

369
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,550
to maturity level one out of five in all

370
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:51,190
these areas so the C is computer

371
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,560
controls for example yeah they're a

372
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,820
really good place to start if you're

373
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,930
just looking to pull something off a

374
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:58,660
shelf because you can essentially use

375
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,250
that framework to say foundational

376
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,680
controls of these and it gives you a

377
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,180
maturity model and you can apply it

378
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,560
quite simply and it gives you very

379
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,960
create guidance on types of things you

380
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,510
should do and even covers CMD V that's

381
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,880
one third it's the first cix controllers

382
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,740
know what you have the second one is and

383
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,690
all of your assets what's actually on

384
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:19,060
them what do they do yeah before you can

385
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,680
start protecting them and the other

386
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,900
approach and I think what I would say is

387
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:27,280
probably get you to a better and overall

388
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:32,020
and risk posture improvement faster is

389
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,720
threat modeling is actually considering

390
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,430
who your adversaries and what you're

391
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,620
trying to protect and then working out

392
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,610
what can go wrong it

393
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:43,010
we'll never implement every screen to

394
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,740
control possible he will never reach

395
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,480
full maturity across the board we know

396
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,670
the perfect doesn't exist especially on

397
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,650
security because of the landscape

398
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,530
changes faster than we can but if you at

399
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,510
least model upfront some of those big

400
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:59,240
risk areas in your own ISP for example

401
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,340
okay well what is your crown jewel what

402
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,750
is the one thing that your entire

403
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,220
business requires to run from a

404
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,620
technological perspective obviously if

405
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:09,020
you're branching outside security going

406
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,640
into information security then you've

407
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,990
got to look at the business with a

408
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,970
different lens and start to think about

409
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:16,010
things like and business continuity

410
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,960
we've got to speak about information

411
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,930
security and so on and so forth if

412
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:22,070
you're just talking about cyber then

413
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:24,110
you're gonna want to say things like

414
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:27,110
where where are key databases how what

415
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,700
are our key mechanisms for managing our

416
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,170
technology you know you're a technology

417
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:31,730
provider and I see it provides

418
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,480
technology school solutions to customers

419
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,860
how do you best protect those assets

420
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,840
against episodes that we're trying taken

421
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,810
from you yeah absolutely it goes back to

422
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,130
a point I've made a couple of times in

423
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:47,030
previous talks in one it's about risk

424
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,950
isn't it at the end of the day and the

425
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:51,260
risk the risk at the board level is

426
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,630
company closure or directors go to jail

427
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,580
being fine you know what kind of stuff

428
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:58,490
and then you kind of peel it back from

429
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,080
there to what may precipitate that

430
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,180
happening and obviously then you doubt

431
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,359
the things like data loss or really bad

432
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,310
phishing attack that causes around

433
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:10,520
somewhere or direct financial loss and

434
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,970
then you you kind of go from business

435
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:16,819
risk continuity to information security

436
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:19,550
risk down to cyber risk yeah because the

437
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,720
obviously the three things linked

438
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,540
together but yeah yes it's a real good

439
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,420
point yeah do you think those things

440
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,910
should be like documented and then you

441
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,680
start to expand test reports so often

442
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,270
with the pentose report to get a block

443
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:35,180
this is a critical but my reasoning

444
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,640
behind why that's critical and how they

445
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,660
impact the company so pentesting in

446
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,370
particular and I mean this in what I

447
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,080
would call acquaintance and it's narrow

448
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,870
description is primarily used as a point

449
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:50,390
in time basic technical threat

450
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:52,430
assessment against a particular us

451
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:55,520
of assets and it serves a purpose but it

452
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,740
shouldn't be used to drive the strategy

453
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,900
should be used to prove your compliance

454
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:04,070
to accept controls why I think is better

455
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:07,060
is that there's a wider security testing

456
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,860
function where you are constantly

457
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,900
looking at the different components of

458
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,090
your business and then testing them

459
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,880
against female framework to say well how

460
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,760
how weak is that control set how easy it

461
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,850
is to get around it and you know and

462
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:25,540
then we're procreate using obviously

463
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,950
broader pen testing I went red teaming

464
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,960
to actually then test the business not

465
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,910
just the ten components they're built on

466
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:35,660
yeah I agree with that completely pen

467
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:38,900
testing my head is an assurance piece so

468
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,100
you've done you've done what you said

469
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,190
you were gonna do right and you market

470
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,600
actually designed built and now you're

471
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,150
operating a thing whether it's a network

472
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:50,390
or infrastructure or anything are you

473
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:52,370
doing what you said you were gonna do

474
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:56,120
again exactly and I think is you're

475
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,410
going to look at different businesses in

476
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:59,120
different ways because you're more

477
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,710
legacy businesses that are built on

478
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:03,800
massive and sprawling technology stacks

479
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,260
and so on they're gonna have so many

480
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,300
that they're on what's the word I'm

481
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,720
looking for Lance gave you the

482
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,380
opportunity to attack it is very broad

483
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,970
whereas if you have something that you

484
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:19,730
have built in secures and unit testing

485
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:22,760
for example as part of your CI CD chain

486
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,700
you can you can test your compliance to

487
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,230
security policies because they're

488
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:30,530
defined as code yeah you can ensure that

489
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:32,720
no s3 bucket is ever allowed to be made

490
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,460
public because you have a unit test that

491
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,870
tests for that configuration being

492
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:38,930
present a great here and then not allow

493
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:41,690
it to get merged into master and pushing

494
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,820
into production it's not there or it

495
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,110
doesn't have a valid exception or

496
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:47,420
whatever you know that's a more modern

497
