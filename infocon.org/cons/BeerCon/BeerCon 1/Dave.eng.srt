the border right

5
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:13,080
certainly a Glasgow base but what can I

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:13,380
do

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:19,500
so I wasn't always the best yeah I was

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,359
always late and then the whites from

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,760
Glasgow so as far as I'm concerned blood

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,340
was a wonderful play yes that's a good

11
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,130

12
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:29,760

indeed excellent okay Dave if you

14
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,530
wouldn't mind just giving us a little

15
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:35,969
bit of an intro let us know who you are

16
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,090
and the kind of stuff that you get up to

17
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:45,090
right so I - I'm an old bastard bastard

18
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,700
Club oh yeah yeah well we were the old

19
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,730
masters of the course and and for the

20
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,039
majority of my career I was an IT guy I

21
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,350
did like chuckling support and a bit of

22
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,899
oil managed service stuff and then after

23
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,199
like five years straight or helping

24
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,449
educational establishments dig

25
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:04,709
themselves out from things like

26
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:07,560
ransomware and all that sort of stuff

27
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,680
I got can I hoped by next can a

28
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,600
colleague this Eddy I can't do security

29
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,350
for reals and yeah yeah right fine I'll

30
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,689
go and have a chat fell in love with a

31
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:21,170
company and that was it so for the last

32
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,659
15 months I've been working out of a

33
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:28,890
cybersecurity star in Denver and yeah

34
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,700
and it's been an eyebrow raiser because

35
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,070
you kind of go and go and I'm an IT guy

36
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,380
pretending to do security what do I

37
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,060
really know I've got a whole bunch of

38
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,710
graduates I don't have a whole bunch of

39
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,360
can I could I'd do it but work for me

40
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,799
and look at me and I'm so they're gonna

41
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,290
go what we're gonna what's gonna happen

42
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,000
here two seconds in the door they're

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,520
going you don't know if and your degrees

44
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,890
in computer and what and and it's how

45
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,290
many years ago is like yeah yeah yeah

46
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:02,159
added visual be taken ports plus but my

47
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,719
first job was an active database

48
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:06,899
programmer and you know it was like okay

49
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:08,818
I don't really know one that's fine I

50
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:10,649
can do that and yeah and it was like

51
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:12,760
that it was a weak thing and then

52
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,860
many said oh we are go to Imperial ba

53
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,019
pieces yeah no problem and a pirouette

54
00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:19,840
it's March come and talk to us in me

55
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,510
there's like hiya I'm a contractor and

56
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,620
I'm sitting here when you tell me to do

57
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,720
nothing for two months yeah and then

58
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,430
somebody handed me a CD drive did help

59
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,470
they help with the help desk in Gordon

60
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,299
Stover and I'm looking at this like

61
00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:32,950
Keisha hard wouldn't know he's even said

62
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,620
a PC before and then I ended up and that

63
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,120
was me customer service for them type

64
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,680
from my entire career it's feeding

65
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,480
helping the customer and whether like

66
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,400
some internal customer or an expert

67
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,690
customer it's it's the thing that pulls

68
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:49,299
my ball is that end user experience and

69
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:51,940
Noah to protect them that that end user

70
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,430
and the stuff that happens nobody's

71
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:57,489
about the can a resonation of a stop

72
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:00,549
blaming the end user a that really

73
00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:03,940
strikes a chords a I saw Jess talking on

74
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,069
a quick about two years ago and I was

75
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:08,950
like that's exactly what we should be

76
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:12,069
saying and is like this yet Jeannie in

77
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:14,109
the office click on the link and it's

78
00:03:14,109 --> 00:03:16,000
know everybody's having a really really

79
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,489
bad day know yeah but it's not houseful

80
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,980
so how does that link I mean how did

81
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,769
that gate to her and how did it have

82
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:25,540
such an impact that she clicks on it

83
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,849
that there's an awful lot of feelings in

84
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:30,040
there that led up so there's people will

85
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,599
be people and people would do stupid

86
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,730
stuff I have clicked on stupid links and

87
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,940
to show you and I'll know because people

88
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,810
are fireable

89
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,579
they're all pointing systems is to

90
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:41,829
protect people and help you users they

91
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:43,870
just want to do their jobs they don't

92
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,669
want to be worrying about it this way

93
00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:48,940
see look how do you know I've known

94
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,980
plenty of guys that are very tech savvy

95
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,579
and just about children or Apple details

96
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:56,560
insufficient safe bit and then suddenly

97
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,620
went the way that that's the women and

98
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,199
p.m. not be booked on all the way so

99
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:04,000
yeah I mean it is it's about protecting

100
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,519
being the end user people but the one

101
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:08,109
big thing that moves across the security

102
00:04:08,109 --> 00:04:09,970
you know she'll have been running a

103
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,099
soccer know run all managed services we

104
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:15,459
run but one of the things was that the

105
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:18,039
security gangs that comes trio will

106
00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:20,709
quite happily settle into all my god

107
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:23,190
this guy said it off like this you know

108
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,730
now that that that guy here is an IT guy

109
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:29,520
that's trying to screen 18 hours work in

110
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,210
the ers and nothing was working that day

111
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,550
the phone was ringing off the hook and

112
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,560
he finally got it what can anyway that's

113
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,850
fine I'll go back and I'll pay the

114
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,920
operator and never did and it's like

115
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,650
that you can offset the same way you

116
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,510
can't sit and show it Jeannie officer

117
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,850
clicking on something you can show on a

118
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,920
night at an 80 gang that was just trying

119
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,880
to do my job

120
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,920
you can try and educate but showing that

121
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,030
and for something that happened a few

122
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,310
months ago and he had absolute no clue

123
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:59,220
that you did it now you feel okay he

124
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,690
opens every minute I've literally come

125
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,180
across that he didn't any any rule

126
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,830
because he was trying to get a closed

127
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,080
system and an on premise or some talk to

128
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,550
each other nothing was working

129
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,220
and the ended up with a me any room to

130
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,530
make sure you can access it from some of

131
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,480
the firewalls Tim yeah they're not

132
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,910
fickle anything was you know been nobody

133
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,950
knowest you say Monroe okay Hannah

134
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,020
second the fact that you left then any

135
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,120
any suddenly left in any any rule in

136
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,820
your organization and nobody notices

137
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,370
until bad guy comes knockin and then for

138
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,980
injure establishments there's a whole

139
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,450
bunch of other systems that you should I

140
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,160
have in place and you should be talking

141
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,130
about right okay well how how how did a

142
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,600
bomb how would we not got a

143
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,310
vulnerability scan from the outside but

144
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,070
didn't point out the fact there we've

145
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,169
got these firewalls open weather and

146
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:47,850
there is certain legal Nick yet fix that

147
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,830
stuff don't show at the pool guy that

148
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,840
was just we've got something working and

149
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,090
then he got distracted I want to talk

150
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,100
about that because that's that's been a

151
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,180
central theme that IT is incentivized to

152
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,750
get stuff done and get stuff working and

153
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,250
security ends up sometimes being

154
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,669
perceived as the reason why that thing

155
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:10,050
can't happen

156
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,960
yeah do you find it because he came from

157
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,650
the IT to the security world that you

158
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,290
had to kind of change your your vision

159
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:24,410
or change out your your view no because

160
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,360
what I've tried to do is change change

161
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,270
the view so you shouldn't look like in

162
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,910
the end the businesses there to make

163
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,030
widgets

164
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,920
if you put and stuff in there and then

165
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,780
you say no you can't do that you're

166
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,490
stopping something do you need to help

167
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:42,160
them and some things it's an education

168
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,400
thing and are okay but if we do it in

169
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,410
this way then you get your end goal and

170
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,930
I get my end goal which is keeping

171
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,390
everybody sick and it's about that left

172
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,820
conversation if you end up being the

173
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,010
security guy that says no can't do that

174
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,890
no we can't do that insecure it does it

175
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,660
I mean I've seen it in our own internal

176
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,970
dev team and you know our own internal

177
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,590
monitoring where you actually have a

178
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,000
gangster man they're gone that's

179
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,610
insecure mr. fav you can't do it and

180
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,000
then the day of look she goes well and I

181
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,210
need to be able to do X function so if

182
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,370
andantino doesn't help anybody

183
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:21,760
it's come what solutions really write it

184
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,500
I mean if you can if you can't

185
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,570
participate in it and then certainly

186
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,610
right show me what you want to do I mean

187
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:30,100
so the biggest can it adage for I mean I

188
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,250
delegate and the saw and every gap every

189
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,020
IT guy I've ever trained throughout

190
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,370
years has been there

191
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:39,010
the gangs phoning you with an issue or

192
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,810
you're seeing an issue try and walk away

193
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,730
it was the person was trying to do in

194
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:45,160
the first place and helps them get Leo

195
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,290
even some has been completely different

196
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,120
question so why you asking me that

197
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,690
question

198
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:51,940
or why is it doing it with us all right

199
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,830
it's doing it about because the person

200
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:56,620
was trying to achieve X if you can see a

201
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,530
better way and a more secure way safer

202
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:02,710
way for getting to X then go help them

203
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,470
do that don't honestly know or don't

204
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,690
turn on the columns stupid cuz it's not

205
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:09,310
helping anybody and all you're doing is

206
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,290
you're silo in yourself off and then

207
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,530
people don't come to you with what I'm a

208
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,600
little bit worried about X and so you

209
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,460
meet yourself completely you know in

210
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,710
this ivory tower of security or of

211
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:23,350
fillings or or whatever it doesn't help

212
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,850
you god you'd roll up your sleeves and

213
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,500
say what you're trying to do Rick let's

214
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,450
let's go make that happen if you do that

215
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:31,060
you get far far better outcomes and your

216
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:38,159
job ultimately is much easier for sure

217
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,828
yeah I mean it's just a it's it's been a

218
00:08:40,828 --> 00:08:43,380
it's been a rampant and poor system John

219
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,750
to life like you know year and the link

220
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,690
between two days two weeks into the job

221
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,730
would like the it's handy an insert my

222
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,730
la right okay really means like should I

223
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:56,160
not be just watching all these young

224
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,680
kids with our forensic degree and stuff

225
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,300
or that doing that and you're sitting

226
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,500
there going in they look at you going

227
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,139
well what are going ask me a question I

228
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:06,240
don't know the answer right angle right

229
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,389
you're old people you don't know what

230
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:10,649
you don't you don't know what you don't

231
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:12,329
know sometimes and let's face it if you

232
00:09:12,329 --> 00:09:14,250
think in the webathon you're an idiot

233
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:18,209
yeah yeah I mean it's an interesting one

234
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:19,769
so you've been in the security industry

235
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:22,560
for what you say 15 months yeah a

236
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,699
particular 15 month

237
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:26,430
yeah 15 months so I think you probably a

238
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,529
signal example of a lot of people that

239
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:31,889
moved from discipline a into discipline

240
00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:36,060
being that being security so imposter

241
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,100
syndrome and all that kind of stuff and

242
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,310
hey everybody suffers from it oh yeah

243
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,050
gonna tell you otherwise they're talking

244
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:46,350
on their ass but just for the people

245
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,970
that may be listening there probably

246
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:49,139
aren't too many people listening that

247
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:51,060
aren't already in the industry but this

248
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,410
is gonna get recorded and it'll get

249
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,630
played out just talk us through a little

250
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:57,029
bit about the transition from not being

251
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,519
security into being in the industry and

252
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,019
how you felt you might be some of the

253
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:02,190
emotions that you felt through the

254
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:03,899
doubts and that and how you overcame

255
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:06,930
them just to just encourage others yeah

256
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:10,740
yeah so I I fell into

257
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,600
I mean had always been interested in

258
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,089
security and I'd always like done a

259
00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:17,040
little bit like with the earth little

260
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,660
course here whenever you could you know

261
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,170
steal it or read an X Y and say hey and

262
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:25,260
then you know getting involved in stuff

263
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,260
and that we might might eat I stopped

264
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,449
doing IT stuff and end up like you know

265
00:10:30,449 --> 00:10:32,699
just helping dead people over holes of

266
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:34,769
yeah we got run somewhere and then I

267
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:36,269
brought a guy and you said he knew what

268
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:39,029
he was doing and he didn't and I said oh

269
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:40,230
god right here we go

270
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,639
and the same were you here with IT

271
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:44,519
projects this year with Mookie see of a

272
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,170
Security Response as well as like that

273
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,730
there's a man and a white man that's

274
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,470
quite happily gonna roll up and see and

275
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,720
all my effects

276
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,180
doesn't who what he's doing sure and and

277
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,529
and you did certainly going you know

278
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,509
what the industries are not that

279
00:10:56,509 --> 00:10:57,350
different

280
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,120
the the security industry I mean

281
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,980
especially like this couldn't be seen in

282
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,009
like Glasgow and Edinburgh I couldn't of

283
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:07,100
asked for anything bear no I don't do

284
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,589
have not been to like official courses

285
00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:11,120
and lots of events and stuff like that

286
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,399
and b-sides and stuff about but nothing

287
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:16,250
in the bigger con so I'd not seen you

288
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,750
know some of the negativity and stuff of

289
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,779
that it's aiming that they lesson in

290
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:23,569
over the last kinetically X hours were

291
00:11:23,569 --> 00:11:28,329
we I put 1215 errors yeah it has been a

292
00:11:28,329 --> 00:11:31,459
has been an eye-opener all right okay

293
00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:33,680
the yeah can understand a lot of the

294
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,060
fears where people go on the corns for

295
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,160
the first time and then like discord

296
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,079
hired don't read ever will be doing us

297
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:40,819
all a little bit and people can I wasn't

298
00:11:40,819 --> 00:11:43,490
down the nose at year and worse but yeah

299
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:46,339
it's a for me it's they go out and get

300
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:48,470
involved I mean I'm a party or two okay

301
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:51,680
and I started and when you know what I

302
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,569
when I went in a bit when I did I key

303
00:11:53,569 --> 00:11:55,129
and I started in it you were a shirt and

304
00:11:55,129 --> 00:11:57,350
a tie a you were a core at you're a

305
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,089
contractor you didn't get sitting the

306
00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:00,800
night heat is that what a contrast to

307
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,809
doing one of the expenses he can have

308
00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:04,879
one of them with an iron bar across his

309
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:06,800
back and you know but he shouldn't be

310
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,569
sitting down anyway he should be like

311
00:12:08,569 --> 00:12:12,350
company he's over there doing that I'm

312
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:14,720
just going to order I and those of

313
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,730
punishment that the IT guy needs to

314
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:19,100
carry back oh yeah that me like that oh

315
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,199
I was in a company where they had

316
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:24,170
Harriman Mueller Iran cheers for all the

317
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:28,939
permanent staff and crappy link I 1589

318
00:12:28,939 --> 00:12:31,040
things that they bought from some crap

319
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,329
and you're certain they're going ma I

320
00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:33,949
made the mistake of sitting them one of

321
00:12:33,949 --> 00:12:35,689
them and I had one of those tears for

322
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:38,360
like four hours and there's a baseboard

323
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,410
over the night of my life but I hope it

324
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:44,600
only employees get to use the elevator

325
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,759
contractors take the stairs yeah yeah

326
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:51,379
you know all the other office in Albury

327
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:53,809
again swinging about I mean and now I

328
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:56,290
said that I go and and I can remember

329
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,939
the half the things that my guys come to

330
00:12:58,939 --> 00:13:00,200
me with the concern

331
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,760
they're worried and their personal ad

332
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,560
stuff with that I never would have

333
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,170
dreamed about doing that back in the day

334
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:08,149
and growing and now in Senegal I'm in an

335
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:10,480
industry that actually promotes like

336
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,769
looking after your mental health and

337
00:13:12,769 --> 00:13:14,360
supper and the read because of the

338
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,399
burnout earthquake analysts and all that

339
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,279
stuff and did a weird of it and it's

340
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,199
actually encouraging someone it's

341
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:23,029
amazingly working let's start up instead

342
00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:25,430
of you know a kind of stuffy office with

343
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,579
like 300 middle managers that never

344
00:13:28,579 --> 00:13:30,320
change and where are what happens and

345
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,209
all that so Milwaukee you said again

346
00:13:32,209 --> 00:13:35,060
this is fantastic but I get to look at

347
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,680
them again and you're just certainly go

348
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,199
in there and you just say missus it's

349
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,620
such a nice environment I do I go along

350
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:45,880
to all the cyber Scott and connect and

351
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,829
they are the people you meet everybody

352
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:50,990
is the hire what do you do how do you do

353
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:51,320
it

354
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,329
that's really interesting there's no

355
00:13:53,329 --> 00:13:54,649
there's none of it there's none of the

356
00:13:54,649 --> 00:13:57,110
snobbery or the I mean the number of

357
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:59,240
like you know IT can I can accomplish is

358
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,620
I've been where there is less where ever

359
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,269
we just want to sell you something or

360
00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:05,600
use you in some way and I will another

361
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,670
no are interested in your life this is

362
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:10,399
gonna you just anyone what what a

363
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,000
fantastic industry to actually be in

364
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,560
where everybody actually cares about

365
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,600
each other and I would all in a bubble

366
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,640
because we're all you know we all see

367
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,199
each other on Twitter and we caught the

368
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,970
same events and stuff and there's a lot

369
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,649
of people like there are probably

370
00:14:24,649 --> 00:14:27,649
articles but the ones I'm coming across

371
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:29,240
they're all fantastic and everybody's

372
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,100
dead friendly and everyone's only gone

373
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,690
there you don't need to know everything

374
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:36,529
you come help blowing yeah and I think I

375
00:14:36,529 --> 00:14:38,750
think you kind of answered your own

376
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,820
question in a little way around the

377
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,550
bubble bear I think it demonstrates to

378
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,410
me that we're a strong community and the

379
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:46,610
fact that we do see each other all the

380
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:50,209
time I mean just a point of reference we

381
00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:52,040
met you Sam's got on connecting

382
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,290
September that's going and we had a good

383
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:56,029
time up there and it was good it felt

384
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:57,829
great it was a really nice and warm

385
00:14:57,829 --> 00:15:00,230
event but if you go back to your point

386
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,880
about the attending conferences

387
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,220
generally if you want to be chased

388
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:08,060
around by a menace with a QR reader then

389
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,490
you go with the sekki you yeah you do

390
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,550
and then you watch your inbox

391
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,830
youngji below it would crap the

392
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,480
following week and people ringing you up

393
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,839
selling you up next gents there on the

394
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,370
other hand if you want to go meet people

395
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:23,339
just like you and I've got the same

396
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,750
worries and stresses and things that

397
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,519
they want to contribute but you go abbé

398
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,800
sieyès conference that's as simple as it

399
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,980
is or you've got skill places like that

400
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,930
and I'm yet to find in my experience of

401
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:37,420
a community conference and anybody who's

402
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,950
a dick I mean yeah of course that there

403
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:43,209
but nobody's room into my experience no

404
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:45,760
the b-sides or steal cons in the UK

405
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,220
because I feel at home in that

406
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:51,430
environment and when I attend those

407
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:52,930
conferences I get the nourishment I

408
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:55,329
think I need that lets me go on and do

409
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,640
my job better if I want a solution to a

410
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,560
problem then I'm gonna look for it what

411
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,730
I don't want is somebody giving me a

412
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:02,459
solution for a problem I am [ __ ] God

413
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:04,450
and that's what you tend to find when

414
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:06,250
you attend more of the commercial

415
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,130
conferences where you don't get that

416
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,570
when you go to these sites so that's my

417
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,910
rant I've preached I've done I want to

418
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,110
just add one thing to that

419
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,149
so yeah I'll give you an example when

420
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:18,010
you're at these community events and

421
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,440
there are I'm gonna say members of the

422
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,329
community that I hold in really high

423
00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:25,750
regard you know I don't want to be taken

424
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,690
aside by a Jenny Radcliffe and given it

425
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:32,560
tuned up right no nobody wants that you

426
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,540
know I don't want Brian to have to pull

427
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,490
out the American Express card again

428
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:39,930
because of my atrocious behavior so yeah

429
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:43,029
in a way though when a young member of

430
00:16:43,029 --> 00:16:46,810
our esteemed group decided to vomit

431
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:52,480
profusely all over the venue I think he

432
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,690
was pretty shamed into that behavior I

433
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:59,529
mean and and I hope you know I talked to

434
00:16:59,529 --> 00:17:01,540
him and I didn't say you know I didn't

435
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,890
really make reference to it but I just

436
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,169
said hey man like everyone's here to

437
00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:07,359
have a good time and it's just a bit

438
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,750
embarrassing you know what what happened

439
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,730
you know trying to you know try to

440
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:15,579
respect the the conference and the and

441
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:18,099
the folks that that worked so hard to

442
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:20,319
put it together yeah okay end up right I

443
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,849
didn't go up to Twitter I didn't take a

444
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:24,939
picture of his vomit and and put it up

445
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:25,740
online

446
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,109
you know just a quiet conversation and I

447
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:31,590
think maybe what's happening is is we're

448
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:34,230
not doing that as much as we should as

449
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:36,960
as leaders what do you think Dave

450
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,070
no no mentor people yes I mean let me

451
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:43,890

455
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:52,260
through sort of thing and there is

456
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,970

457
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:56,549
things you certainly gone there God how

458
00:17:56,549 --> 00:17:59,130
many times have I had to give her the

459
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:02,750
advice remember some all for given me

460
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,309
even back in the day when I started sort

461
00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:06,990
of thing I need is sitting there going

462
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:07,500
there

463
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,990
god I mean they're cliches for the

464
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:12,299
reason right but God I mean there's the

465
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,460
oh they're so true yeah me just sitting

466

469
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:22,320
that something I know the thing is I

470
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,309
also find that that nowadays the the

471
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:28,679
mental thing I think is is easier

472
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:31,350
because people are more open and honest

473
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,020
with each other

474
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:36,450
especially in our industry now and it is

475
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:40,140
just you know what it seems easier to

476
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,179
give people the advice I mean I've had a

477
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:43,890

480
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:49,470

that

502
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,940
terrified to get in an incident - in the

503
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,760
morning big stiff and all know I'm gonna

504
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,950
have to deal with like a customer at

505

like 2:00 in the morning what am I gonna

506
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,120
do what we're gonna see well if I get it

507
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,100
wrong you simply gonna one is 2:00 in

508
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,750
the morning you're waking up like you

509
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,690
know some some head of IT or some cease

510
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,549
or somewhere to give them the bad news

511
00:19:57,549 --> 00:19:59,370
that something's happened

512
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,870
they're just gonna want your expertise

513
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,880
and you are an expert you've been you've

514
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,530
done the education you've been sitting

515
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,840
and let the salt like over a year you

516
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,520
cannon or what you're talking about

517
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,860
you just have them a bit more faith and

518
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:15,220
in your own abilities but this is my way

519
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:18,160
of processes and this look T if you just

520
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,990
follow this you will not build to get it

521
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,640
wrong because this thing will will take

522
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,450
you through and Pecos honorably wrong

523
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:26,380

524
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,120
morning anyway so just give me forth

525
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,190

526
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:32,290
a grab it I'm not going to complain that

527
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:34,120
you've worn and say look I need a handle

528
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,880
this more label to complain that you sat

529
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,549
there over your [ __ ] and didn't say I

530
00:20:39,549 --> 00:20:41,890
need help and being able to give people

531
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:44,580
that conference to come and ask you as a

532
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,110
slightly older member of their can a

533
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:49,660
communication take their yeah you're

534
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,040
just certainly got out honestly about

535
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,630
all what do you mean you've not seen

536
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:55,090
cornea that be seen draws point why that

537
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:56,740
come on like you've just only gone the

538
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,809
number of references that I came into

539
00:20:58,809 --> 00:21:00,940
this job that just walked in my last

540
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,530
place because we were all the similar

541
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,860
ilk and you just sit in the gun there

542
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,390
right okay right we're going to come up

543
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:09,070
with new language because I can no

544
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:11,470
longer talk in the half movie quotes and

545
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,780
stuff about it expected to get well I

546
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,580
don't expect it similarly I don't expect

547
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,380
you to get every technical nuance and

548
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,730
every single thing I mean it goes a

549
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:20,290
certain angle or assess and I'm

550
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:21,429
certainly going there I dealt with our

551
00:21:21,429 --> 00:21:25,210
system 15 years ago it this application

552
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,950
that works like that it's been a while

553
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,240
since I've seen it you might want to go

554
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,640
google it for that restart and it said

555
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,260
look iboga canoeing like a gourd you

556
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,760
know it looks it will keep you help with

557
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,679
your godlike skills or the tail tails

558
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:40,299
all that hard giggles easier okay he

559
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,220
wants your own master pivot tables right

560
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,559
you're the mask of off penny to school

561
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:45,850
go figure of Peppa Pig don't you're

562
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:47,470
happy with pivot tables you can meet

563
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:50,260
that pen to enter music but yeah it is

564
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,170
just the

565
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:53,330
it's little magic it's just payment

566
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:54,950
experience and that's what you've got to

567
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:57,260
give more about anything else

568
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,600
hey because let's face our technical

569
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,390
skills will we walk there to MIT the

570
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:04,130
further we get away from something on

571
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:06,410
the front line dial-up modems are coming

572
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:09,440
back Dave there came back here bring

573
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,270
them bring them back talk about that

574
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,890
right away sir yeah

575
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:15,320
yeah I think discussing doesn't seem a

576
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,880
stretch and a hump you know they're

577
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,950
going what no no the same thing doesn't

578
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:22,490
know that's where you send the new dice

579
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:30,320
go and find me a dip switch modem

580
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,210
connection string that was my that was

581
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:37,220
my life for the longest way there was

582
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,440
the only way access the interwebs oh

583
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,520
come on

584
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,290
taste like when you when you had to sit

585
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:44,420
there and and you know certain time

586
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:48,080
share with your PIN so you could use the

587
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,630
phone link so you could see porn I mean

588
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:53,270
come on is like just sitting there going

589
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:55,010
there it's like anything well no no back

590
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:56,780
in the day Orin was like people like

591
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:59,240
great and stories each other and that

592
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,970
and that's why everyone needed a color

593
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:06,890
monitor absolutely

594
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:10,880
so all right now 15 months in you sound

595
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,440
like you enjoyed yourself and you've

596
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,030
settled in really well into the industry

597
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:16,910
and the community I do think the two

598
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:18,440
things indistinct about whether you'd

599
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,020
agree with that oh yeah I mean the

600
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,870
industries is the innocent europe's of

601
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:25,190
the world the rest of it the community

602
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:27,980
is us the people here taking time not to

603
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,950
have conversation to chat yeah in size

604
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,990
and stuff so they ask really the

605
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:35,120
question is what's the next 12 months

606
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,620
gonna look like for you e-learning I

607
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:43,970
mean because I got into a 90 the

608
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:45,140
certification thing they've gone

609
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,910
horribly horribly wrong for me cuz I

610
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,740
died to the manage so many contractors

611
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,660
with any CSE that didn't know what

612
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:53,960
logging on locally was there it lost all

613
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,720
meaning for me sort of things so I only

614
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,610
never did like handful of services stuff

615
00:23:58,610 --> 00:23:59,900
for that neither certainly gonna have it

616
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,610
you be the bou' stuff but there are

617
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:02,780
times you use technical and you know

618
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,250
warhead that all of the

619
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:08,330
you open a door or at least give you an

620
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:10,040
equivalency and a language that that

621
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,430
that means that people know that you you

622
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:16,250
know the basics is up on so yeah part

623
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,770
part part for me personally it's going

624
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:20,780
to be like search and jungle ignoring

625
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,760
the five in a sexual will be hilarious

626
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:28,190
but yeah and will not be much daddy

627
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:34,600
needs quiet thing he needs quiet time

628
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,510
but yeah and it for me is that like

629
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:41,570
getting back onto the official learning

630
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:43,910
learning and and and and going on that

631
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:46,190
wheel because for so long have just like

632
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,630
forged a boat in the in the bathroom

633
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:49,370
said I find something that interests and

634
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:50,900
I couldn't read about it and then you

635
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,640
can I get three boys are we clear get

636
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,500
enough and then you move off but you

637
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,940
know one of them complete some

638
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,970
educational kind of milestones as well

639
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,270
fantastic

640
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:01,910
that sounds good and will we see you in

641
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,980
the community in the conference circuit

642
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:08,480
next year definitely a because yeah a

643
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,580
the the b-sides and stuff of that yeah a

644
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:16,070
fantastic a elephant beggar I'm not sure

645
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:19,610
yeah cigar this weird think that even

646
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:21,020
like on Twitter and stuff like there's

647
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,820
an awful lot of people talking but not

648
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,290
not a lot of people seeing things that

649
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,990
painters and they gonna phone myself in

650
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:29,750
the last couple of years going be

651
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,280
centered and supplying you things on

652
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,810
rate or catering to what that I got

653
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:34,700
three no they won't gone find what but

654
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,520
feed and then start sharing it yeah yeah

655
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,300
excellent

656
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,400
so talking to sharing and going back to

657
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,980
really to thomas vicious point

658
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,600
how you feeling funky enough to maybe

659
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,080
stand up and deliver a talk oh yeah well

660
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,610
that's it as long as ago as long as

661
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:50,840
you've got a topic that i can feel like

662
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,240
invading it and and make some of these

663
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,850
life spoiler bear about it yeah then i

664
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:58,160
don't want to regurgitate all crap so i

665
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,700
think but there is a the problem is that

666
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,050
so many experts in this field be

667
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:04,910
something they've gone there right any

668
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:07,730
defined what what what my truth is and

669
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:09,790
and share that with people so that it

670
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:12,560
enriches the community sort of thing and

671
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,570
that's a that's a that's a big challenge

672
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:15,820
given how many

673
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,260
I mean look at the heavyweights you've

674
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:20,440
got on this today it just be understand

675
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,840
looking gone they're all mind gone it's

676
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,669
very fair to make fun of Mike's weight

677
00:26:24,669 --> 00:26:27,789
okay oh so the summer has come off in

678
00:26:27,789 --> 00:26:29,340
the last month or so

679
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:32,350
actually we're sick for like a month

680
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:36,039
yeah but yet but on your point Dave you

681
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:39,190
know talking about luminaries within the

682
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:40,720
industry but everybody starts somewhere

683
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,789
and everybody has got something to say

684
00:26:42,789 --> 00:26:45,010
again that was a point Thomas made yeah

685
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:47,139
there could be a piece of work that

686
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:49,059
you've done deep in your business that's

687
00:26:49,059 --> 00:26:51,580
really made a material change for the

688
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:54,250
good and what you're doing and other

689
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:55,510
people might not be thinking like that

690
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:57,220
and if we can stand up even on a rocky

691
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,559
talk 15 minutes and just share some of

692
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:01,720
your experience you might get one person

693
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,549
that walks out of that talk and go back

694
00:27:03,549 --> 00:27:05,679
to their company or even the personal

695
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,980
life and do something different and

696
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,659
nothing to change and that's and again

697
00:27:10,659 --> 00:27:12,610
that's job done as far as I'm concerned

698
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:14,679

699
