4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,840

welcome to beer con Katie Macias I mean

10
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,668
everybody should know who you are but if

11
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:35,280
they don't let run it down for us tell

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,660
us what we need to know about Katie

13
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,890
misters what you need to know about me

14
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:43,950
well I have I have been listening into

15
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,840
just little bits and pieces of the beer

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,600
con one show and I'm wondering what it

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,250
is that you wanted me to talk about here

18
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,699
except for introducing myself but okay

19
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:56,550
um Katie mistura's founder and CEO of

20
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,180
loot s security and what we do is we

21
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,829
mostly help governments and large

22
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:03,960
organizations work out the kinks in

23
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,489
their process for dealing filner

24
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,040
abilities and whether that's with the

25
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,170
Vaughn disclosure program or a bug

26
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,420
bounty program or repairing an

27
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,189
ill-advised bug bounty program that's

28
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:17,430
kind of what we do um I don't know the

29
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,250
internet might know me from things like

30
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,350
being obsessed with karaoke and bug

31
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,970
bounties and also some karaoke but um

32
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:29,880
but um of doing Microsoft's first bug

33
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,070
bounties and helping to launch the

34
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,570
Pentagon's first look at me so that's

35
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,400
that's pretty much to me in a nutshell

36
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,619
we're gonna get into talking about bug

37
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:40,009
bounties in a second but before that in

38
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:43,259
2015 when I met you at the Kaspersky's

39
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,009
SAS in st. Maarten you told me about

40
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:48,810
something called the wasser agreement

41
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,570
and some work that you did on it Oh

42
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,670
Austin our arranger yes as an

43
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,259
arrangement like flowers but with

44
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:58,500
weapons yeah I wanted because you know

45
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,670
what in 2015 we had some ransomware

46
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,960
people were talking kind of about

47
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,829
Stuxnet that happened but you know we

48
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:10,500
didn't really see the knot patty as the

49
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,450
water cries and stuff like that so much

50
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,550
later on so were you looking into a

51
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:18,060
crystal ball at that point or maybe walk

52
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,269
us through what that a range minh twas

53
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:25,050
and kind of like what the concerns were

54
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,300
that you that you raised and advocated

55
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,580
for okay so you want to talk about

56
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,849
export control of weapons meaning you

57
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:34,500
actually want everybody who was

58
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,540
listening to this podcast to abruptly

59
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,150
stop listening to this podcast so is all

60
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,849
okay no i'm Wassenaar arrangement so

61
00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:48,030
that was or that is a multinational

62
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,730
agreement between now forty two

63
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,200
countries they used to be 41 countries

64
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,170
since they added India to the to the

65
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,420
group of countries in Wassenaar and

66
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,239
basically it's an agreement between

67
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:01,950
these 42 countries of how they're gonna

68
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,709
handle exports of certain technologies

69
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:08,370
and certain items right and think of it

70
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,579
as advanced weapons technology so not

71
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:15,060
like nukes but like advanced radar tech

72
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,519
is a good example so that's what what's

73
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,989
in our arrangement is and at the

74
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:21,239
Wassenaar level these 42 countries will

75
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:23,250
agree on what their export controls

76
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,269
should look like what should be

77
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:25,829
controlled and what shouldn't and the

78
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:28,109
exact phrasing of how it looks in

79
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:30,750
Wassenaar ends up translating into how

80
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,370
each of those 41 countries then

81
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,350
implement their own export control so

82
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,090
you can see how immediately you've lost

83
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,799
all three of the people who are

84
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:41,910
listening at 8:29 a.m. on a Sunday in

85
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,609
the Pacific time zone so anyway though

86
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:47,519
the whole point here was everybody was

87
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,980
concerned about the addition of certain

88
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,959
language that basically covered

89
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:53,370
intrusion software and intrusion

90
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,260
software technology what that translates

91
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,010
to for us was that certain types of

92
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:02,730
exploits certain types of malware you

93
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,549
could not freely hand around samples of

94
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:07,470
it you couldn't hand it over across

95
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,319
borders to do bold disclosure

96
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:12,329
potentially without tripping an export

97
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:14,489
control violation and how uncool would

98
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:16,019
that be if you're just trying to

99
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:17,970
disclose a vulnerability or you're

100
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,829
trying to pass around samples want to

101
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:22,200
cry for quick analysis and you suddenly

102
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,050
have to stop and fill out some paperwork

103
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:25,690
for an ex

104
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,070
for control you know for an export

105
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,720
license right that would be a huge drag

106
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,270
and so what happened yeah huge issues so

107
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,490
what happened was a bunch of people not

108
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,740
just me but tons of people came out of

109
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,340
the woodwork wrote extensively about how

110
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,500
much harm this would do to cybersecurity

111
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,390
defense if you know you basically

112
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,460
hindered defenders who want to follow

113
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,070
the law with a whole bunch of new export

114
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,960
control rules and things like that

115
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,910
competitions like pawn to owned would be

116
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,920
much more difficult to conduct if not

117
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,050
impossible with these new export control

118
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,060
rules Metasploit might be illegal then

119
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,090
time well this point is already under a

120
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:03,610
bunch of other export control rules but

121
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,500
you definitely have a point yeah I mean

122
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,000
well it does because of encryption and

123
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,650
and a whole bunch of other stuff but

124
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:11,500
here's the thing ordinary things that

125
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,910
you would normally be able to do an

126
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,980
incident response such as you know the

127
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,050
actual unfolding of the response to want

128
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,820
to cry you would not actually be able to

129
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,910
do that without a whole hunk of

130
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,650
paperwork and export control licenses if

131
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,350
we had not gotten exemptions so what

132
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,630
happened was you know I and a bunch of

133
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,669
other people kept lobbying first the

134
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:32,470
United States and then also in other

135
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,510
countries and saying look this is bad

136
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,100
for defense you've got to change the

137
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:36,880
language you've got to put some

138
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,550
exemptions in here and then long story

139
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:43,060
short I started my own company in 2016

140
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,260
right after launching hack the Pentagon

141
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,020
and almost immediately after that when I

142
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,030
literally was you know I have no

143
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:51,730
customers yet and all that stuff the

144
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,440
State Department reached out to me and

145
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,300
said hey Katie how would you like to be

146
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,160
one of two technical experts who joins

147
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,900
the official US delegation to

148
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,640
renegotiate Wassenaar and there was like

149
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,669
boy would I love to pay my own way for

150
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:05,770
that right now yes of course like I

151
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:08,320
would be honored so I did and I did that

152
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,360
four or five more times over the course

153
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,340
of about 18 months or so that it took

154
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,919
but essentially we had you know we had

155
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:16,870
the job of convincing everybody in the

156
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,940
room that number one there was a problem

157
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:19,960
with the wasps in our language as

158
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,940
written and the problem was going to

159
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,470
impede defense so that was job number

160
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:26,290
one job number two was okay exactly what

161
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,480
about this language is problematic that

162
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,980
needs changing and then problem number

163
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,930
three is okay now that we've agreed that

164
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:34,180
it needs changing and the exact stuff

165
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,620
that needs changing and what we need to

166
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,300
put in there now we have to figure out

167
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,719
the exact words so

168
00:06:38,719 --> 00:06:40,789
objectives number one and two were

169
00:06:40,789 --> 00:06:42,889
achieved in meeting number one objective

170
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:44,749
number three took like four more

171
00:06:44,749 --> 00:06:46,669
meetings and you know five more trips to

172
00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:48,199
Vienna where these things are worked out

173
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:51,649
and so that that's the long and sordid

174
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:54,729
tale which I hope didn't scare away

175
00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:57,019
literally every one of the people who

176
00:06:57,019 --> 00:07:00,049
you know that is what happened that's

177
00:07:00,049 --> 00:07:02,149
what happened and it was my honor to

178
00:07:02,149 --> 00:07:04,639
participate and actually you know new

179
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,469
Wassenaar language was just introduced

180
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:08,689
that you know the Commerce Department

181
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:11,509
still asks me for help in looking at

182
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:13,689
proposed language and everything and so

183
00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:16,429
you can see you know some of some of the

184
00:07:16,429 --> 00:07:19,039
work that I continue to do states on

185
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,709
that right now okay I've got a got a

186
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:25,279
question for you oh yeah but anything

187
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:32,809
not expert that [ __ ] so alright

188
00:07:32,809 --> 00:07:35,360
my question is probably a broad question

189
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,909
but it's reflective of some of the stuff

190
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:39,439
that you you've said recently over the

191
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:42,139
past year really on social media and

192
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:44,989
it's really get your view on the state

193
00:07:44,989 --> 00:07:49,360
of the commercial bug bounty ecosystem

194
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,279
know I got to mute myself for a minute

195
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:55,369
here okay there were too many adult it's

196
00:07:55,369 --> 00:08:00,409
too much adult language anyway you're

197
00:08:00,409 --> 00:08:02,599
obviously very steeped in the entire

198
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:05,479
industry and the history of the industry

199
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:07,159
of disclosure of Oban is not that kind

200
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:08,809
of stuff I don't really have an opinion

201
00:08:08,809 --> 00:08:12,110
on it but I'm really interested in

202
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,719
hearing yours in terms of your take on

203
00:08:14,719 --> 00:08:17,269
how it's turned into an industry and all

204
00:08:17,269 --> 00:08:18,589
the rest of it and what the detrimental

205
00:08:18,589 --> 00:08:20,239
effects are that you see and all that

206
00:08:20,239 --> 00:08:21,769
kind of stuff so just Chesham your

207
00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:26,029
insight that they're really good okay so

208
00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:28,339
first I think I'd like to start with

209
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:30,709
where where I was hoping the bug bounty

210
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:33,769
industry would be by now and then if I

211
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:35,419
if I paint the picture of what I had

212
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:37,458
hoped for then I think you can probably

213
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,708
see how you know that the depth of

214
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,808
disappointments yeah you can you can

215
00:08:41,808 --> 00:08:44,779
basically measure it in you know

216
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:48,129
units of angst okay

217
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:51,110
so what-what I was hoping it was gonna

218
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:55,100
be was I mean look um you know the

219
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,110
offense world has had lots of ways to

220
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,209
make money off of security research

221
00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:02,300
right you know there's actual crime you

222
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,579
know direct crime as a result of hacking

223
00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:07,699
there's selling exploits to offense

224
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:10,160
users which a lot of people will say is

225
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,839
morally bankrupt and I disagree I

226
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,819
actually think there is a plenty of good

227
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:16,610
reasons to sell to offense and we can go

228
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,829
into that on another segment of another

229
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:21,319
time but okay anyway but the point here

230
00:09:21,319 --> 00:09:23,750
is that you know there there I I would

231
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,459
love you know pedophiles and and

232
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:27,649
criminals and terrorists and whatnot to

233
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:29,779
be taken down by an O'Day that some

234
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:31,850
law-enforcement agency bought rather

235
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,949
than law enforcement forcing backdoors

236
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:36,290
in crypto for everyone for example I

237
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:38,209
think there's yes yes so I think there's

238
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:40,819
a very legitimate market for offense

239
00:09:40,819 --> 00:09:42,529
abusive exploits but back to the point

240
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:45,589
the defensive side of making money from

241
00:09:45,589 --> 00:09:48,670
knowing how to hack [ __ ] has been

242
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,720
stagnated for quite some time there's

243
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,740
pretty much you work in-house on defense

244
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,720
insecurity or you are a pen tester and

245
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,769
those were kind of the two career

246
00:09:57,769 --> 00:09:59,660
options so here's what I was hoping for

247
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,540
I was hoping that if there were more

248
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,670
opportunities for people to make money

249
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,910
and you know and basically not have to

250
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:10,639
be the creme de la creme and find you

251
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:12,559
know an arm's broker for them to make

252
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:14,750
money but if there were a way for more

253
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,100
people to make money sort of a

254
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,769
democratization of hacking and the

255
00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:20,449
ability to make money around the world

256
00:10:20,449 --> 00:10:23,059
and not have to you know necessarily be

257
00:10:23,059 --> 00:10:24,980
a full-time pen tester I was hoping that

258
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,629
this would be you know this would be a

259
00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:28,819
way to do it and it would be a way for

260
00:10:28,819 --> 00:10:31,569
organizations to get more secure and

261
00:10:31,569 --> 00:10:34,129
relatively you know lower costs whatnot

262
00:10:34,129 --> 00:10:36,500
but here's what I found here is what I

263
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,399
found

264
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:39,550
you know Microsoft's bug bounties

265
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,660
Microsoft was actually quite good and is

266
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,069
still quite good at processing

267
00:10:43,069 --> 00:10:45,139
vulnerability reports they to this day

268
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:48,709
they still receive over 200,000 non-spam

269
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:50,360
email messages a year coming in to

270
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,639
secure at Microsoft so for them they

271
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:54,529
they could deal with a huge amount of

272
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,240
volume they also have money

273
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,190
wasn't money that was the issue in

274
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,630
creating their bug pennies it was

275
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,520
creating a workflow that could absorb a

276
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,180
different dynamic right and creating a

277
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,950
workflow that could not just absorb a

278
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,230
different dynamic but actually tune the

279
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,060
eyeballs that were already friendly

280
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,490
looking at Microsoft for bugs and that

281
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,860
took a few years to come up with sort of

282
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,450
the game theory and economic theory and

283
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,880
the handling of how those Microsoft bug

284
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,370
bounties could take place similarly with

285
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,740
the Pentagon I started my work with the

286
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,190
Pentagon

287
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:27,230
you know advising them from my Microsoft

288
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,149
days right and I was the only person

289
00:11:29,149 --> 00:11:31,100
that they were talking to you from my

290
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,760
previous startup before they decided to

291
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,020
go ahead and launch hack the Pentagon

292
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,790
for bug bounties but it took a few years

293
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:40,520
of prepping them so here's where my

294
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,610
great disappointment lies I see so many

295
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,860
bug bounties being introduced in

296
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,930
companies as this way to quote-unquote

297
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:51,020
jumpstart their security program a way

298
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,450
to quote-unquote find out where the

299
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,790
holes are before they've actually done

300
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,250
any internal due diligence so not only

301
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,260
is there a bunch of low-hanging fruit

302
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,880
that's quite frustrating you know for a

303
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,399
decent hacker you know with any kind of

304
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,529
still set to find they're gonna run into

305
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:08,540
these types of vulnerabilities that are

306
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,060
present on a lot of these sort of under

307
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,880
ripe bug bounty programs very very

308
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,220
quickly they're going to hit a duplicate

309
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,020
wall you know very quickly because it's

310
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,430
the probably the first person who

311
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,560
reports the bug gets gets for money you

312
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,630
know and then a lot of people you know

313
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,160
we have to try bug bounties and gotten

314
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,630
kind of frustrated out because of that

315
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,430
and it's because of the prevalence of

316
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:30,620
the low-hanging fruit stuff and when I

317
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,480
see over and over again and I kind of I

318
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,180
have to come in to organizations that

319
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,040
have asked me for help because either

320
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,140
they're bug bounty program is basically

321
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,399
turning out you know it's like they

322
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,170
wanted these but they get ants you know

323
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,910
it's like they wanted a certain kind of

324
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:47,120
bug goods that's how you get it cuz if

325
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,020
you want ants I mean that's they're

326
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,520
they're literally getting the wrong

327
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,380
kinds of bugs it is taking up resources

328
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,180
because they still have to respond to

329
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,440
them they still have to fix them they

330
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,880
still have to pay them out but they're

331
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,290
not getting the value that they wanted

332
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:03,020
why because the population that tends to

333
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,600
be on these bug bounty platforms is in

334
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,560
two very sharply you know to stay

335
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,450
Proops there's a massive sort of

336
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,550
spray-and-pray you know the folks that

337
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,290
do a lot of the scanning and the just

338
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,330
like spamming out to every program and

339
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,790
hoping to be the first one the lucky hit

340
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,890
and then there's the ones who have

341
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:24,640
really gotten good at making that type

342
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,980
of bug bounty lucrative for them and

343
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,450
it's Cena the bug many companies are

344
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,190
also pointing a lot more private

345
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:33,430
programs at these sort of you know

346
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,890
higher skillset finders that are in

347
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,440
their top 100 effectively so there's

348
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,480
nobody really in between there's no like

349
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,700
middle class of bug bounty hunter and

350
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,610
the reason is the lack of you know sort

351
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:48,010
of foresight in creating these programs

352
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,900
that are not very well supported on the

353
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,000
inside of their organization so anyway

354
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,220
if that kind of gives you a picture of

355
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,690
what I had hoped it would be

356
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:58,300
with all of this work so starting you

357
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,000
know way back from when I started when

358
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,860
Microsoft asked me like can you create

359
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,450
bug bounties that will work for us they

360
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,760
asked me that question in 2010 so here

361
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,640
we are at the end of the decade and I'm

362
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,070
staring down the barrel of what has this

363
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:15,100
become what is it done for security has

364
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,290
it actually improved things or has it

365
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,180
actually turned into yet another check

366
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,370
box where people can pretend we take

367
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:27,430
your security very seriously you know is

368
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:28,600
that a drinking game were you guys

369
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,140
better than that Bureau farmers are just

370
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,360
Wyatt one giant excuse of a drinking

371
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,650
game so I just iced wanted to us from a

372
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,750
company perspective I think there's

373
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,330
often a toss-up between the big bands

374
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:51,640
here in a contest Zoe Shan they're not

375
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,360
the same you know what all the marketing

376
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,860
that I've seen in the last couple of

377
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,900
years is really has really driven that

378
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,610
point home they're trying to say this is

379
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:02,620
more cost-effective than a pen test it's

380
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,120
just as effective or they're saying it's

381
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,640
more effective because many eyes many

382
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,459
eyes and I'm like which eyes though you

383
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:11,980
know and where was it the eyes of the

384
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,720
person who ran that free scanner or

385
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,240
nearly free scanner that you're in

386
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,100
could have run because those those are

387
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,930
some really expensive eyes then you know

388
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:21,060
why did you pay somebody else to tell

389
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,410
you that and to hit the button on that

390
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:25,320
scam Katie how much is you know finding

391
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,350
that the website that is protecting like

392
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,300
a customer data portal or something like

393
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:34,350
that it's running TLS 1.0 like you know

394
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,680
is is that gonna net somebody like am i

395
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,520
buying a house you know what it depends

396
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,810
and here's the thing I've seen in the

397
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,580
last year I've seen bounties getting

398
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:47,730
grossly inflated so I'm not gonna I'm

399
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:50,730
not gonna name names okay but I mean

400
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:52,410
there's only a few needs to be man so

401
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,080
just deduce but here you go there was

402
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,230
there was an incident at a you know I

403
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,760
share a lot of clients with poco new

404
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,980
platforms and they were doing a private

405
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,850
program and a bug came in and it was the

406
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:10,320
bug the bug was HTTP trace enabled that

407
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,350
was the bug okay so they were paying for

408
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:16,170
managed triage so the triage you know

409
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,760
from this platform this bug bounty

410
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,839
platform marks this thing as rating of

411
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,050
high now in the payout table for this

412
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,750
particular customer that high rating

413
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,380
would net the hacker I want you guys to

414
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,079
guess how much do you think telling a

415
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,209
company that HTP Trace enabled how much

416
00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:37,740
do you think that should be word you

417
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,020
know which is literally like my cat's

418
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:46,290
paw on the scanner I've got some history

419
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:50,130
here okay because we have a chancer come

420
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:55,339
up as with the missing header okay and

421
00:16:55,339 --> 00:16:58,010
this wasn't my decision but we paid

422
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:01,020
hundred pounds in Amazon vouchers out to

423
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,140
that individual okay so that's kind of

424
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:12,559
my baseline company so I'm gonna say 300

425
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,420
300 okay pounds dollars does it matter

426
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,369
you're about what is that it doesn't

427
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,599
matter yeah they're all worth calling

428
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:21,839
300 bitcoin okay now I wish for a

429
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,329
voice-altering like you something right

430
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:26,420
now because I need to sound like

431
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:31,930
like Darth Katy right now it was $4,000

432
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:35,390
$4,000 for a thousand four thousand

433
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,880
dollars yeah I'm logging that's so loud

434
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:42,290
right now but so here's the thing right

435
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:46,610
you know we're wild price prices just

436
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:49,850
wild and it's not look if if if it was

437
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:51,740
consistently where you know everybody's

438
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,630
paying out ridiculous amounts for

439
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:56,270
literally like mine on opposable thumb

440
00:17:56,270 --> 00:18:00,200
bearing cats version of a pen test right

441
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,180
you know and I'm just like and it was

442
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,160
literally you know it's a scare output

443
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,350
um it's not that they're paying that

444
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,970
much you know across the board bounty

445
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:09,260
wise cuz I'd be like you know what

446
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,420
children every child in America could

447
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,640
could pay for their college education if

448
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,680
they tested bug brownies because all

449
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,990
these rows of you a few left and hits

450
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:20,510
you know if I feel lucky a trace enables

451
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:23,480
but no it's just what it's just wildly

452
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,100
different you know in terms of bounty

453
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,680
amounts the discretion of you know the

454
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,440
companies the platforms everything and

455
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,400
here's the thing such a thing is I feel

456
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,520
like it's exploitative of both sides of

457
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,360
the equation

458
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,340
right it's exploiting the labor of the

459
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,590
hackers because plenty of hackers will

460
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,510
come up with actually interesting bugs

461
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:47,120
but you know either there were reporting

462
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,040
it to sort of a semi non-responsive

463
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:53,030
program or you know they've they not you

464
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,040
know they've been beaten to the punch by

465
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,420
somebody else you know and everything

466
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:59,420
and and they're doing all this free

467
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,820
labor you know essentially right so if

468
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,380
you think about it you know a lot of the

469
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,880
stuff that we had to look into we will

470
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,010
legal-wise you know when I was looking

471
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:09,440
at this for Microsoft was around labor

472
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,390
laws because Microsoft actually is very

473
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:15,350
sensitive to labor law type of

474
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,570
violations they had lost a class-action

475
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:20,630
lawsuit for labor law violations for

476
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:23,770
using contractors in place of regular

477
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:26,000
employees like kind of what uber and

478
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,350
lyft are going through right now in the

479
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,060
legal system with the gig economy stuff

480
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,740
where they you know they're they're

481
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,230
trying to say that the drivers are not

482
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:35,930
actually workers whereas uber and lyft

483
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:38,119
don't make any money without the driver

484
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:39,739
so it's kind of like but your whole

485
00:19:39,739 --> 00:19:41,659
business model is based on their like no

486
00:19:41,659 --> 00:19:43,819
no we're a marketplace no no you know

487
00:19:43,819 --> 00:19:45,409
and everything we're not you know we

488
00:19:45,409 --> 00:19:47,959
make this software platform so similarly

489
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:50,959
you know if you think about the fact

490
00:19:50,959 --> 00:19:53,479
that all of the risk is undertaken by

491
00:19:53,479 --> 00:19:55,969
the hacker by you know the driver in

492
00:19:55,969 --> 00:19:59,269
this equation right all of their legal

493
00:19:59,269 --> 00:20:02,059
risks are taken on by them if they step

494
00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:04,609
you know to the left of a poorly written

495
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:06,859
scope in one of these programs they

496
00:20:06,859 --> 00:20:08,689
could very well step into legal

497
00:20:08,689 --> 00:20:10,519
liability and who's going to defend them

498
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:12,319
if you're part of a pen test company

499
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:14,359
you're operating under a different set

500
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:16,279
of legalities and also you're operating

501
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:18,049
under the legal protection of your

502
00:20:18,049 --> 00:20:19,759
parent company you know you're not going

503
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:21,589
to get sued as an individual unless like

504
00:20:21,589 --> 00:20:22,879
you you've done something that would

505
00:20:22,879 --> 00:20:24,229
legitimately get you fired

506
00:20:24,229 --> 00:20:27,469
um you know and even that it's like you

507
00:20:27,469 --> 00:20:29,059
know I new pen testers who accidentally

508
00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:30,709
took down production still didn't get

509
00:20:30,709 --> 00:20:32,299
fired why because they were just doing

510
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:34,069
their job and they were indemnified for

511
00:20:34,069 --> 00:20:36,799
that but the hacker on the on one end of

512
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,629
these book many platforms is not and so

513
00:20:38,629 --> 00:20:40,729
there's there's that there's labor you

514
00:20:40,729 --> 00:20:44,089
know sort of getting doing a lot of work

515
00:20:44,089 --> 00:20:45,379
and not getting paid and then there's

516
00:20:45,379 --> 00:20:47,689
labor in terms of the fact that these

517
00:20:47,689 --> 00:20:49,309
bug many platforms could not actually

518
00:20:49,309 --> 00:20:52,219
survive without these workers and these

519
00:20:52,219 --> 00:20:54,589
workers are not classified as you know

520
00:20:54,589 --> 00:20:56,569
as as employees of the bug many

521
00:20:56,569 --> 00:20:58,909
platforms at all and then there's the

522
00:20:58,909 --> 00:21:00,469
other half which is you know companies

523
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:02,089
getting taken for a ride and paying out

524
00:21:02,089 --> 00:21:05,059
four thousand dollars for things that

525
00:21:05,059 --> 00:21:07,429
you know I keep invoking my cat as if

526
00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:08,989
like you know he's actually quite

527
00:21:08,989 --> 00:21:12,649
skilled you know yes Hugh Smith he's

528
00:21:12,649 --> 00:21:14,419

529
00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:17,599
years so satified he's a catamite

530

531
00:21:20,719 --> 00:21:22,609
gonna have to bring it to a close no

532
00:21:22,609 --> 00:21:27,009

542
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,110
was a pen tester for seven years of my

543
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:56,750
career so this is not an alien landscape

544
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,390
to me and anyway the point is I would

545
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:01,400
like for there to be more ways for for

our people to make money and stay out of

547
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,580
