good really nice to be listening into

9
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,380
the last hour or so fantastic it's a

10
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,559
pleasure having you on so we know each

11
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,630
other you and the bear farmers we've

12
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,520
kind of mingled it around the circuit in

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,390
the past year too I saw you at besides

14
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,469
Leeds I think last year and you did the

15
00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:50,670
fu foot talk which was fascinating it

16
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,020
was kind of heart melting in certain

17
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,210
places then it really opened my eyes

18
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,940
personally to the sort of human aspects

19
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,120
of what it is we're all about what we do

20
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,010
that was just a little anecdote from

21
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,510
that point on that follow you guys ever

22
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,689
since so again it's great to have you on

23
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:08,299
what would you like to talk about soon

24
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:10,830
we could we can talk about anything

25
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,979
anything you want really to be honest we

26
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:15,630
yeah we remember meeting obviously at

27
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,820
besides Leeds that was fantastic that

28
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,890
was the first besides Leeds yeah did an

29
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,950
amazing job putting together and that

30
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,250
was a slightly different talk for us

31
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,670
where we talked about he from us all

32
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,409
personal perspective and then we talked

33
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:37,470
about fear in terms of how it's used or

34
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,009
misused to try and sell security to

35
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:43,710
people so we took it we felt like we

36
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,939
were taking a bit of a risk doing that

37
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,790
talk and but we were really pleased with

38
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,229
the response that we got and we still

39
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:50,930
get we still get people actually

40
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,399
messaging our oil coming up at

41
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,399
conferences and saying that that talk

42
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,500
sort of meant something to them so that

43
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,930
was really cool

44
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,149
so we will see kind of both sides of

45
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:04,680
what you guys do so generously the

46
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,540
business operation that you you put in

47
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,280
place I remember it when it was a

48
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,610
redacted firm by the way our IP

49
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:15,550
yeah but I guess Jess you kind of focus

50
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,130
on the the human aspects of what we do

51
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:21,460
the psychology of a second the behaviors

52
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,160
and what kind of stuff and actually you

53
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,640
I guess you deal more with the technical

54
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,140
is that is that a fair split or do you

55
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,290
kind of both split what you do both yeah

56
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,630
I'd say it's my size the technical and

57
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,150
the physical side and Jess is definitely

58
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,209
the more human sight and straying into

59
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:42,970
the technical in some areas yeah yeah I

60
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,730
think it's been a good mix of our skills

61
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:48,310
over the last few years yeah it's what

62
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:52,330
made us really start so gender as we're

63
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,989
now called because we sort of thought we

64
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:57,550
bring those different sides together and

65
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,080
we're able to offer something a little

66
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,480
bit different with that and yeah we felt

67
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,550
really really lucky you're really happy

68
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,430
with how the businesses taken off so

69
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,340
having watched you develop I guess your

70
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,640
business over the past year you seemed

71
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,410
to do things separately and then you see

72
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,610
we do things together know you do a lot

73
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,140
community work down on the southwest

74
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,180
around getting in for second technology

75
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,950
engendered in schooling and all that

76
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,780
kind of stuff which I think's wonderful

77
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,390
but could you each give us an example of

78
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,470
some of the stuff that you've been doing

79
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:30,340
over the past year yeah sure so we do a

80
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,920
lot of outreach and and that's something

81
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,660
we do kind of on the side of the

82
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,180
business to be honest but something

83
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,650
we're both really passionate about in

84
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:41,049
terms of the work we do with clients

85
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:43,540
it's it tends to be very mixed most of

86
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,350
our clients are very large

87
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,480
multinationals across all sorts of

88
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,209
different sectors I'd say the bulk are

89
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:55,269
in financial services but we have large

90
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:59,830
retailers health care education some

91
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:03,010
marketing companies law firms and so

92
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:06,250
it's quite a mix in terms of what I to

93
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,829
you it's as you said earlier all focused

94
00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:11,320
on awareness behavior and culture so

95
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,630
I've been in the industry for nine but

96
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,820
nine years and I've always focused on

97
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,519
the human side so I work with clients on

98
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,978
their awareness raising everything from

99
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:24,220
helping their strategies through to kind

100
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:24,630
of do

101
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:28,590
during sessions for them and then I also

102
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:31,970
do cultural assessments so help clients

103
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,230
understand what their cybersecurity

104
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:37,230
culture is like you know in terms of

105
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,390
what they want from people and what's

106
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,640
actually happening where people are

107
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,320
finding workarounds when it comes to

108
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,030
security and why they might be doing

109
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,700
that and then we have a product called

110
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,420
seed app which also is very focused on

111
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,130
awareness raising and doing us

112
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,110
measurement of culture at the

113
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:58,440
organizational team and individual level

114
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,250
cool are you seeing behaviour change it

115
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,920
I work in an enterprise where it's a

116
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,170
constant battle to keep awareness high

117
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,540
and it's implement new controls and get

118
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,310
technology bought in and find funding

119
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,050
for stuff are you seeing

120
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,180
I guess when organizations look at

121
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,920
what's happening in the news and I'm

122
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,420
thinking date breaches and all the kind

123
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,920
of really high profile stuff that

124
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,780
happens you would like to think that

125
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,730
that's a wake-up call for organizations

126
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,530
to start getting the house in order ease

127
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,000
don't see that kind of thing happening

128
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,800
or are you finding it's still a bit of a

129
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,560
struggle well I think it's awareness

130
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,240
behavior culture you know it's like

131
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,100
security in general it's not something

132
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,710
that's ever just fixed like you're never

133
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:40,620
just there and it's done something

134
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,450
that's that's always a process and

135
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:45,240
always needs to be worked on and but

136
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,850
definitely you know compared to when I

137
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,530
started down nine years ago and over

138
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,400
that time there's been a there's being

139
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,490
like a huge shift I think in terms of

140
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,730
more and more organizations recognizing

141
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,850
that the human side is important

142
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:05,040
recognizing that they need to do

143
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,900
something around awareness that it can't

144
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,020
just be like tick box approach you know

145
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,850
once a year training for people or you

146
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,490
kind of borer and click through

147
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:16,950
computer-based training so it's I think

148
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,360
it's definitely changed I think the

149
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,070
amount that it hits the headlines does

150
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,770
make a difference but sometimes it's

151
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,040
about engaging the particular

152
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,270
organization or particular teams within

153
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,460
an organization as to how it's relevant

154
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,740
to them is sometimes people can find a

155
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,150
thing

156
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:35,220
well it's insecurities stuff that other

157
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,930
companies need to worry about what other

158
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,850
people need to worry about people can

159
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,890
have a bit of a tendency to think it's

160
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:43,860
never gonna happen to them sure I want

161
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,200
to jump in with something so two things

162
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,830
the first is just a huge compliment to

163
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:52,110
Jessica who I meet a lot on the more

164
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,120
corporate II circle where she's

165
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,490
frequently sought out facilitator and

166
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:00,180
guest speaker and it's always lovely to

167
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,860
run into you and you always have a kind

168
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,460
word and are just super upbeat so I want

169
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,590
to say that the then I want to bounce

170
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:10,770
over to freaky because I feel a little

171
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:13,250
bit of a kindred spirit with him because

172
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,320
both of us I think have done some some

173
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,830
time in some organizations the mileage

174
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,920
that we've put on our bodies and stuff

175
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,950
with that freaky is it getting harder or

176
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:30,300
is it getting easier yeah I was like the

177
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,180
the the saying that at some point you're

178
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,560
gonna have to start to do some running

179
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,290
and that's never more true in our

180
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,360
organizations and the stuff that we've

181
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,130
done is tough on the knees and as I'm

182
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:49,830
getting I'm running less do you find

183
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:53,250
though that it's that the physical side

184
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,900
of the security thing like when you're

185
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,280
when you're move it when you're trying

186
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,230
to get into a place or whatever do you

187
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,510
find like it is getting a bit tougher

188
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:03,690
like people are hardening their defenses

189
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,870
or you still find it's like a hot knife

190
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,850
rolling through butter so I've been

191
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,740
doing this for like you know coming up

192
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,070
to thirty years now yeah breaking into

193
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,840
all sorts of started when he was 10

194
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,060
years old people know I'm a lot older

195
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,210
than I look

196
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:23,220
yeah the paper gives it an air of

197
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,620
youngness and we have absolutely no idea

198
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,150
referencing whether you have any hair

199
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:32,280
yeah I'll share a photo in next couple

200
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,900
of weeks will show you what's under my

201
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,079
hat

202
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:41,159
but yeah have I seen an increase in

203
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:45,120
security as it got harder no in a word

204
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,320
no it hasn't

205
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,240
I've still got a hundred percent success

206
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,370
rate getting into everywhere it's never

207
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,260
going to change because of that's how

208
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,730
social engineering and physical

209
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:56,130
assessments always work is there's

210
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,500
always a way in there's always something

211
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,200
and if you've if you're trying to fix

212
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,620
everything you you're gonna fail you can

213
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,080
only sort of mitigate when it goes wrong

214
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,200
so how's it gonna know have you ever

215
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,450
have you ever been bounced from a client

216
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,940
where you were like I didn't think you

217
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,440
know they would have had the process of

218
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,200
procedures in place but then you go into

219
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,760
like a really high-security place

220
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,080
they're just like completely

221
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,870
laissez-faire

222
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:27,330
yeah it's kind of odd like you you think

223
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,430
that the more secure places are gonna be

224
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:33,050
better at it but they're generally not

225
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:36,690
it's it's a very odd world that they

226
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,860
live in I think sometimes

227
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:46,040
cool one thing I wanted to ask is um I

228
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,280
only see you two jetting off all over

229
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,960
the world placing some amazing photos

230
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,780
which I'm sure there's that lovely

231
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,020
aspect to it but is it they're all just

232
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,490
some sort of dance ads how do you guys

233
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:04,640
capable being away from home so much is

234
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,110
there any advice you can give anyone

235
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:09,290
yeah it's I mean it's it's great like we

236
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:12,050
are constantly aware of how privileged

237
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:15,650
we are and you know the fact that a hard

238
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,990
day for us is not like you know to me

239
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,820
we're still in an amazing industry doing

240
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:23,600
amazing work and and so we constantly

241
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,250
feel privileged by it we get to go to

242
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,440
great places see beautiful parts of the

243
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,340
world and we love what we do so you know

244
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,020
what that's like it's amazing when you

245
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,160
can do something you're passionate about

246
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,560
but of course it is tiring

247
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,750
laughing so we've both flown the

248
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,850
equivalent of over twice around the

249
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:46,460
world yeah just wow so it is tiring and

250
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,020
sometimes we get to do it together which

251
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,150
is amazing often when we're doing it

252
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,880
apart and so sometimes one of us is in

253
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,590
one part of the world and we come back

254
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,910
and the other ones just flown off

255
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:59,600
somewhere so we constantly have like a

256
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,290
suitcase packed and I think the most

257
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,750
important thing is actually being

258
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:09,500
organized knowing where you're going and

259
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,060
what you're doing and you know having

260
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,100
having stuff as organized as you can

261
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,820
it's really helpful we do have someone

262
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:23,390
to do that for us which is amazing but

263
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,910
but also kind of taking the downtime

264
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:29,090
when you can and anyone who is listening

265
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:31,100
that works freelance or runs a business

266
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,230
and probably you know especially if it's

267
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,820
in the early stages will know that you

268
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,620
don't really get time off you don't

269
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,300
really take weekends or holidays and

270
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,820
stuff but naturally this times the year

271
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,590
that are a bit quieter so over Christmas

272
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:45,200
obviously people don't really want much

273
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,500
awareness-raising or pen tests or an or

274
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,750
conference talks and stuff so it's

275
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,140
taking that downtime when

276
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,970
comes and looking after your health

277
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:57,420
really as much as possible I've been

278
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,370
traveling for work the whole time I've

279
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:02,270
been in the industry so after nine years

280
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:05,370
after seven years slip to disk and was

281
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,620
um was kind of coping with that for the

282
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,080
last couple of years and so yeah look

283
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,640
after your physical health you know and

284
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,680
your mental health because it does take

285
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,090
it out of you so you have to make sure

286
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:16,980
that you look after yourself first and

287
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:25,830
then you're able to do your job we

288
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:27,210
watched the Nightmare Before Christmas

289
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:30,420
last week and I said that I felt like if

290
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,840
she called Sammi the corpse pride I felt

291
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,610
like here sometimes like stitching

292
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:41,070
myself it does feel like that I mean

293
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:44,430
I've been I've been quite poorly for the

294
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,110
past couple of months and I think it's

295
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,850
just been a cold and I do I feel like

296
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,070
I'm coming out of it but it does take it

297
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,440
out of you and I think when you but we

298
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:52,740
don't

299
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,570
we've been nowhere near as busy as you

300
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,190
guys but we've kind of doing a

301
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,810
conference nearly every moment and then

302
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,340
we've got a lot of podcasts and all that

303
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:02,040
kind of stuff I think just the thinking

304
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,540
about it and the planning and getting

305
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,850
involved in it does wipe you out I found

306
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,560
it's wiped me out people talk about

307
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,720
conflict I've probably left every

308
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,790
conference this year two or three days

309
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,190
afterwards I've felt ill because of

310
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,710
being highly strung about it or you know

311
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,930
nervous about delivery of it and the

312
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,580
success of it that kind of stuff and I

313
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,830
think if that in itself isn't healthy

314
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,420
don't mind if you drinking or you're

315
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,280
eating crap food or all that kind of

316
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,380
thing I mean just the behavior of being

317
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:32,730
in the circuit can be quite tiresome and

318
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,680
have a profound impact on your health

319
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:41,580
yeah I was gonna say eight it's all of

320
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,900
the things that people don't really

321
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,240
think about like after a conference that

322
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,150
the hundreds of people that come up and

323
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:50,190
want photos or want to talk to you for a

324
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:52,590
while you can leave those feeling really

325
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:56,850
drained yeah it's a mental exhaustion

326
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,740
that you sort of come out really I'm not

327
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,150
godlike I thought I was gonna be easy

328
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:02,400
but actually I just need to sleep for a

329
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,080
couple

330
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,830
yeah I thought for me one of the things

331
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:10,580
that and I assume it's gonna be a even

332
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,560
worse we relaxed you guys were you guys

333
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,620
all around the globe given several talks

334
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,990
but let's also that lead up there's a

335
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,510
lot of preparation certainly from our

336
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,940
side I found like the amount that

337
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,589
actually goes into some of these things

338
00:14:24,589 --> 00:14:27,470
there's pretty significant a lot of time

339
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,910
does the seems like you throw a bunch of

340
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,500
slides together you get my stage to give

341
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,380
a talking the talk then it's not quite

342
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:36,200
the case so how do you guys cope with

343
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,510
that I mean there must take a lot of

344
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,910
work to to give a lot of these talks in

345
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,430
that yeah I think that that sort of read

346
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:46,360
you've hit on what differentiates just

347
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,250
casual speakers and professional

348
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,920
speaking is you have to put in a lot of

349
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,630
work we got a lot of people that kind of

350
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:56,209
come ask us to do a free talk for this

351
00:14:56,209 --> 00:14:58,850
or that or or just incredibly low price

352
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,890
and they go well you're only onstage for

353
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:01,790
half an hour right

354
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,920
yeah but it's actually 20 years of

355
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,350
experience and three days of time sort

356
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,329
of build up that the talk that you

357
00:15:08,329 --> 00:15:10,910
require they don't see all with the work

358
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,680
that goes into it and it's it that can

359
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,750
be really tough if you don't plan for if

360
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,760
you're not if you saw just go okay I've

361
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,260
got a talk next week I'm just going to

362
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,410
do the slides at the last minute and

363
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,760
it's never going to be as good or as

364
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,970
polished as the client needs yeah and I

365
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,020
think when you're passionate about it

366
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,850
you want to do the best job that you can

367
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:32,329
and so obviously that means preparing as

368
00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:35,089
much as possible and you know preparing

369
00:15:35,089 --> 00:15:36,589
it so that it's it's right for the

370
00:15:36,589 --> 00:15:38,000
people in the room and that they're

371
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,029
going to get the most value from it and

372
00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:42,680
so that you can then really feel good

373
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,570
when you leave knowing that you gave it

374
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,480
your all which is is great and I think

375
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,770
it's the right way to approach it

376
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:51,079
of course that takes time and you have

377
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:53,000
to build that in and and be aware of

378
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,220
that I just think when when

379
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:00,189
they say oh I get really nervous before

380
00:16:00,189 --> 00:16:02,170
a talking start like do you get nervous

381
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,480
like speaking in front of like hundreds

382
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,480
or thousands of people Jess and I have a

383
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,980
thing where we we don't really get

384
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,480
nervous about giving a talk but we're

385
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:17,490
more nervous about the client being so

386
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:22,930
it's like making peace yeah

387
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:25,389
but making sure that the client gets

388
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:27,699
what they wanted you know with that

389
00:16:27,699 --> 00:16:29,379
we've delivered the best thing that we

390
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:32,949
can and I think if you're not planning

391
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:35,709
for that then it's never gonna be as

392
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:38,110
good as it could be yes so I have just

393
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:40,300
kind of a question is a bit personal but

394
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,759
I mean obviously you both have got a

395
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:44,800
huge profile in the information security

396
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,279
community how do you keep connected

397
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:50,470
between just the two of yourselves I

398
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:53,829
mean clearly the demands of the public

399
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:56,050
and the demands of the clients are huge

400
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,240
how do you carve out enough time for

401
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:58,899
yourselves

402
00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:04,869
we just tweet each other liking and

403
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:06,970
sharing Oh Ryan Reynolds type of

404
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:16,299
relationship is that Wow yeah we like

405
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:18,280
like if says we try and take the time

406
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,409
out that we can whenever we can it if

407
00:17:20,409 --> 00:17:22,329
the clients willing to pay for us to be

408
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:23,980
in a country for another day or two

409
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:27,400
we'll take it if if we get to a weekend

410
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,799
and there happens to be a it's more

411
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,289
about a work to be done then then we'll

412
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:33,640
get that down quickly and then just

413
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,400
chill out watch a movie just try and

414
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,720
make as much time as you can for each

415
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,909
other don't we I actually think working

416
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:42,730
together it's it's kind of demanding in

417
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,320
one way when you're a couple but I think

418
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,740
it's it works so well for us yeah and if

419
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,480
if just one of us was running the

420
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,100
business and the other one was kind of

421
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,760
doing a job somewhere else then it would

422
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,409
be harder probably for us to stay

423
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,539
connected like we're going in the same

424
00:17:58,539 --> 00:18:00,010
direction we work on the business

425
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:03,700
together so that actually I think is

426
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,380
something that that's really beneficial

427
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:09,130
for us I agree I think that sorry FCI I

428
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,370
think the

429
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:13,370
section is that you are a an incredibly

430
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:15,650
strong unit and I think it's partly down

431
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:16,640
to the point I meant at the beginning

432
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,860
that you come a basis around what we're

433
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,450
trying to achieve you know we all do

434
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:22,130
kind of our own individual little things

435
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,350
to contribute to the the betterment of

436
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:26,090
the industry insecurity generally I

437
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:28,370
think you combine in such a way that

438
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,830
people probably just assume that you are

439
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:33,500
the package as it were that makes any

440
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,960
kind of sense some may even know that

441
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,970
we're married which is really weird well

442
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:48,410
that's a pretty good upset well listen

443
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:51,740
we've got one minute left and just a

444
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,970
quick one really what have you got

450
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,710
it's kind of it's an intro to

451
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,870
cybersecurity particularly for those who

452
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:20,330
are early on in my career in the

453
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,190

454

books great for pen testers mine is kind

456
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,840

457
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,610
look at the industry from the human the

458
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:40,880

459
