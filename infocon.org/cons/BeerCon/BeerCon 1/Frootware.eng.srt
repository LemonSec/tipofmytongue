1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:05,220
hey everyone welcome back mark and Ian

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,020
have just stepped away so are we

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,230
carrying on forward would like to

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,910
welcome fruit fruit thanks for coming on

5
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,760
so we haven't really got to agenda it's

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,550
just been very informal so it's what you

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,279
want to talk about so perhaps maybe

8
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,310
start off with just giving a brief

9
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:28,019
overview introduction of yourself and

10
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:30,060
what it is you do

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,300
so I'm fruit or fruit where I as the

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,410
site says I'm a university student and a

13
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,950
software engineer and I'm also a

14
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,300
moderator with the mini-hats club

15
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:48,059
because party I don't know I'm really

16
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:54,860
bad at this I'm largely intially I

17
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,940
didn't really bad for this whole I'm

18
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,660
very sorry but um I was kind of thinking

19
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,609
like psychology around security because

20
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:04,319
I know I talk a lot about like impostor

21
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,409
syndrome and there is a tweet that I was

22
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:09,210
reminded of recently where I was like I

23
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:16,650
want to be the Elwood's of InfoSec cool

24
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,710
yeah I mean it's just really informal so

25
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:24,869
yeah I mean that's great so I are you

26
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:26,939
more focus on the kind of mental health

27
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:32,280
aspect or what attackers think what kind

28
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,130
of side are you approaching from the in

29
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,439
terms of that I'm kind of looking at

30
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,329
kind of all sorts of angles when I talk

31
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:41,570
about like psychology our own security

32
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,649
so I'm kind of like thinking things like

33
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:45,659
impostor syndrome and I'm thinking about

34
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,500
like how we can optimize things

35
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,869
involving like users and sis up mins and

36
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:53,159
everything involved with that like the

37
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,220
entire security ecosystem but also

38
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,579
things like how attackers think and how

39
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:02,759
defenders think and it's just a weird

40
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:05,280
amalgamation of thoughts that don't

41
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,568
really make a lot of sense easily um but

42
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:12,180
I'm kind of always thinking about how

43
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,230
things see

44
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,319
and how things may be looked at I know

45
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,319
recently we've been working on a mini

46
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,420
project at work and they gave me the

47
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,150
security research tasks on how to secure

48
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,230
the application and then my boss read it

49
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,360
and he was like should we be worried

50
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,760
cuz you you knew exactly how you would

51
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,420
go about like attacking those clients

52
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,269
and everything and I'm like that's what

53
00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:45,690
you need in a security report yeah I

54
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,569
mean you come a spot on there so one of

55
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:51,569
the things I think people don't realize

56
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:53,790
is especially when it comes to attacking

57
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,459
system it's it's not that those doing it

58
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:59,099
are so geniuses and that some of them

59
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:01,620
are not to downplay that but a lot of

60
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,540
the times it's just thinking of a

61
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,280
different way I mean many other things

62
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,340
I've found is just using the system

63
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,709
against itself like never intended or

64
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:12,840
thinking about it so it sounds like you

65
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,129
focused on that and applying that so how

66
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:20,069
can organizations help themselves try to

67
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:21,510
do more of that so they can help protect

68
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:27,690
themselves mmm I'm with that it's kind

69
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,549
of like I know a lot of security we talk

70
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:32,010
about how we is a whole lot of mindset

71
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,459
but really it's like think about your

72
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:38,489
organization organizational systems as a

73
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:40,709
bank and you're a robber trying to get

74
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:44,519
into the vault and like how would you

75
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:48,760
approach everything to get the money

76
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,439
and that's kind of how I started to

77
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,489
approach these things when I was

78
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:57,310
starting to think about it and but

79
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,170
overall sorry I was just picking up my

80
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,920
laptop overall it's a it's a it's a lot

81
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,129
of

82
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,040
My Mind's disappeared for a second I'm

83
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:18,889
sorry I owe that it's listen to advice

84
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:20,810
that's being given from the industry

85
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:24,380
first of all and because a lot of the

86
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,300
time the advice that's given by the

87
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,340
industry it's things that we've seen

88
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:32,380
time and time and time again and and

89
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:37,310
think about like I want to be able to

90
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:40,580
get for example like access to the smart

91
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,320
metering network so I can take down the

92
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,630
infrastructure how do I do about go

93
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,370
about it what's the weakest link in the

94
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,520
chain and unfortunately a lot of the

95
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,490
time it's the support center because

96
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,400
those people aren't paid of works and

97
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,780
just bloody tired they're just bloody

98
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,590
tired of it all like um when I was

99
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:06,050
working in tech support for some

100
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,550
low-level government agencies I knew

101
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:12,950
that um some of it was public policy and

102
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,510
process where I was like this isn't on

103
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:17,030
but I can't do anything about it where

104
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,940
for example I had a user call in saying

105
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,070
that they'd forgotten not only their

106
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,919
password but also their user name for a

107
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:28,479
system that accessed medical records and

108
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,100
there was no policy in place for me to

109
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:38,780
say no I had to give it to them or at

110
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,860
least I had to get the user name we

111
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:43,880
didn't handle the passwords of it and it

112
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,800
was just I was so grateful for the

113
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,060
people handling the passwords because

114
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,500
they said I'm not comfortable doing the

115
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,090
password if they don't know the user

116
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,220
name that's like I wasn't comfortable

117
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:57,140
either but I had to UM and I was so

118
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,910
grateful that that other person kind of

119
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:05,390
agreed that they sounded dodgy yeah I

120
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,400
mean that's that's that's kind of scary

121
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,380
I mean we've heard many stories of the

122
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,930
attackers social engineering to the help

123
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:18,470
desk and it they easy target because I

124
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:21,520
guess at the end of the day

125
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,160
the table desks is there to help the

126
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:30,130
user and how did they know yeah I'm one

127
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,449
thing that I brought recently on Twitter

128
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:33,789
when talking about like kind of security

129
00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:37,300
ecosystem is a lot of people outside of

130
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:41,349
security in tech view everyone involved

131
00:06:41,349 --> 00:06:43,180
with maintaining the IT systems whether

132
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,770
that's security whether that sysadmin

133
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,419
whether it's just tech support generally

134
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:49,990
eyes in air quotes vit nodes in the

135
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:53,470
basement it considered them as something

136
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,539
separate from what the business does

137
00:06:55,539 --> 00:06:58,060
just by the fact without them the

138
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,470
business probably wouldn't be running

139
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:04,440
anywhere near as efficiently well and

140
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,580
one thing I always remember is I always

141
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,490
remember another thing I said was like

142
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,470
unfortunately a lot of uses kind of see

143
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,909
things like security training I

144
00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:18,699
something that detracts takes away from

145
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:22,560
their job rather than something that is

146
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,639
necessary to secure that job and then

147
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:29,050
seem like I'm like watching the chat as

148
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,610
well I'm seeing people say things like

149
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,380
so many Poly's policies so little

150
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,960
enforcement and I think that goes back

151
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,780
to you things like the security has to

152
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,580
be convenient or it's never going to be

153
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:43,570
implemented properly and a lot of the

154
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:46,389
time or at least I felt this way when I

155
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:48,130
was doing tech support things a lot of

156
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,770
the time people feel like the security

157
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:55,050
policy is there to get in the way yeah

158
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,130
it's an interesting work group because

159
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:59,319
you're absolutely right security

160
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:00,969
controls whether they're technical

161
00:08:00,969 --> 00:08:02,469
controls whether they're policies

162
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:06,069
processes or whatever it's got to be a

163
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,199
balance because the minute that you

164
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:11,349
introduce a rigid security control into

165
00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:13,330
an organization is the minute that the

166
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:16,380
organization tries to work around it

167
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,479
therein is the risk so the more

168
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:21,340
difficult you make security for people

169
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:25,120
to adopt than to run with then the more

170
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,310
likely they are realistically to try and

171
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,599
abandon it and do something different

172
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:30,580
which they introduce new risk and you

173
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:33,320
control fails from day one

174
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,070
absolutely I know that there have been

175
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:40,940
times where I've said like look this

176
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,030
isn't okay this could potentially be

177
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,710
something major back when I was working

178
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:50,330
with the organization that was

179
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,910
contracted to support government people

180
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:56,720
and I was finding things like for

181
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,730
example like these three uses for some

182
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,620
reason have it have their set profile

183
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,900
set up so you can remote onto their

184
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,810
systems without their permission

185
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:09,290
which doesn't sound good no the best of

186
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:12,140
times and these are people handling

187
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:17,540
financial stuff do you think a lot of it

188
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,540
could also be the war so I mean it's

189
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,980
coming back to the point where we put

190
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,590
Bridgette controls in and it's all very

191
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,210
good but they and I think all those

192
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,920
people are just putting in just to make

193
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,180
my life difficult and and your example

194
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,320
perhaps they don't understand the

195
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,480
repercussions of what that actually

196
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,730
means so the thing with this is these

197
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,980
users didn't have access to the active

198
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,510
layer directory stuff involved with

199
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,850
their profiles that that specific tab in

200
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,410
Active Directory wasn't touched by our

201
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:46,700
second one sport or anyone who's

202
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,110
involved was setting up the profiles

203
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:50,510
they just had that one tip those three

204
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:55,700
users however think 8000 um and I was I

205
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,380
went to my manager as part of this

206
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,810
secure like policy like this looks like

207
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,520
something that could be major this

208
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,170
should probably get looked into and my

209
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,730
management literally turned around and

210
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,040
said oh well as long as the systems are

211
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,819
working I don't care

212
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:13,700
greater and then there was another time

213
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,830
where the same department had reported

214
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:20,030
Trojan in some of the work from home

215
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:23,330
service that they had and they reported

216
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,820
that at like 2:00 a.m. 3:00 a.m. and I

217
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,290
found the ticket at 8:00 a.m. when my

218
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,450
shift started and so I was like I need

219
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:31,130
call incident management because that's

220
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:31,790
the process

221
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,920
my manager turned her on said when they

222
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,960
call you and I said they didn't this is

223
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,040
a ticket that got race with you

224
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,290
overnight team and they were like my

225
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,090
manager was like if they didn't call you

226
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,950
you're not raising it this doesn't go to

227
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,480
I am they need to call they need to wait

228
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,030
until 8:00 8:00 a.m. to call the cinema

229
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:51,410
yes because leaving a Trojan unbothered

230
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:54,140
and with unfettered access for five

231
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:58,550
hours is an excellent idea and yeah

232
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,840
ended up watching that ticket like a

233
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,390
hawk and it actually ended up blowing

234
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:07,010
SLA and getting thrown into a team that

235
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:09,860
had no people in it fantastic yeah it

236
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,660
was it was a [ __ ] show it was a false

237
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:15,320
positive fortunately but at the same

238
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,940
time like these things need to be better

239
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:22,130
managed and they often aren't agreed got

240
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,910
a question for you fruit about yourself

241
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:29,240
nothing to prying I promise you okay you

242
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,760
know we've known each other for a couple

243
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,710
years I think now it's cool yeah that

244
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:37,250
kind of time and we've met many many

245
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,840
times on the on the conference circuit

246
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,570
over the last 18 once that's fair to say

247
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:46,010
and we tried about your career and dare

248
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,630
I say that was even potential

249
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,160
opportunity for you to have come worked

250
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:54,589
with me that nearly nearly happy it

251
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:55,520
would have been great but your

252
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,530
circumstances didn't prevent that from

253
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:59,420
practice that's fair yeah but now you

254
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,990
you uprooted yourself yeah and you now

255
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,400
that cannot other end of the country

256
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,580
from where you were previously and

257
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,170
you've got you you planted your feet in

258
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:10,970
a role and you you're cracking on with

259
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,350
things how are you finding it from where

260
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,820
you were when we first talked about

261
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,950
stuff how you find in your life and your

262
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,420
personal development how's that panning

263
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,930
out for you

264
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:23,020
no I was always saying when I was

265
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,000
working in helpdesk like to everyone

266
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,710
who's like asked me about jobs and

267
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,360
careers and things like I want something

268
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,860
that challenges me I want something

269
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,510
where I actually feel myself learning

270
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:34,120
and growing I'm bored as [ __ ] to put it

271
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,839
bluntly yeah and this is definitely

272
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,250
something that challenges me I'm not

273
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,230
much of a dev um

274
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:45,520
despite being hired as a dev and so

275
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,190
every day I'm kind of like having minor

276
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:53,020
breakdowns in front loj and we all do

277
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,420
that because I don't know how about to

278
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,930
approach anything but I'm loving it good

279
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:01,089
because I'm getting to learn and grow it

280
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:03,420
it's something that's challenging me I

281
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,830
mean I'm also walking into work every

282
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:07,300
day thinking this is a day I'm going to

283
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:13,450
get that's also life working in security

284
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,150
or something you're only one day a

285
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:19,470
breach away from the door I think

286
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:24,870
certainly more senior you are I think

287
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,790
and if there's no data breaches

288
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:30,430
happening and that's the case for a very

289
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,470
long time

290
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,910
some of the more senior management who

291
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,290
may like generally within the

292
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,000
organization who may not understand what

293
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,680
the need of security is might turn

294
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,420
around and say well what's the point in

295
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,589
paying these people if nothing's

296
00:13:41,589 --> 00:13:42,130
happening

297
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:44,320
this would really really point somebody

298
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,120
I mean it's a really it's a well-known

299
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,190
statement in the industry but somebody

300
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,510
that I follow on Twitter has got it as

301
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,820
their kind of little bio and what it

302
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:55,600
says is worth sley effective security is

303
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,839
too much until it's not enough yeah and

304
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:01,120
I think that is a difficult barriers who

305
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,620
I would come in there in the enterprises

306
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,930
that well actually what we're gaining

307
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:07,240
against his is things happening so what

308
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,650
we try to ensure is that nothing happens

309
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:13,570
yes so your your return on investment is

310
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:16,860
a dark entity it's nothing

311
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,190
but that's good

312
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:25,029
a person who spoke Lundy at the London

313
00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:27,010
Navy haka society unfortunately I've

314
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:29,320
forgotten his name but he did a really

315
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,100
really good talk on risk yeah and he

316
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,130
kind of opened it

317
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:37,280
like very mundane things like what would

318
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,110
you rather hug the baby or the bear

319
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,570
yeah and it's things like people die

320
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:43,760
more from like incidents with babies and

321
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,530
they do with incidents from bears but

322
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:46,850
people would be more likely to hook the

323
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,770
baby because like rescue exception is

324
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:53,030
it's it's also awareness so yeah there's

325
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,700
like oh people aren't aware that you

326
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,070
could probably have more diseases from a

327
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:01,850
baby and a bit more by bit so I think

328
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:05,390
awareness is also big yeah it's a good

329
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,560
point and I think I'm actually getting a

330
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,630
count remember Marvin with Dave Kennedy

331
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:11,720
earlier when you're talking about risk

332
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,030
the enterprise level you're not talking

333
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,920
about cross-site scripting you not

334
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,900
talking about sequel injection and stuff

335
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,100
like that you're not even talking about

336
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,250
our day servers that are in your network

337
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,370
you're talking about company closure and

338
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:27,010
you're talking about job losses and

339
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,240
directors may be in prison and that's

340
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,440
the kind of language you need to be

341
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,330
using in the board room when you when

342
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:35,090
you discuss mask and then obviously when

343
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,580
you delve into the the myth the

344
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,230
causative factors of the risk then

345
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,130
you're talking about

346
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:43,580
vulnerable software outdated life cycle

347
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,070
management so it's interesting that the

348
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,930
different levels of conversation you

349
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,370
need to have within a company when

350
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:50,480
you're talking to an engineer or a

351
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,310
software developer or whatever yeah and

352
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,320
going this in the boardroom with the

353
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,060
c-suite people and it's a completely

354
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:00,800
different I think that kind of stems

355
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,530
back to an idea that got into my head

356
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,950
when I was working helpdesk still and we

357
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,750
always had like people checking over our

358
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,610
calls doing quality quality quality and

359
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:13,970
and the quality person came over to my

360
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,740
desk once and I thought I was in trouble

361
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,150
for something and I was like what have I

362
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,530
said on a call that's about to get me

363
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,810
fired and she's just kind of crouched

364
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,550
down by my desk and she was like I just

365
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,590
want to say you were really good at

366
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,840
breaking things down so that people

367
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,230
understand what's going on yeah awesome

368
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:32,410
and it was making me think about it and

369
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,700
how that can be applied to like other

370
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,490
things within attack because it is

371
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:40,280
really a fine line between breaking a

372
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,860
concept or an idea down so that it's

373
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,480
understood by the person you're talking

374
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,510
to without breaking it down so much that

375
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,020
they feel

376
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,790
you're patronizing them yeah absolutely

377
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:53,540
right and it's a blog post that I keep

378
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,190
thinking about writing and then I never

379
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:58,370
do about like how to talk text to

380
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:02,420
non-technical people and I still need to

381
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,770
write that it's been in my head like the

382
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:05,030
idea has been in my head for like two

383
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:08,170
years and I just never got around to it

384
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:11,000
yeah I think that plastic many of us

385
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,750
that write blogs I've got I think about

386
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:17,750
50 blog posts that are in draft yeah

387
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,910
I've had I've had one that was like

388
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,949
breaking down everything involving all

389
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:25,010
DNS a ransom was and because that was

390
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,650
the year I got into InfoSec 2017 is when

391
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:30,080
I got into InfoSec and that all happens

392
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,520
and it's hilarious because it was the

393
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,080
first encrypting ransomware that got me

394
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,460
into a second in the first place like

395
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,320
considering that this is an actual thing

396
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,330
it's not just something from the

397
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:43,010
brightly-colored hackers movie that I

398
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:48,500
have loved my entire life yeah quite so

399
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,480
you are in fact a child of the marriage

400
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,470
of eternal blue a double Poulter I

401
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,510
suppose I am yeah yes I guess that's the

402
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:59,480
case looking at aspects I mean the one

403
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,550
that really got me into like info second

404
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:05,000
thinking about it was actually because I

405
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,210
had been training as a chef and I got to

406
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:09,260
leave that because I was getting too

407
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:12,320
anxious in the kitchen and and I was

408
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,610
kind of sitting at home and I was on

409
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:16,520
like a writing community I mean and we

410
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,830
were like it was during the time of

411
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:22,670
cryptolocker okay and the writing

412
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:25,100
community was freaking out about it and

413
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,200
they were like making these huge posts

414
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,900
about like what it's doing what like how

415
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,620
to avoid it and like etc etc it was huge

416
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,480
amounts of it of information about it

417
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,040
being compiled from people like sofas

418
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,870
and and meinster on a blank but I know

419
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:47,390
it's K kaspersky the money and that's

420
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:49,790
the rich yeah so like soffits and

421
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,290
kaspersky they were pulling things from

422
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:53,660
like the analysis reports from them it's

423
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,179
kind of discuss what's happening and

424
00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:57,679
everyone I knew was like freaking out

425
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:58,790
like oh my god and they're gonna get

426
00:18:58,790 --> 00:18:59,990
cryptolocker am I gonna get creek

427
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,250
am I gonna coach a look and I was

428
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:05,600
sitting here thinking cool um just just

429
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,520
just that I was just like this is really

430
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:12,340
cool and then my dad got hit with it and

431
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:15,410
he spent seven or eight hours I think it

432
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:21,080
was decrypting his drives well because

433
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,550
my parents are both like complete tech

434
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:27,710
heads as well so my dad probably could

435
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,360
have done it quicker if I hadn't been

436
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,420
booking him every couple of hours to

437
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:44,750
look at it go away and I'm like it's the

438
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,800
way you're gonna learn stuff though

439
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,390
right yeah

440
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,950
and I think that's one thing that I

441
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:51,440
really love about InfoSec it's like this

442
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,700
the capacity to be curious look I'm

443
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,590
working on getting together a malware

444
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,300
lab so I can do like a malware of the

445
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,910
month cuz what I'd love to do is now our

446
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,920
analysis and EFI are as much as I talked

447
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,450
about like psychology and security

448
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:08,210
because that's what my brain gets at the

449
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:12,190
moment yeah cuz I've studied psychology

450
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:14,360
for a while I've been interested in it

451
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:19,070
for a while and the only thing I could

452
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:21,170
feel capable of talking about yes

453
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,630
awesome well listen for it we're out of

454
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:26,660
time oh no no that was really really

455
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,970
good and and it's great to see that

456
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:31,430

you've been on a beverage journey it's

458
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,480
been a fascinating how its ups and downs

459
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,290
I think it's fast luckily it sounds like

460
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:41,810
it's got plenty of ups at the moment so
