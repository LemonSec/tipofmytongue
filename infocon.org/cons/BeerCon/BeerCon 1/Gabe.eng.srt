1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,870
all right thanks welcome back our next

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,870
guest is gay thank you for joining me

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:11,820
you do any maybe just give a bit of a

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,620
background about yourself and what does

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,540
she do

6
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:19,350
thing so particularly earlier when I got

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,060
a chance to listen in I think it was

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,260
around when Scott was on I we focused a

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,480
bit on coming up as assistant and and

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,710
that sort of touched my heart because

11
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,869
that was my route into security as well

12
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:35,010
so um started out my first real stint in

13
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,920
tech was doing support for a Lotus Notes

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,660
system I'd never never seen before but

15
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,340
hadn't blocked my way into because I had

16
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,750
no idea what Lotus Notes was in thought

17
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,980
was something else entirely

18
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,830
and from that I ended up into a sort of

19
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:50,530
a general assisted men trajectory once I

20
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,360
got out of that particular sector and

21
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,280
ended up in heavy industry heavy

22
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,190
industry was bei opening as to how

23
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,110
business works cuz and the role

24
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,840
technology in business because really

25
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,510
didn't matter as long as the kimmm kept

26
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:07,450
pumping out concrete and cement I cement

27
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:10,960
it specifically but I also that let me

28
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,510
be a sort of a old-school bastard

29
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,280
operators from hell in terms of power of

30
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,470
Agra local area because they needed

31
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:20,380
someone local wave far away from work

32
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,119
that I could actually get things done in

33
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:24,070
six things and skated networks and stuff

34
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,540
like that and so that gave me a lot of

35
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:29,200
room to grow which I took both hands but

36
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,780
that also is what led me into security

37
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,030
primarily because the previous guy who I

38
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,530
replaced had booked a security course

39
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,649
before he quit found out I loved almost

40
00:01:38,649 --> 00:01:41,950
every aspect of it from there I've sort

41
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:46,960
of them taken a view into from there I

42
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,850
actually went into audit briefly looked

43
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,289
at a lot of lot of levels of the

44
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:51,819
business and a lot more than just

45
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:53,890
traditional security stuff they really

46
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:59,110
tried to multi skill us and also sort of

47
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,789
in doctrine us in a sort of worldview

48
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:02,289
because I went to fourteen countries in

49
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:05,259
two years landed here and thank you Glee

50
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:07,959
when I left his retirement charity have

51
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:11,760
been major projects and now I do

52
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,020
effectively Enterprise client security

53
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,090
architecture and consultancy but all

54
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,920
internal stuff Simon's Blue team all the

55
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,459
way I've briefly been a supplier in the

56
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:23,200
past in terms of consultancy and stuff

57
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:23,770
like that

58
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,270
and I've done some contract work but

59
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:29,069
most of my time and the defender tape

60
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:34,290
awesome so I see you mentioned cloud

61
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,170
what sort of different and you also

62
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:43,569
mentioned you came from what sort of the

63
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:46,450
biggest challenges facing tired and that

64
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,580
many people perhaps don't realise when a

65
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:53,610
new scarred well the Communist turned

66
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:57,370
accurate in 99% of cases that you have

67
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:57,950
when it's

68
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,950
just says do we do cloud is that they

69
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,870
take a lift and shift approach which

70
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,099
just doesn't work because yeah well

71
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:07,790
engineering is different

72
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:12,470
yeah so you testified brother I I

73
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,840
completely agree with that moving a

74
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,060
crappy app from on-premise to the cloud

75
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,760
just means you have a crappy app running

76
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,610
in the cloud right yes usually week a

77
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,110
completely different attack surface that

78
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,450
you no longer understand perfect because

79
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,099
you've disabled security in order to

80
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:30,980
make it work yeah he's really come

81
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:35,750
bleeding yeah so the one view that I

82
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,000
take a look at cloud is like open

83
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,620
databases and to me this is perhaps the

84
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,640
pinnacle example of where I feel that

85
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,459
security is often taking a back end with

86
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:54,349
the whole drive into cloud in terms of

87
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:57,530
architecture point of view what are your

88
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,140
thoughts on that

89
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,230
well it depends heavily on a lot of

90
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:07,250
factors but let's go in just thinking

91
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:12,549
about some of my own experiences I think

92
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:16,279
well I'm firmly of the opinion so

93
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,988
starting out here I'm firmly of the

94
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:19,910
opinion that as a industry and

95
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,070
particularly as a community we are

96
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,380
vastly adaptive shooting ourselves and

97
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,729
the foot when we talk to the business

98
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:27,590
and we always have been and you know all

99
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,370
the theories about it security teams who

100
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,650
say no and all the other fun stuff and

101
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,330
one of the things that we've said that

102
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:38,240
for for most of the last decade is no to

103
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,460
cloud right well cloud is still

104
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,970
happening so we often in a lot of cases

105
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,460
set up situations where we weren't

106
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,400
properly engaged in cloud or when we

107
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,289
were luckily engaged when that started

108
00:04:51,289 --> 00:04:52,010
to happen

109
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,710
you still had the case that the team was

110
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,880
not resource skilled up or aware of what

111
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,770
helping someone learn how to manage

112
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,599
cloud security looks like so they

113
00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:04,700
weren't in a good place to help out so I

114
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,590
would definitely say that in a large

115
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,909
number of businesses that pattern

116
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:10,250
happened and therefore security sort of

117
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:10,790
on the back

118
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,730
yeah but I would say that there you

119
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,740
shouldn't overlook the the aspect that

120
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,910
we're getting so many things wrong in a

121
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:24,710
cloud - simply because they're not only

122
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:27,320
is it a constantly evolving platform but

123
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,540
many things don't have safe defaults

124
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,000
that's just that the infrastructure is

125
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,980
so complex that there's no set of

126
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,720
defaults that will be safe and meet the

127
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,730
demands of the user base for whatever it

128
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,350
happens to be yeah

129
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,540
but coming back to the default so like

130
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:46,280
one example that I think that the tool

131
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:50,990
sets failed users is open databases so

132
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,610
if you take a look at like the likes of

133
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,400
elasticsearch when I first came out the

134
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,250
default was wide open and that's that

135
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,260
you have to pay to get extra security

136
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:04,400
around education and HTTPS so what are

137
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,080
your thoughts on that it's bonkers but

138
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,570
it's the way our economy works

139
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:15,050
essentially yeah it's both depending I

140
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,830
mean it depends on the motive for

141
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,750
developing the tool of course if it's a

142
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:26,540
proper traffic motive obviously but you

143
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,060
you wouldn't be looking at something

144
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,670
where as you can say deploy security by

145
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:34,490
paying extra money there if it's open

146
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,730
source of the various areas of social

147
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,310
pressure and praise that bee community

148
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,860
is good at throwing about in Twitter and

149
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,600
I'm also tongue-in-cheek about the

150
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,240
phrase bit of Twitter is often enough to

151
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,830
drive people in a given direction or

152
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,090
drive people away from the get into

153
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,460
action take a look at all of the people

154
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,990
sticking their heads in the sand around

155
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,520
various open source projects in the last

156
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,590
few years and explaining that certain

157
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:00,610
ridiculous features of simply by design

158
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:07,130
yeah that's it is nowhere in fact it's

159
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:09,080
horrible but it's an its way people are

160
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,030
and that's one of the reasons why were

161
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,970
so it's so important to age and all

162
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,800
levels of the staff at all different

163
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,500
types of people are so is there a

164
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,650
problem though with the idea that this

165
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,590
is a

166
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:25,410
a deaf problem this is a DevOps problem

167
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:28,800
or even an OPS problem is it is it sort

168
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,440
of kicking the can around between the

169
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,620
different traditional IT teams because

170
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,260
you hear the idea that basically hire a

171
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,150
full stack developer and all of this

172
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:43,020
goes away is it is that accurate that's

173
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:47,850
a lot to unpack so let me first make

174
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:51,150
sure I understand exactly who's in the

175
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,770
question we're talking about the

176
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,120
responsibility shifts for maintaining

177
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,130
managing securing cloud into a DevOps

178
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:58,830
team yeah as a possibly just being a

179
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,230
kick from kick of the can to developers

180
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,580
and it's just sort of pushed make me

181
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,810
someone else's fun but not actually

182
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,580
doing anything to fix the good clothes

183
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,250
yeah essentially is that an accurate

184
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,890
sort of assessment of where or some

185
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,170
businesses are or yeah

186
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:15,060
yes for some businesses but that's a

187
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,450
very vague statement so absolutely

188
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:22,350
people get along I am firmly of the

189
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:25,050
belief that that is the model to go for

190
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,790
so I do not think it's kicking the

191
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,800
camera okay I have seen phenomenal

192
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,720
models because I mean if you think about

193
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,080
it your code actually understands that

194
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,120
your eye your the massive the most

195
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,370
amount of cost that any given

196
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:44,159
application incurs in its lifetime is

197
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,610
after it's bit yes yeah great there's a

198
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:53,220
study that absolutely similarly yes IBM

199
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,840
study from 2010 I don't know if the same

200
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,880
one but I've been did a 2010 if study -

201
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,510
that shows that the cost of fixing

202
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,760
security bugs is something on the order

203
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,120
of 90 times the cost of any 90 times the

204
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,810
cost of anything

205
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:10,370
we tried once it's employed correct yeah

206
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:15,210
so those things developers are not there

207
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,670
to maintain stuff the same way because

208
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,830
most team organizations don't hire

209
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,480
developer and say for the rest of your

210
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,190
life you're going to be maintaining this

211
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,890
product nothing else yeah back in the

212
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:29,220
day it was that many issues has been

213
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,810
with it - so the instead the developers

214
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,420
going to get taxed on to a new project

215
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,779
and someone needs to make sure that wall

216
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:40,940
either changes updates whatever you

217
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:43,100
still maintain and update the cloud

218
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,019
infrastructure along at the same time so

219
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:47,149
yeah no I you really want a dedicated

220
00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:51,050
staff of now SR ease but it's just

221
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,700
admins of all the DevOps or whatever you

222
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,980
want to call them sitting along most

223
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,510
year after team's not necessarily

224
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:01,910
reporting the same way right well so do

225
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,579
you see companies approaching kardama

226
00:10:04,579 --> 00:10:07,310
totally ignorant manner I mean some

227
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:10,490
companies I think just simply assume

228
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:10,790
that

229
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:13,220
oh it's someone else's infrastructure so

230
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,480
therefore I don't have to worry about

231
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,880
things like network security and all

232
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,190
that that's all handled for me and tidy

233
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,800
oblivious to the whole kind of notion of

234
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,060
shared responsibility model I hear

235
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,070
people talking about that but I don't

236
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,769
really I haven't really seen anyone

237
00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:33,260
stick their head in the exam that far

238
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:38,800
deeply myself at least not

239
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:40,550
comprehensively

240
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,560
Bureau is going to have some people who

241
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,810
think that way and I'm sure there's tons

242
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,399
of people who have made that as a budget

243
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,060
decision and justified it I would argue

244
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:54,320
to probably know better well that's

245
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,810
that's actually encouraging - yes it

246
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,610
sounds like a lot of companies are going

247
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:02,990
into card with some decent little

248
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:06,649
amounts of knowledge which is good my

249
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:08,480
question is is how they tried it once

250
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,570
got hurt spent a lot of money and now

251
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:15,820
we're trying it again you know do we see

252
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:20,649
the we kind of see the dirt dirtiest of

253
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:24,019
failed cloud from the security

254
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:25,910
perspective of course when you know

255
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:28,519
sensitive data is breached but on the

256
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:30,769
other side of the fence are we getting

257
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:32,899
the numbers right Gabe like when when

258
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:35,630
you know you estimate the cost of doing

259
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:38,630
cloud it seems to me and this is just my

260
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:41,060
perspective from from being a guy that

261
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,899
looks at bills they it's that what's

262
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:48,710
projected is never anywhere close to

263
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:56,839
the actual costs end up being cost

264
00:11:56,839 --> 00:11:58,790
management well not my particular

265
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:01,730
discipline oh I prefer to build tools

266
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:04,640
and those tools usually cost money I

267
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,770
have resistance to manage large budgets

268
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:09,890
in the past - too much to my annoyance

269
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:12,500
sometimes but I'm very happy that this

270
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,910
is the first one years when I have

271
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:19,250
direct reports so cost management is a

272
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,220
huge and under managed discipline and

273
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:25,010
cloud so a company may understand shared

274
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,230
responsibilities coming in to a mile

275
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,810
degree like they may say om sensor and

276
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,130
they'll get your PCI controls wrong

277
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,870
still but their least under paths got

278
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:35,480
some concept of needing something to

279
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,040
replace the firewall in the cloud and

280
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,620
they learned what is security good this

281
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,940
doesn't mean figure it safely but

282
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,930
there's some clue but companies

283
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,190
constantly fall down one class meant and

284
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,750
it is very possible to manage it

285
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,000
honestly it needs dedicated with you and

286
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,130
time and careful use of different types

287
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:55,339
of instances also a lot of different

288
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:56,630
providers now have different plans

289
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,430
depending upon committed spending stuff

290
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:02,209
like that but that requires going into

291
00:13:02,209 --> 00:13:04,279
that knowing about those tools or being

292
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:06,320
big enough so that your cloud suppliers

293
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,709
tell you about

294
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:12,579
that's a great answer

295
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,300
yeah and what about the the new approach

296
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,940
which I've heard and seen recently is

297
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:23,920
the hybrid in my sort of hybrid model do

298
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,130
you have any sort of insights into that

299
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:30,070
I mean a hybrid model for what

300
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,750
infrastructure applicant what's why are

301
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,450
we hybridizing oh right so my

302
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,100
understanding and this is a rare term

303
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,080
it's like I think a relatively new term

304
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,210
so instead of having all your

305
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:42,130
infrastructure and cloud or all your

306
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:44,770
infrastructure unfriend we have come

307
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,600
with some of it in the cloud and some on

308
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,380
throw um well I don't think it's a new

309
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,000
model it's a model most companies first

310
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,890
started out with and it's all about

311
00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:04,930
designing for the so picking of the

312
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,040
better way to answer this actually so

313
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,570
it's all about designing for the use

314
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:08,890
case the business use case you have to

315
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,920
begin with you don't go to the cloud to

316
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,010
save money because that's horrible way

317
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:16,930
to go about it because it doesn't save

318
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:19,240
money in the long run not if you're

319
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,240
doing it the right way in my opinion you

320
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,280
go to the cloud to achieve certain

321
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,230
benefits from scalability or flexibility

322
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,030
that traditionally has never been able

323
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:31,360
to deliver on premise that doesn't mean

324
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,800
traditional IT and traditional

325
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,060
infrastructure doesn't have a role

326
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,650
doesn't mean that you would only

327
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:38,140
certainly consider extending parts of

328
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,840
that help to the cloud in absolutely

329
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,920
when you look at it from an

330
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,420
infrastructure perspective

331
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:47,590
aka traditional IT services yeah there's

332
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:50,770
huge value in going hybrid because if

333
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:53,050
you're what's right there's huge value

334
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:55,300
in going hybrid if you are an

335
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,530
established enterprise with an

336
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,030
established tech staff that you have to

337
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,460
maintain because the chance of you being

338
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,020
able to migrate all that type of with

339
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,880
that out of the cloud safely is probably

340
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,000
nil in because there's also probably a

341
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,470
lot of benefits to maintaining your

342
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,450
on-premise to expect the various reasons

343
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:11,590
that could go from security to

344
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:14,860
performance or anything like that but I

345
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:17,410
wouldn't necessarily marry any concept

346
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:22,360
of marrying my infrastructure to a new

347
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,090
product I was building I would keep that

348
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:25,699
in mind

349
00:15:25,699 --> 00:15:28,639
and have very special ways of

350
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,529
administering or doing it because why

351
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:31,850
would you want to link you the cloud

352
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,649
gives you the ability now to effectively

353
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:37,819
build a new environment whenever and

354
00:15:37,819 --> 00:15:39,109
wherever why would you want to try it

355
00:15:39,109 --> 00:15:41,179
why do you want to expose what you're

356
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:43,160
delivering to the attack surface of

357
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,579
today's modern corporate network yeah I

358
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:47,959
think that's a really good point and I

359
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:50,769
think you know the promise of office 365

360
00:15:50,769 --> 00:15:53,749
you know all cloud exchange works up

361
00:15:53,749 --> 00:15:55,730
until you find those integrated business

362
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:58,220
applications that turn out to be

363
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,079
critical and required an on-premise

364
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,319
exchange server and given that scenario

365
00:16:03,319 --> 00:16:06,730
you know I have a lot of sympathy for

366
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:08,660
organizations that don't make the

367
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:12,169
investment in training their their IT

368
00:16:12,169 --> 00:16:16,129
teams on cloud and cloud platforms and

369
00:16:16,129 --> 00:16:18,709
just expect digital transformation to

370
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:20,869
happen have you been in that situation

371
00:16:20,869 --> 00:16:22,790
where you've handed them a bill for

372
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:25,999
before we even start this I need these

373
00:16:25,999 --> 00:16:29,149
skill sets I need these tools I need you

374
00:16:29,149 --> 00:16:31,519
know I need I need is that a

375
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,929
conversation that's happening

376
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,339
I'm certain it's a conversation that has

377
00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:39,259
happened and I'm certainly aware of some

378
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:40,639
cases where it's happened in

379
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,470
organizations I've worked in I've never

380
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,870
personally been involved that early on

381
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,879
despite a lot of campaigning to trying

382
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:49,250
to do so when I was heavily involved in

383
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,319
a number of migration projects some

384
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:57,259
years ago I was in I this I was involved

385
00:16:57,259 --> 00:16:59,660
but even then I was usually involved

386
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:02,300
later than I would like even with full

387
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,130
agreement from every senior stakeholder

388
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,510
on the role of security in it

389
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:08,209
chef CMC the nature of organizations I

390
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:09,919
mean in this particular case sometimes

391
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,559
organizations are also perpetually

392
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,040
disorganized

393
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,599
that's that's I think a really accurate

394
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,359
state state of the cloud that it seems

395
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:22,490
like the balance between either you've

396
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,079
gone ahead and hired you know a guy like

397
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,720
yourself cloud architect cloud security

398
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,330
architect lots of experience or even

399
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,490
hired a consulting firm to get you there

400
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:34,250
and then you know the business doesn't

401
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:37,640
really want to understand or comprehend

402
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,190
you know what the end state or the

403
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:43,610
vision of it is and then back again the

404
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:46,309
vision of the business just doesn't line

405
00:17:46,309 --> 00:17:49,100
up with it with the skill set of of the

406
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,030
team and it seems to me that a good

407
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,340
project manager for a cloud or digital

408
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,799
transformation project is really going

409
00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:00,110
to have to look at both of those and

410
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,570
actually get those business requirements

411
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:04,790
and align them to that the cloud

412
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:08,390
requirement is it your opinion how does

413
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:11,630
it fall apart that because we've we've

414
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:14,500
seen kind of a lot of cloud of messes I

415
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,360
used to fly some project manager yeah

416
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,340
okay I think that you nailed it there if

417
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,799
the consultancy is supplying the project

418
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,350
manager

419
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,450
you often earned for world of hurt I'm

420
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,039
not throwing stones at consultancies in

421
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:32,230
this one right right it's the fact that

422
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:34,240
the nature of engagement the nature of

423
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,740
driving something this intricate though

424
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,990
it means someone who has a lot more

425
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,280
organizational knowledge then your third

426
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,419
plague is going to be able to do on

427
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:43,600
their own there's an overwhelming belief

428
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,820
soul bones obviously failed to deliver

429
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,039
that sometimes that you can hire so I'm

430
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:49,539
going to do the migration in a pain-free

431
00:18:49,539 --> 00:18:51,520
fashion and I've seen some truly

432
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,230
horrible it is in business cases and

433
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,940
torn them down one at science too and

434
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,830
I've seen some with really good

435
00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:00,280
consultants too but given how hard it is

436
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,210
to hire really good people and given how

437
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,039
many people are out there in the middle

438
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:07,570
tier of the consultancy market in the

439
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,510
value had a piece on the market yeah

440
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:12,730
yeah there's a there's a high chance

441
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:14,169
that you may or may not get the right

442
00:19:14,169 --> 00:19:17,080
people yeah and then when you don't I

443
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,150
mean ultimately it's those people that

444
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,220
you're going to rely on for delivery EDD

445
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,880
and and then just the costs escalate

446
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,039
because the the worst thing about a

447
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,950
cloud project is a 3/4 implemented cloud

448
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,559
project and then a change of the project

449
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:33,970
team were a change in the business

450
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:38,470
requirements that you have to always

451
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,640
plan if a change in the business

452
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:44,110
requirements anticipate that it won't

453
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:47,140
look like anything that it started like

454
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,210
well no I mean it's

455
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:54,190
if you it's the nature of the beast some

456
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,929
of the I would nominal gonna name names

457
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:57,789
but some of the major cloud platforms

458
00:19:57,789 --> 00:19:59,890
are effectively still in beta they

459
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,260
change capabilities change design

460
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,030
requirements change you may have to be a

461
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,740
detective refactor the network design

462
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,870
six months into a project you take

463
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,549
advantage of a new feature or did you

464
00:20:09,549 --> 00:20:10,780
find out about the limitation that

465
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,659
happens that's kind of insane that's

466
00:20:13,659 --> 00:20:17,200
like building a house on on ground that

467
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,780
you're not even sure what's under under

468
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:25,480
the sand right not if you're doing it in

469
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,730
a completely new expansion all right

470
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:31,450
okay but I'm talking about established

471
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:33,190
teams for building and supporting this

472
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,690
and I'm not talking about somebody goes

473
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:37,210
in and logs into a switch to be

474
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:39,309
configure every single port to be in a

475
00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:39,840
different beat

476
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,610
or apply a script to do that 220

477
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,950
switches in hope it all works I'm

478
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:46,080
talking about when you're doing it when

479
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,300
you are actually going cloud native when

480
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,610
you're deploying your instances as code

481
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:52,470
when you're designing your network desk

482
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,700
Odin so what you're doing is you're

483
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,620
changing terraform code or something

484
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,920
like that and right okay

485
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,080
and I don't mean you I would not love to

486
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,030
be more careful I don't mean you been

487
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:06,270
God God know that something is seriously

488
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:13,140
wrong with the organization yeah but it

489
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,340
also means but that's not because that

490
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:19,050
is so that's just a side effect the

491
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:20,280
point of driving I is that because

492
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,710
that's the nature of the beast

493
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:25,320
then the organization is used to that

494
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,140
type of fast deliver which is why you

495
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,370
really do need to be working closely

496
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:30,840
with the business as it still is written

497
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,070
to be able to continue to shape that

498
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:37,050
journey because the change can easily be

499
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:39,540
driven by some one higher up or someone

500
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,700
or a customer or someone saying give me

501
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:47,250
this feature often the way okay Gabe we

502
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,470
are now out of time okay

503
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:50,940
I would like to say one thing because I

504
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,860
failed to say I made well please tell me

505
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,210
I'm also the president of the

506
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,950
information system security Association

507
00:21:55,950 --> 00:22:00,420
here in the UK I've been doing that for

508
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:06,150
the last six anyhow I mean I've been the

509
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,680
president for the last five years or so

510
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,140
I'm finishing on 20 term next year I

511
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,180
hope moving on to give myself space to

512
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,770
probably hopefully do a bit more

513
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:15,300
speaking getting up there instead of

514
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,370
reading a lot of cats to run a bunch of

515
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:19,740
events if anyone is london-based or

516
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,630
uk-based in his London next week my

517
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:24,030
closing event of the year is on the 12th

518
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:27,360
and the evening in Finsbury square just

519
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,490
realised to say UK Christmas or

520
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:30,450
something because I don't have the URL

521
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,060
in front of me because it in Perth but

522
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,920
I'll tweet it out I never said crap on

523
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,110
but yeah by all means something out for

524
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:39,210

525
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:42,390

526
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:42,810
