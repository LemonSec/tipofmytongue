28
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,780
you give us a little bit of a flavour

29
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,520
for some of the work that you do the

30
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,790
kind of things that you did yeah I mean

31
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:30,680
I guess a lot of the time really

32
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,990
understand the physical penetration

33
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:34,640
specialist which for this time in the

34
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,790
morning is always you know something

35
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,189
people smile at but socially and the

36
00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:41,810
psychological surgeries between

37
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,140
specialties not on it for ever feel

38
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,470
really old now especially the many hats

39
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,520
meetups and things that I see the guys

40
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,740
that you know feel ancient

41
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:54,380
yeah mostly so not a technical hacker

42
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,080
but unless you see the brain as a

43
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,590
technical tool or an affiliate and if

44
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:03,590
you do then that's what I would do and

45
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,030
yeah and a lot of kind of just breaking

46
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,790
into buildings and stuff I guess I've

47
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,220
been doing that before I really even

48
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,310
woulda labeled it anything to do with

49
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:15,050
cyber or hockey and also

50
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,570
Engineering just almost own it really

51
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,510
fall off a lot of roots and things and

52
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,630
then of course within the community put

53
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,460
besides that feel first these sides on

54
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,380
the share got another one coming next

55
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,590
year are they adding podcasts and things

56
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,060
and China and a few people with stories

57
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,200
because communities full of people of

58
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,900
great stories so I like to put them on

59
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,750
and then talk about them as well so you

60
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,270
wrote a podcast and you do videos and

61
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,860
things like that yeah tell us about that

62
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,440
yes I have the human factor podcast and

63
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,960
I mean a lot of people you know what am

64
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,610
I was surprised and overwhelmed by is

65
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,260
the generosity of people it's like this

66
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,360
you know yes people to come on and they

67
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,420
come on and they just open up and then

68
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,980
talk about what they do what they're

69
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,350
passionate about and we got you know a

70
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,180
lot of engagement from the community

71
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,340
because I think you try and not focus on

72
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,680
the product side or anything but just on

73
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,720
what you know why people do what they

74
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,290
love them and and I'm always surprised

75
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:15,230
and delighted about the generosity of

76
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,370
people who give their time to come and

77
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,710
talk about these things they see so many

78
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:21,980
podcasts now and they're I guess it's

79
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,950
just it's just that we all want to share

80
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,270
within the community people want to

81
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,800
share about and talk about it get people

82
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,070
it get people in to the community and

83
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,060
once we've done that we've done little

84
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,530
events like studios and Scotland

85
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:34,730

00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,870

99
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,570
local conference well I want first of

100
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,790
all just a big big shout of Tamar today

101
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,860
to Jamie because obviously he's doing

102
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,108
the technical side of this for this

103
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:19,640
conference and he came and he helped Al

104
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,140
Kooper and everything at Liverpool as

105
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:24,169
well so yeah like I fight about but well

106
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:25,490
it was just we felt like we needed

107
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,740
something in Liverpool you know we get

108
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,460
it there's lots of

109
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,190
great besides in and around you know

110
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,300
obviously Manchester's been going for a

111
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,350
couple of years and everything it's not

112
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:36,139
too far but we just feel like Liverpool

113
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:38,330
such a good city to do it and we

114
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,729
obviously like a party we've got the van

115
00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:44,780
news and it was chaotic you know me and

116
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,979
I think you've got to chew on legs

117
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:47,900
sister Coulson yeah

118
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:52,580
I'm Brian and Mike ample and rich rich

119
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:56,810
severe helped and God it seems like such

120
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:57,830
a good idea

121
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,620
we've got a few years to do it yeah and

122
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,509
it's a lot of work you know it's so much

123
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:05,090
work to get it to run smoothly but live

124
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,430
fills the city that likes party and we

125
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,889
like to welcome people and you know we

126
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:12,289
were overwhelmed by the success of it by

127
00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:14,479
the heat it was so hot we actually had

128
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,889
it in the Maritime Museum and Liverpool

129
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:18,110
on the Albert Dock on a day that was one

130
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,580
of the hottest days I think it's the

131
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,550
hottest day of this year and one of the

132
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,449
hottest days ever

133
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:26,240
and it was sweltering hot and you know

134
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,220
but we wanted to hold it in an iconic

135
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,530
building so we wanted to hold it on the

136
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,360
dock somewhere where people could easily

137
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,699
find and I suppose one the best things

138
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:36,199
about it was the directions I gave on

139
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:38,150
Twitter on the day was if he just goes

140
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,830
towards the great big green baize on top

141
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,990
of the builds and your sailors which was

142
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,880
quite cool you know like how do we get

143
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,500
there just find the live adage you know

144
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,800
yeah and it was kind of we had some

145
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,830
great speakers it was it was just such a

146
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:55,219
lovely comment together of everyone and

147
00:05:55,219 --> 00:05:56,630
everything that we wanted in the

148
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,949
community and we're hoping to do again

149
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:01,250
next year and China fine today's is the

150
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,960
problem because there's quite a lot of

151
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,520
events now me do I want to clash with

152
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,690
anything because we want to go to them

153
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,849
so we were thinking of one degree and it

154
00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:10,250
was gonna clash with steel calm I'm like

155
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,199
no no no we all want to go into steel

156
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:14,810
calm yes now we're still nailing a date

157
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,919
but um yeah it's it's there Liverpool is

158
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:20,300
just one of those cities I think we were

159
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,500
really lucky with some of the speakers

160
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,199
because Liverpool's one of the city's

161
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:25,699
people want to visit you know for other

162
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:26,419
reasons

163
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:29,030
mm-hm and yeah we are doing you know I

164
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,650
was saying have to be if I'm sorry and

165
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,229
speak here yeah it was just it was a

166
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:35,030
brilliant day and we're gonna keep doing

167
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:36,860
it so I think this I mean I can

168
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,870
exclusively reveal if you like

169
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:43,409
therefore the 2021 we're going to focus

170
00:06:43,409 --> 00:06:46,199
on the social engineering the physical

171
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:50,009
the OPSEC sides as well as obviously all

172
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:51,029
the usual things that could Zappala

173
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:53,520
b-sides and try and give some classes

174
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,529
and things on things like sweeten rooms

175
00:06:55,529 --> 00:06:58,589
and self-defense and breaking

176
00:06:58,589 --> 00:07:00,210
surveillance and those types of things

177
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,789
so it should be quite a spooky even

178
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:05,039
basic honors besides that sounds

179
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:05,520
excellent

180
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,039
sounds fantastic a weird a good time man

181
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:09,719
I've got an affinity for Liverpool

182
00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:11,099
anyway from my time in the music

183
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:13,050
industry so it's which I've made no

184
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,539
secret of it mm-hmm - actually rock up

185
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:18,059
in Liverpool on a sec engagement as it

186
00:07:18,059 --> 00:07:20,729
were was was extra special so yeah look

187
00:07:20,729 --> 00:07:23,819
forward to get involved next year but

188
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:28,969
brilliant Stewart so you're good yeah

189
00:07:28,969 --> 00:07:31,789
it's suddenly a man it is Sunday so

190
00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:34,050
you're are strangers have put in events

191
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,240
on you've done quite a few I think I was

192
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,520
also gross 20 or events in September

193
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,719
time yeah gives a bit your background

194
00:07:42,719 --> 00:07:44,490
give us a flavor for your kind of day of

195
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:48,180
the week yes also a day job with just E

196
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,800
which is some dealing with cloud

197
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,479
security stuff which I've sort morphed

198
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:53,490
into over the last couple years and

199
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,649
still don't know huge amount about I

200
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:58,409
guess and it's just really interesting

201
00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:00,930
and I love the company and I'm having a

202
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,300
really good time the community stuffs

203
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,769
really interesting and I love speaking

204
00:08:04,769 --> 00:08:06,959
to people who all involved in all these

205
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,759
facets of the community stuff because we

206
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,759
do a little thing in Scotland and

207
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:13,050
everyone's on a pretty similar journey I

208
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:15,629
think we're in now you just start a

209
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:16,949
thing where you do a thing and then it

210
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:19,529
grows these legs and you never quite get

211
00:08:19,529 --> 00:08:21,149
it right and it morphs into something

212
00:08:21,149 --> 00:08:22,740
you just didn't really expect it to be

213
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,389
and I suppose although no different

214
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:26,909
started to meet up four or five years

215
00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:30,240
ago whenever it was and it just kind of

216
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,429
grew legs and becoming became quite

217
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:36,299
popular I now run a project with Harry

218
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,399
McLaren I've ended up in Scotland so

219
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,769
it's got and connect and yeah we were

220
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:43,828
two people who ran meetups and we just

221
00:08:43,828 --> 00:08:45,389
saw lots of kind of issues in Scotland

222
00:08:45,389 --> 00:08:47,300
of people doing amazing things and

223
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,110
individually driving lots of cool stuff

224
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,689
but things were clashing it's hard to

225
00:08:51,689 --> 00:08:52,970
get speakers

226
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:55,940
hard to get venues sponsorship and we

227
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,080
sort of came together and thought why

228
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,850
don't we just build something that's all

229
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,350
it's like a conduit between all these

230
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:03,500
groups of people so now we have a whole

231
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,090
stack of moderators who can fulfill

232
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:07,720
different roles within what we're doing

233
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,890
and they help with all manner of things

234
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,900
that we get involved in and a whole raft

235
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,720
of things in Scotland not cuz we're 20

236
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,820
you know it influence any of those kind

237
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,040
of things but just because it is a small

238
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,300
enough community where we all know each

239
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,380
other and can all help you till there

240
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:24,080
yet we're all doing separate stuff but

241
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,550
the thing we do and multiple

242
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,290
organizations and it's been really

243
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:33,080
really valuable I'm really proud of it

244
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,600
actually we were a year in there isn't a

245
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,340
strategy there's no longer term plan

246
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:40,010
we're just trying to do something yeah

247
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:43,460
cool bloody fine job you do as well just

248
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:47,930
give us an idea cuz that we see on

249
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,840
social media all that kind of stuff that

250
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,800
there could be some challenges around

251
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,380
putting events on it's fair to say and I

252
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,940
think where I'm going with this is that

253
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,920
you're never gonna please everybody and

254
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,810
you're always going to have people that

255
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:02,060
find that it's not with them or their

256
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,550
their thing because it were has been

257
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:07,910
overlooked or neglected yeah what I

258
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,590
guess this is to the pair of you really

259
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,450
is what your experiences of that and how

260
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:13,040
do you have you kind of overcome some of

261
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,110
those challenges in terms of making

262
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:17,080
these events as inclusive as you can

263
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:21,830
yeah chip in before Jenny yeah so again

264
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,780
when we started the meetup in Scotland

265
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,430
and then the cyber Scotland connect

266
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:27,170
thing you know it's born out of some

267
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:30,890
ideas to help people be part of a

268
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:33,500
community and talk about things and then

269
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,880
as it does get bigger you do have to

270
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,960
think about things that you didn't think

271
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,970
about before so things like code of

272
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,970
conduct and as you become a bit more of

273
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:44,810
a formal thing those things so and we've

274
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:45,830
been on a bit of a learning curve with

275
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:48,710
that anybody has Scotland's an

276
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,450
interesting place because unfortunately

277
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,580
not the most diverse of populations

278
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,350
compared to other parts of over the UK

279
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:57,440
or beyond and we're all trying to make

280
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,390
that better and I suppose the only thing

281
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:02,480
with out is we're trying to do what we

282
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,050
think is

283
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:05,210
thing with a whole selection of people

284
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:07,700
who couldn't you can help and we don't

285
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,710
always get it right we're not trying to

286
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,060
overthink it too much

287
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,010
the events that we run up in Scotland

288
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,960
are awesome we don't get any

289
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,790
particularly dissenting voices which is

290
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:23,300
great and speakers and crowds but yeah

291
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,790
I'm sure it's Jenny any thoughts yeah I

292
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:28,310
mean I agree that we a silly for

293
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:30,680
Liverpool it was you know we had such a

294
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,750
small team and we doing everything I

295
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:36,140
mean Maternity so much of it right but

296
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:39,620
then what you know what right in terms

297
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,500
of the actual event and when people you

298
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,480
know that's because you know pull out

299
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,000
and sort of pull things together and

300
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,500
then on the day there's just so many

301
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,720
moving parts to try and we'll have to

302
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,490
say there were people they you know who

303
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:56,030
needed extra help in terms of physical

304
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,610
capabilities around the venue there were

305
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,980
people who were you know some really

306
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,960
overwhelmed by the fact because it was a

307
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,910
really kind of it was a really fun event

308
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:08,180
was very loud and very chaotic you know

309
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,160
and people were there to have a really

310
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,750
good time as well sort of really enjoyed

311
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,360
the talks never think and so there's a

312
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,190
lot of moving parts and I think the

313
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:18,170
thing that we've sort of really bear in

314
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:21,110
mind for next year is you wanted to kind

315
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,790
of be informal and loose because it was

316
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:25,670
a b-sides but at the same time got to

317
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,260
keep pulling in you've got to keep

318
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,860
advising and you know the way things are

319
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,230
running the way people behave in you

320
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,270
know we had a great team on in terms of

321
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,500
it we had to be either the goon squad

322
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,200
and I wanted to be called that by the

323
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,080
way and I mean you did so you can call

324
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,010
yourself whatever you like that would

325
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,480
get my fiber guichen you want to think

326
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,280
about the things I think we should just

327
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,630
pull an everyone together and laughing

328
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,700
so I mean I think the thing that I've

329
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:53,240
whelmed me was the will of everyone he

330
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,280
was there to make it way from the

331
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,710
support that we got yeah I am and the

332
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,870
enthusiasm of it and you know on the day

333
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,490
it's a full day event yeah I was there

334
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,890
from sort of half 7:00 in the morning he

335
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:05,030
told me enough the night before but

336
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:08,000
we've days from very early and and it's

337
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,710
the enthusiasm of it let's go but

338
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,390
there's just so many moving parts to an

339
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,940
event and and that's what I'd say people

340
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,870
are starting to put b-sides together

341
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:20,090
one of the things is you want to grow it

342
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,770
you know you want it to be huge I was

343
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:23,060
thinking our you know next year we'll do

344
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:26,240
two days or three days or and and a

345
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,890
couple of people in the business he's

346
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,200
done lots off there and so people from

347
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,700
besides loads I me has a lot of kind of

348
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,980
big brothers and sisters from over the

349
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,870
world you I spoke to you about besides

350
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:38,750
the fans before Liverpool I am giving me

351
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,130
advice and a piece of advice they gave

352
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:41,600
was don't be too keen to grammar too

353
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,390
quickly you know get that one day as

354
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,250
tight as you can and as right as you can

355
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,310
because it seems counterintuitive but

356
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,920
the more kinds of time you put into

357
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,960
control and what happens the more loose

358
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,000
people can actually be and so we've kind

359
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,410
of learned from that a little bit inside

360
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:58,670
you know we're gonna keep it to a day

361
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,200
obviously we'll be there the afternoon

362
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,970
before and doing a few things but we're

363
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,710
gonna keep it to the day well just

364
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,000
really watch out for those move from

365
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,730
parts of the stand because you get so

366
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,710
caught up in the minutiae in the day

367
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,600
that it's quite difficult sometimes to

368
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,430
see focus and you know some of the

369
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,660
bigger things Sebastian what we're

370
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,070
looking at this year it's laying and as

371
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:20,330
you go as you said and but you know it's

372
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:23,420
more you overwhelmed by the support in

373
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,250
this community for things like this ya

374
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,920
know not you're not just in terms of

375
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,840
people donating and support nurse and

376
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,120
sponsoring and everything but just

377
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,730
goodwill you know just people just

378
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,840
saying you know radio you have a good

379
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,210
one you know don't worry yeah well with

380
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,610
you I mean it's that's something about

381
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,470
this community that I you know I've

382
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,180
worked and I'm still doing from a lot of

383
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,520
different sectors and clients and stuff

384
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,130
but it's something that it overwhelms me

385
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,900
sometimes in the community the way

386
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,390
people will chip in and support people

387
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:56,780
yeah yes funny on my whiteboard behind

388
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:57,890
me I was just going massively as

389
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:00,650
positive which is what I get across it

390
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,080
in telling this morning and like you

391
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,150
know you get the odd kind of dissenting

392
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,070
voice either on Twitter or something

393
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:10,220
happen at an event that whatever it

394
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,320
might be but yeah I totally agree Jenny

395
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,810
it's just things like this and just the

396
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:15,950
way that everybody gives back to a

397
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:18,230
community I think is phenomenal I can't

398
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:20,120
can't really finger too many industries

399
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,250
that this amount of people commit their

400
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,540
own time

401
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,770
for for not a huge amount of reward

402
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,750
because we know this is a personal time

403
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,010
we're doing a lot of these things in so

404
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,720
it's not to get that small eye lens out

405
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,160
but but that is fundamentally what we

406
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,230
all do contribute to because we care

407
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,640
about it so much I think you're right

408
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,529
and I think speaking from point of view

409
00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:39,000
as somebody who's been a punter a

410
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,080
conference or or tent and also been a

411
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,490
speaker at a number of companies

412
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,800
particularly this year you become

413
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,230
invested in it you know even though

414
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,040
you're not part of the organizing

415
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,230
committee or your in organizing on the

416
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:55,170
day you invest in it so you invest in it

417
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,300
by turning up at it or you invest in it

418
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,880
by preparing its or or it or any of

419
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,770
those kinds of things and I think when

420
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,180
it comes to the day of the event you

421
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,920
just kind of along with everybody else

422
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,510
you're willing it to succeed

423
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:09,959
yeah I mean I you know I speak I mean

424
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:12,000
more than half the time I'm speaking now

425
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,560
that all sorts of conferences all over

426
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,470
the place and so you know you can have

427
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,570
under the impression I've done this you

428
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:21,270
know this is not my first rodeo I mean

429
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,279
this year probably done I think things

430
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,339
about sixty five events this year one

431
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:29,970
thing another as a speaker I am and so

432
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,500
you think I've got this that what could

433
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,970
possibly happen that I don't know but if

434
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,970
it's your event and also we've run it on

435
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:38,070
a shoestring you know the minute that we

436
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,660
have enough sponsorship money we can the

437
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,209
sponsorship you know we don't want to

438
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:43,560
make any money from it we want to just

439
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,200
offer you know try to try and offer some

440
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,200
sort of hardship tickets or seconds for

441
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,060
students or lower price things one try

442
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,830
and make it as accessible as possible

443
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,510
for as many types of people as possible

444
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,430
we didn't want to make any money and

445
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,980
then what you find is that it's so

446
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,270
different from corporate events and

447
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,700
things I speak at where there's just so

448
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,339
much money that like you can almost you

449
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:06,959
know I lay a long time go and corporate

450
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,220
that there's a lot of problems if you've

451
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,819
got the resources that you just solve it

452
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,589
if you can throw money and resources and

453
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:16,079
tie my problems and tees they go away

454
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,670
but if you've decided that you're not

455
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,079
going to make any money the whole things

456
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,390
in the spirit of community and then

457
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,949
you've got to be creative and think of

458
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:25,880
creative solutions to get over things

459
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,319
and I think you know you couldn't be in

460
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,360
a better community for getting people to

461
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,100
think outside the box would be creative

462
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,320
you know as a research sort of send

463
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,910
flags are from various things in you

464
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:36,350
know

465
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:39,500
people are just fun so yeah no I mean

466
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,730
I'll come to the end of the year I'm

467
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:41,840
just feeling a lot of love for the

468
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,750
community despite everything that goes

469
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,779
on you know I think we forget sometimes

470
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:50,149
that you know we're quite tight-knit I

471
00:17:50,149 --> 00:17:51,980
mean I did a talk a while ago I was

472
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,230
talking about the numbers of people in

473
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:56,750
the emphasize of the UK and the figure

474
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,009
that was sort of coming up was only

475
00:17:58,009 --> 00:18:00,409
around our three hundred thousand yeah

476
00:18:00,409 --> 00:18:02,509
right and so you think about that and

477
00:18:02,509 --> 00:18:04,190
that's actually that's not that many

478
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,899
people it's no wonder that we all know

479
00:18:05,899 --> 00:18:07,789
each other and it feels like a family

480
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:10,159
with everything that that implies you

481
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:12,740
know with the kind of and I'm going to

482
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,940
say this though and probably sure but

483
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,080
like you've got like the pissed on

484
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,639
callin antsy over in Mon : with the

485
00:18:16,639 --> 00:18:18,169
course trouble at every bed you've got

486
00:18:18,169 --> 00:18:21,019
the you know the people who it's like

487
00:18:21,019 --> 00:18:22,610
being in a pub someone said to me this

488
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:23,870
is what twisters like in four sectors

489
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,730
it's like being in a pub with everyone

490
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,710
and it makes people kept fired and then

491
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,360
the side conversations and then now and

492
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,470
again there's like a squabble or

493
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:32,029
whatever and it feels like that

494
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:33,740
sometimes you know like a family wedding

495
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,299
kind of thing right it's like a family

496
00:18:35,299 --> 00:18:37,820
wedding but the game's on 24/7 across

497
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,679
the globe with all of us involved in the

498
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,710
pinyons and there yeah and I just well

499
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:45,019
you know but for the most part family

500
00:18:45,019 --> 00:18:47,450
weapons for fun right so that's that's

501
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,100
really where I came from with it and

502
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,350
then just can't wait to get it all going

503
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,299
again unless you can I've been to seduce

504
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,889
events and Scotland's and it's the same

505
00:18:54,889 --> 00:18:57,409
in Scotland's the same in liege it's the

506
00:18:57,409 --> 00:19:00,139
same for all the b-sides effects and and

507
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,690
as a saint just for the community we get

508
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:04,159
on with it and most people have got the

509
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:06,470
best intentions most of the time that's

510
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,909
a safe we need to create a problem

511
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:09,830
solver and I mean if we look at you guys

512
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:12,470
today when I saw that the a the Google

513
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,720
thing went down Ford Escort you know

514
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,980
there was a little bit of you know

515
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,570
this has gone down for it for being on

516
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:21,529
one yeah I had no worry at all that you

517
00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:22,909
guys are gonna put no known and come up

518
00:19:22,909 --> 00:19:25,700
with a plan B and a massive respect for

519
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,950
you to do it the way you did because

520
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,929
because you know we make things happen

521
00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:32,509
yes that yeah I think you're right and

522
00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:34,970
people pull together it's this well I

523
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:36,559
would call it the British spirit but

524
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:37,850
it's not about that it's about everybody

525
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:40,129
that that's we're all ultimately on the

526
00:19:40,129 --> 00:19:42,019
same team and it's things like back on

527
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:43,399
one things like

528
00:19:43,399 --> 00:19:45,799
b-sides and cyber Scotland connect where

529
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:47,480
you see it manifests where people

530
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,110
actually do pull together because

531
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,330
the care they give a and that

532
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,130
everybody wants goes back to my point

533
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:54,690
about investment everybody wants her in

534
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:57,929
a good outcome for things like this and

535
00:19:57,929 --> 00:19:59,970
that's clear and I think the other thing

536
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,710
it demonstrates is never underestimate

537
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,990
the amount of effort that goes in behind

538
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:06,440
the scenes in making these about success

539
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,920
mmm you know and having not really there

540
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,630
come one because we can't through it

541
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,220
together on the back of a packet but

542
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,490
certainly like when you've got to get a

543
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,590
venue and you've got to get catering

544
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,120
you've got to get people in and all this

545
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,490
kind of stuff it's not an easy thing to

546
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,679
do and having seen the wiring on the

547
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:26,970
wall of that on a number of occasions

548
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:29,790
now it's something that I on behalf of

549
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:32,010
the industry generally really appreciate

550
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:36,600
so thank you for your time thank you for

551

you they're interviewing people getting

568
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,750
the right questions managing it all is

569
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,150

575
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,309
donation cuz people aren't doing it for

576
00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:36,690
nothing they're doing it for charity so

577
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:37,260

578
