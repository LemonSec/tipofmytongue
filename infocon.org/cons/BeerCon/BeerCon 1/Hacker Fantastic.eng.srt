1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,510
okay great thank you Matt hacker

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:08,610
fantastic I'm Matt we're truly chuffed

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,679
to bits to have you on onboard

4
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:13,620
welcome to Viacom well thank you I've

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,389
never taken part in a virtual conference

6
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:17,699
before so it's certainly an interesting

7
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:19,830
I've been tuning in an hour all weekend

8
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:25,140
while working on some iOS related it's

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,970
been very interesting to to get so many

10
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,859
different people's opinions and hear

11
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:30,000
about what people are doing the industry

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,769
it's really it's really bright quite

13
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:34,410
exciting really to hear everyone's views

14
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,120
and for some different things that

15
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,850
certainly picked up a few things myself

16
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:41,550
around OSINT and various others so yes

17
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:42,450
been there it's been good so I'm

18
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,730
definitely you know grateful to have the

19
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,469
opportunity to come on and speak to

20
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:49,950
everyone and so this is a mental health

21
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,890
and PFF as well right that's right yeah

22
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,129
donations are going towards them you

23
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:58,020
know we're very pleased about that

24
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,559
because I think those are two important

25
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:05,269
charities for all of us in the business

26
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:08,100
I think that the mental health one

27
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,070
especially and I think that not enough

28
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,520
people speak about you know some of the

29
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,130
their experiences you know with

30
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,830
consulting and the kind of workload that

31
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,310
you get you know it can lead to kind of

32
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,470
depression and various other things if

33
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,750
you're you know constantly travelling

34
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,369
around constantly on site you know

35
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:32,640
working ridiculous hours you know you

36
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,290
people are do experience kind of burnout

37
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:35,820
stuff and it does happen a lot more

38
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,400
frequently than people realize and I

39
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,630
think that it's good you know the

40
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,220
information security community is at

41
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,320
least acknowledging that now and you

42
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,479
know doing more for it but so you know

43
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,369
it's one of those things really I think

44
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:49,710
depression is a big killer on young men

45
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,220
especially and you know not enough of us

46
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,619
seek you know guidance and help and

47
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:57,180
those things impact us so it's really

48
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,350
great to be able to be involved with

49
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,270
something and you know it's raising

50
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,520
money for those kinds of issues awesome

51
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,799
to have you here Matt yeah it's a real

52
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,840
honor so yeah I won't what's really

53
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,160
grateful to you for sharing your time

54
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,760
with us so just to just kick us off I

55
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,390
guess

56
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,610
what do you mind I mean I think a lot of

57
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,170
people know who you are and you're very

58
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,670
active and you're a very busy guy and

59
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,680
your company's very busy would you mind

60
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,790
just giving us a little bit of an

61
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,340
insight into who you are and what it is

62
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,160
that you guys do yeah so I manage

63
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,170
Matthew and I go by the nom de Jour

64
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,280
hacker fantastic

65
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,890
I've been doing penetration testing and

66
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,690
ethical hacking and vulnerability

67
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,600
discovery for around 20 years or so I'd

68
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,110
say now most of that time has been in

69
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,810
industry working for clients under

70
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,270
contracts and writing things and the

71
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,400
co-founder a hacker house we were a

72
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,459
training company and that provides pen

73
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,290
testing services I'm actually just kind

74
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,700
of between flights moment I've got some

75
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,280
clients to go see later on today and we

76
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,670
basically you know hack things to try

77
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,290
and find vulnerabilities and often our

78
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,760
clients you know they're already doing

79
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,260
pen tests they're already kind of

80
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,239
security aware and they're looking for

81
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,040
people to kind of come in and try and

82
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,320
get give them a handle on you know

83
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,000
finding new vulnerabilities much like

84
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,190
the last speaker was just saying working

85
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,750
with the developers trying to improve

86
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,970
their tooling showing them how the under

87
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,730
abilities manifest so they can be better

88
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,670
you know more aware of it as part of

89
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,470
that we started doing you know a lot of

90
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,630
training a lot of entry level training

91
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,299
because what we kind of realized is that

92
00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:32,250
the information security industry is a

93
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,480
little bit like a pyramid of knowledge

94
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,040
and it's a very top of that pyramid of

95
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,480
knowledge you know there's a you know

96
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,910
keep overflows you staff the freeze-out

97
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,260
of boundaries you know all of this

98
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,049
exploitation low-level engineering kind

99
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:46,410
of hacking and but that is actually such

100
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:49,980
a small part of what industry means in

101
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,750
terms of security most industry doesn't

102
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,760
need you to come in and write a zero-day

103
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,040
exploit for their kernel to demonstrate

104
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,560
certain kind of thing much like if you

105
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,760
look at Apple and you look at the

106
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,930
technology right you know a lot of the

107
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,340
jailbreaking done is done in a

108
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,130
production environment you know but the

109
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,160
internally apple you know they have

110
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,660
their own access to the technology that

111
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,459
they're building so you know they're

112
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,530
able to investigate security controls a

113
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,819
lot more

114
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:17,310
more thoroughly but what we found is

115
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,350
that the the fundamentals the basic

116
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,509
building blocks of cybersecurity the

117
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:24,690
abilities do pentesting build reviews

118
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,210
understand why patches are being applied

119
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,710
what the you know a sequel injection

120
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,990
attack looks like what that means to a

121
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,580
company a lot a lot of those

122
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,039
fundamentals appear to be missing you

123
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:36,750
know and we have in information security

124
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,020
and a group of people really technical

125
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,750
really smart really knowledgeable but

126
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,460
the the translation the ability to

127
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,710
communicate what those people can do and

128
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,270
what they can offer to a business is

129
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,160
kind of void you know there's a there's

130
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,199
a big disconnect between earth and the

131
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:54,150
engineering team the development team

132
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,759
and general tech Teamsters understanding

133
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,770
what is computer hacking and why the

134
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,120
hell should we have it in our business

135
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,160
and why do we need hackers working for

136
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,979
us you know so I think being able to do

137
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:06,630
some of that has been you know pretty

138
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,729
integral to my own journey and because

139
00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:10,440
I'd realized that you know there's

140
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,050
there's a lot that we can offer people

141
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,580
you know that doesn't necessarily come

142
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,070
in the in the form of a zero game LX

143
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,690
well those are great and they're fun and

144
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,550
everyone needs them you know they're not

145
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,560
necessarily the thing that organizations

146
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,150
need a lot of those organizations need

147
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,500
understanding like how do we use that

148
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,849
what is that

149
00:05:26,849 --> 00:05:28,169
you know how do how do I as a developer

150
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:31,229
make use of you know forms poisoning

151
00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:33,479
attacks to validate you know what's

152
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:36,419
going on in my environment so we do a

153
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:37,860
lot of that we need a lot of lot of

154
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,840
knowledge transfer you know I like

155
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,060
working with clients helping them

156
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,080
understand you know build up their

157
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,840
internal kind of pentest teams so that

158
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,830
when they're calling us in you know

159
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:49,830
we're going in to see them for you know

160
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,419
more interesting things like kernel

161
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:53,010
level attacks or things that are a

162
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,479
little bit outside the scope of someone

163
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,729
you know who's done some some security

164
00:05:56,729 --> 00:05:58,830
training and but you know it's a big

165
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,930
part of them what we're about you know

166
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:01,800
trying to get people more

167
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,900
self-sufficient in security because you

168
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,909
know when I started doing this it was a

169
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:07,169
very complicated thing you had to

170
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:09,270
download a lot of stuff a lot of work

171
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,680
you had to learn C you had to learn

172
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,449
assembler there wasn't ways around it

173
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:14,909
now today you know a lot of the tools

174
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:16,470
that are out there you know you don't

175
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,990
necessarily mean someone who has you

176
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,789
know the greatest technical proficiency

177
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:23,490
in a low-level language to be able to

178
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:24,610
interpret vulnerable

179
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,590
the assessment right you know that's not

180
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:30,370
that's not conducive really to it - to

181
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,590
the - to good business what was good for

182
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,710
business is being able to understand

183
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,969
where the security risks are and how to

184
00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:38,379
address them right now so that's all

185
00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:39,550
they really care about they don't care

186
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,560
how clever you were in doing you attack

187
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,909
they just care that the attacks don't

188
00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:44,199
impact their business and their bottom

189
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:46,960
line and so we found that there was a

190
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,460
there was a big need for fundamental

191
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:51,400
framing a big need to increase awareness

192
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,270
of tools technology but also empowerment

193
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,159
you know I changed my life by using

194
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,509
computer hacking and there's a lot of

195
00:06:58,509 --> 00:06:59,469
other people there's a lot of those

196
00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:02,439
worries about so far in this industry -

197
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:04,300
to speak with people who have come from

198
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,509
you know different backgrounds and you

199
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:09,580
know have made money or I've got jobs

200
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,650
and you have done good things with their

201
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,629
lives and a lot of that is down

202
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:15,250
something we were handing them and the

203
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,469
way that they've applied it so we're big

204
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:18,819
big believers in that you know that

205
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:21,039
these kinds of skills and they're

206
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,629
empowering because they allow people to

207
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:24,490
kinda taint change their current

208
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,289
situation you know if you if you if

209
00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:27,849
you're looking at your job on a Monday

210
00:07:27,849 --> 00:07:29,589
morning you think I really want to do

211
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:31,839
that job anymore you know there are so

212
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:36,069
many jobs in cybersecurity the URI it's

213
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:38,349
a really good angle for people to to

214
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:40,560
kind of pivot from a technical role and

215
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,909
indeed you know the industry is always

216
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:44,500
looking for new ways to welcome people

217
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,259
and so that's it's a real big part of

218
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:49,659
them you know what I'm about the other

219
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:51,310
elements of it of course is hardware

220
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:56,949
hacking and hacking the awesome so 2019

221
00:07:56,949 --> 00:07:59,589
found you at the center of what I would

222
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:02,639
call a political mudslinging controversy

223
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,310
and I think you rose to the occasion

224
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:10,150
with the poise and in fact but I did

225
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,650
detect a certain level of frustration

226
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,969
with the way the media ended up

227
00:08:14,969 --> 00:08:17,800
characterizing I'd like you to kind of

228
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,129
set the record straight on what you feel

229
00:08:20,129 --> 00:08:23,020
happened and kind of like how the

230
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,469
security community I think I hope

231
00:08:25,469 --> 00:08:29,909
rallied behind you I didn't you know the

232
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:33,640
the media unfortunately is if dividing

233
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,530
that's a different beat

234
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:37,500
and the intersect the technology B was

235
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,479
some of our staunchest supporters they

236
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:41,520
didn't write anything on tour for those

237
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,710
who are listening and don't know there

238
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,680
was some allegations with my business

239
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,320
partner that were found to be completely

240
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,810
untrue you know they were they work well

241
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:53,370
but they were placed in the media and

242
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:56,340
tabloids and it resulted in a negative

243
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,860
publicity for us so that kind of media

244
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,810
storm was very difficult to manage and

245
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:01,920
we had a lot of members of the public

246
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,870
contacting us got a lot of you know not

247
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,700
very nice thing instead over towards me

248
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,980
and my business part I was also my wife

249
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,370
just for the record okay yeah so you

250
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:17,580
know very very difficult you know time

251
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,950
for us both but in terms of the you know

252
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,620
the community element of it you know

253
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,990
aside from you know journalists not

254
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,390
really covering it on their beat and you

255
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,890
know for us it was interesting to see

256
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:31,890
how the media will just take and write

257
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:34,470
anything you know yeah I really speak

258
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:37,110
for my business partner but a lot of the

259
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,580
stuff that was written was you know

260
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:42,210
completely untrue no we have a

261
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:45,510
two-year-old daughter and you know they

262
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:48,750
were they were it was hard to have to

263
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,620
deal with members of the public

264
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,290
commenting on on my personal life you

265
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:55,290
know especially as people in cyber you

266
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,089
know but these things unfortunately they

267
00:09:57,089 --> 00:09:58,500
you know they do happen I think they

268
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,450
could happen to any of us you know when

269
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,550
when we started harrelson you know

270
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:05,100
generals like you know you as the CEO

271
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,920
you know she retained a high percentage

272
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,530
of all the company it was really quite

273
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:12,750
quite new for me to have a you know

274
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,910
female CEO and I really did believe in

275
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,780
all of that and I felt that it was very

276
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,130
unfortunate that the you know the

277
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,260
femininity was being what was being used

278
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,390
against her and you know to be honest it

279
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,400
makes you sort of feel a little bit sick

280
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,520
that people can do that really well I

281
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,380
know there was there's a lot of strong

282
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,360
feelings and support for you and your

283
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,820
work and I just wanted to give you the

284
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,770
opportunity tell your side of the story

285
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,950
because I don't think it was covered

286
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:44,190
appropriately and balanced hey Wow sorry

287
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:45,750
man I'll just I'm just chipping a little

288
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,240
bit

289
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,829
nobody wants to be used as a political

290
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:51,339
football right and I can't imagine that

291
00:10:51,339 --> 00:10:54,100
happening to me so I can only begin to

292
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,839
understand possibly how that affected

293
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,139
you and your family but that's the

294
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:02,399
[ __ ] UK right and that's politics

295
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,319
yeah I think it gave me a lot of insight

296
00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:06,550
I mean I had a lot of these companies

297
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:09,160
and for me you know I do a lot of

298
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,079
cybersecurity stuff you know breaking

299
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:12,730
into a media company and changing the

300
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,110
story wouldn't be a difficult thing to

301
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:21,339
me to do you know sitting there ya know

302
00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:25,179
there are people who were you know

303
00:11:25,179 --> 00:11:27,790
throughout all I was just sitting on my

304
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,800
hands like if I do anything it's gonna

305
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,809
backfire so you know we had two very

306
00:11:31,809 --> 00:11:33,850
dignified about this thing with small

307
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:36,429
business owners and you know but it was

308
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:37,839
cleared up and it was just it was just

309
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,420
unfortunate really that the press

310
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,209
decided to run with this table and you

311
00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:45,459
know as I say it shared a negative light

312
00:11:45,459 --> 00:11:47,110
on the you know the hard work that we

313
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:47,559
have done

314
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:52,089
yeah I've seen news story we've been

315
00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:53,589
quite quoted and you know dozens of

316
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:55,689
others and relations day but you know

317
00:11:55,689 --> 00:11:57,040
what they say map because you're a

318
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,309
northern guy I guess yeah in fact just

319
00:12:00,309 --> 00:12:02,350
before I tell you about what they say

320
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:06,119
we met at b-sides Manchester in 2017

321
00:12:06,119 --> 00:12:08,889
really yeah we were you were there with

322
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:12,369
Germany and you kid and we were

323
00:12:12,369 --> 00:12:14,230
introduced by Anthony Kem where the

324
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,209
who's and then I suspect you may

325
00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:19,629
recognize yeah and so we met but I

326
00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:20,889
thought at the time

327
00:12:20,889 --> 00:12:23,529
what's a Northern bloke doing over in

328
00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:26,049
the US and all that kind of stuff

329
00:12:26,049 --> 00:12:27,819
you've got your reasons for that and

330
00:12:27,819 --> 00:12:28,959
that's not the question the question is

331
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,329
what markets do you get in here in terms

332
00:12:31,329 --> 00:12:35,619
you the business that you do are you in

333
00:12:35,619 --> 00:12:37,779
everything amazingly we don't really

334
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:39,339
target specific sectors and industries

335
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:41,709
and we go where there's a need for the

336
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:43,269
work so a lot of our clients are

337
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:44,860
actually based up in the Bay Area we

338
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,720
have a lot of clients obviously without

339
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,860
naming names to develop and privacy and

340
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,129
communication solutions for which we in

341
00:12:54,129 --> 00:12:55,839
fact on where I'm off to later on this

342
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,380
afternoon to where we basically

343
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,800
you know FERS analyzed trying to inject

344
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,600
you know attacks and they you know

345
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,460
they'll handle the communications

346
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,800
traffic and data of you know few million

347
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,220
people on average a day you know so the

348
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,630
work that we do does have a direct

349
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,370
impact and I you know it does help

350
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,770
protect people you know and that's

351
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,210
that's a key thing for me really I

352
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,560
really I don't I don't particularly

353
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,460
enjoy you know causing work for works

354
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,080
sake you know sitting in a data center

355
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,730
somewhere and just running you know

356
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,140
tools and scans and much prefer working

357
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,050
with an organization that's trying to

358
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,970
get handle a cybersecurity you know and

359
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:36,370
understand the guts of it and a lot of

360
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:37,870
my clients were actually reacted what's

361
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:40,660
happened to them is you know somebody

362
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,540
wrote an advisory publish get on daily

363
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,300
Dave or full disclosure about one of

364
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,640
their competitors obviously that has a

365
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,620
massive impact on their that competitors

366
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,090
market share because it looks like the

367
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,710
competitors being hacked and all the

368
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,990
rest of it so they they're trying to

369
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,790
stay ahead of the competition they're

370
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,950
trying to get their o days found and

371
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:02,800
fixed before somebody else finds them so

372
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,300
they don't think I've heard about no

373
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:09,400
internet so so one thing I wanted to us

374
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,070
it's kind of related in some aspects you

375
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:14,170
what you know was raising but when we

376
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:16,300
mentioned hacking the media just goes

377
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,210
negative doing bad things how do we

378
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,740
change their perception because I mean

379
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,230
one of the things I saw was a journalist

380
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:26,320
saw you were hacking voting machines and

381
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,150
said oh look what this guy is doing he's

382
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:30,010
immediately bad how do we change that

383
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:32,260
perception I think that that's a very

384
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,540
hard fight to do I've been trying to do

385
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,610
that for a while like you know creating

386
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,470
the nom du jour hacker fantastic was a

387
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:41,350
way to spread positive messages to

388
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:44,380
people to try and put a window really

389
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,030
into this world and show people that

390
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,700
it's not dark and mysterious and you

391
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,320
know we're not bad people were just

392
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,320
people that that know how to identify

393
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,250
computers being broken I mean they were

394
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,620
already broken when we received them you

395
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,440
know you're doing how broke and they are

396
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,960
you know so to spread that message into

397
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,720
just achieve that requires a lot of you

398
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,350
know championing of skills a lot of

399
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,250
conversations which we're not good at as

400
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,240
an industry we're not good

401
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,160
having conversations with you know

402
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,649
politicians etc and that's actually why

403
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:16,839
my business partner and I ended up in

404
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:18,550
business together because she was doing

405
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,720
that she was having those conversations

406
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,330
she was going she was getting in the

407
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,220
face of politicians and asking them

408
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,310
questions I met mr. Johnson once on his

409
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:30,339
walk around in Richmond as mayor all

410
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:33,040
walk as he was going around the town and

411
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,260
I spoke to him about computer hackers I

412
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,570
knew who were being extradited right you

413
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,920
know that they're facing extradition

414
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,500
they were facing serious penalties for

415
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,290
their computer crimes and you know I

416
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,720
spoke to him and 80 was very little

417
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,300
regard for it right you know but Jen my

418
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,399
partner was able to get these

419
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:53,399
conversations get these in issues going

420
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:56,380
with people who in the past have not

421
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,839
been so susceptible to to talking about

422
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:01,480
them so I think changing you know

423
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,520
computer hacking is a terminology to

424
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,310
move away from that negative connotation

425
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,050
you know requires more people to

426
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,029
understand that you know it's a

427
00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:11,770
beneficial process that we need our

428
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,750
young people understanding the you know

429
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,970
talk talk as a sequel injection on their

430
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:17,860
website because if if they don't then

431
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,510
then that sequel injection might not get

432
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,820
fixed or there might not be any pressure

433
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,040
on these companies to secure our data

434
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,589
and it seems that you know data spills

435
00:16:26,589 --> 00:16:29,350
out much more regularly and we hear from

436
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:31,360
the lawmakers we hear from politicians

437
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,430
but we never hear from hackers we never

438
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,750
hear from the positive sides of the

439
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,910
people who are identified there was a

440
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,950
problem in the first place and we're too

441
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,959
busy locking them up and so until we

442
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,270
change that kind of mentality you know

443
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,730
we really aren't going to be finding a

444
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,680
bit of a battle and I believe in the UK

445
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,350
it's changed a lot more now you can you

446
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,570
can go in and say I'm gonna pull half or

447
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:53,950
somewhere and that's not gonna raise too

448
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:55,980
many eyebrows it's a bit more understood

449
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,450
even the tabloid journalists statement

450
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,190
when that incident happened when the guy

451
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,690
was saying oh you're happy you're a bad

452
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:04,329
person and you know they recognize that

453
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:07,420
ethical hacking is a legitimate pathway

454
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,189
it is a legitimate career it is a

455
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:12,280
legitimate job you know so I think times

456
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,380
are changing but here in the United

457
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,359
States and that's certainly not the case

458
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:18,250
in fact when we've gone to conferences

459
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,990
and set up a stand and Bimmer okay

460
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,329
attack house

461
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:22,890
you know we had people come up to us and

462
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,869
say you guys are the bad guys cause we

463
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:26,970
don't promote that this kind of thing so

464
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:29,610
we still got the very much hackers or

465
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:32,160
credit card thieves hackers are spying

466
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,800
on your email you know that that mindset

467
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,660
is still very much alive in the u.s.

468
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,470
yeah

469
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,210
whereas I believe in Europe that's

470
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:41,250
changing you know people are more aware

471
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,780
of the jobs that coming more aware this

472
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,059
is a good outlet and here in the US

473
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:47,610
people are doing you know cts there's a

474
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,980
lot of pathways I saw numerous adverts

475
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,080
for you know degrees in cyber security

476
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,270
so there's a lot of options here and

477
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,190
however that that's still like that

478
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:58,350
teenage rebellion

479
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,570
you know mindset is still still frowned

480
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:03,210
upon and I think we'd all agree with the

481
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:07,260
with the fact that you know censorship

482
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,380
of awesome and the way that hackers work

483
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,650
is debt is is not conducive to having

484
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,809
good cyber security you need hackers to

485
00:18:15,809 --> 00:18:18,120
be able to explain how they found books

486
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,500
or what that problems are that they're

487
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,480
they're identifying without the fear of

488
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,100
arrest I mean I saw you know a bug

489
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,100
bouncing program that redirected its

490
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,320
traffic to the FBI I mean you know that

491
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,030
was a AT&T I mean it's a fairly large

492
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,220
telecoms provider but you know if you if

493
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,380
you're if you're scanning AT&T servers

494
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,850
and what you believe to be legal and

495
