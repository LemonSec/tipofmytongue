of a moment yeah that's what we call it

5
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,429
I you know it's interesting to start

6
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,500
here in the diversity in our community

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,960
and hearing from really interesting

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,370
people that have been in the industry

9
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,910
for for a while you know it seems like

10
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,370
we've loaded early part of this show

11
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,340
with with industry veterans I'm I'm

12
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,129
looking forward to hearing the

13
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:48,000
perspective of some of the New York

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,020
folks as we as we roll onwards but just

15
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,140
a bit of an update that from Maury he

16
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,760
indicated that there's some power

17
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,600
outages in California so hopefully we'll

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,510
have those dealt with that's Kris Kobach

19
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,549
is one of our guests coming up a little

20
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:10,049
bit later on so hopefully either she

21
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:12,000
just found out how good her EPS

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,229
batteries are or or they restore her

23
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:18,900
power so she'll be on second vandalism

24
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,240
is her handle she'll be on in about I

25
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,960

26
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,590
good I just have a quick bit keeping

27
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,810
current story before we before we get

28
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,130

29
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,869
are you already done yeah no it's a good

30
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:37,500
story

31
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,390
let me tell you because I ran into you

32
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,759
at a corporate event and we just kind of

33
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,630
had a really great chat about info sack

34
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:49,500
and and alcoholism and all of that kind

35
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,960
of stuff and as you know I this year I

36
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,590
kind of worked at really getting sober

37
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,750
and I just want to say Becky it was so

38
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,939
nice to have your support on that

39
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:04,079
journey and really how do I say I'm

40
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,240
super super proud of you man keep it up

41
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,830
and thank you you know doing

42
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:12,340
can festive season is coming and so it's

43
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,750
gonna it's gonna be a bit of challenge

44
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,940
but for those of you who don't know

45
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,430
Becky Becky tell us a little bit about

46
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:22,150
your journey I mean now a CEO of a bank

47
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:26,500
that's amazing you've had that run so

48
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,020
far who didn't have to pay off to get

49
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:34,900
that yeah Wow clearly hard work yeah so

50
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,570
I think for myself it is it has been a

51
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:40,240
long road it's 23 years almost 24 years

52
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,810
in the business and I actually have a

53
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,040
bit of a cold right now so I'll

54
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,230
apologize up front for that I'm on a

55
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:50,680
large degree of sudafed with a tree

56
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,690
twinkling merrily in the background so

57
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,940
I'm either gonna go one of two extremes

58
00:02:54,940 --> 00:03:01,420
asleep really sure I'm not sure at this

59
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,820
stage but yeah so 23 years in the

60
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,520
business I started off as help desk

61
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,420
analyst you know I worked my way up to

62
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,250
business help desk and then ended up

63
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,230
going into the NOC for the company that

64
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:19,269
I was at and that was like 1997 when I

65
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:20,739
went to the NOC and the guy that hired

66
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:22,570
me he said well we're gonna have to put

67
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:26,050
you on the overnight shift and well

68
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:28,690
there's just new guys you know how are

69
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,130
you how are you gonna feel about that

70
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,070
and I just said well how are they gonna

71
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:33,880
feel about it

72
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,510
and I said I got stuck in from there and

73
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,100
then yeah discovered the SANS Institute

74
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,040
and the SANS Institute is really the

75
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,480
folks that put me on the path to

76
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,269
security and before we had social media

77
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:47,980
before we had Twitter before we had you

78
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,300
know everyone coming together like this

79
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,220
podcast you know all this awesome stuff

80
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,709
for me it was the SANS Institute

81
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:55,180
that's where I met other people that

82
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,010
were passionate and just like insanely

83
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,590
crazy about security and they really

84
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:02,470
spoke to me and yeah I got stuck in with

85
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:05,350
those guys for a long time so now you

86
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:08,170
went from very much a technical focus to

87
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:12,640
a managerial focus you know what so that

88
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,640
journey I mean obviously I'm just gonna

89
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,130
speculate here not everything probably

90
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:22,330
went perfectly some of your

91
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,669
learned about sort of now becoming a

92
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:29,710
suit lessons learned man

93
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:32,169
I think lessons learned I you know know

94
00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:34,270
yourself and know what you're willing to

95
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:37,659
put up with and then if you need to make

96
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:39,699
a call like about a job you know staying

97
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:41,379
at a job leaving a job working for

98
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:43,479
someone not working for someone you know

99
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:45,039
make that call for yourself and don't

100
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:47,949
stay somewhere where you're unhappy I've

101
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:49,689
certainly been in that situation more

102
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:52,330
than once and it took me a while to

103
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,889
figure that out you know it took me a

104
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:55,419
while to figure out that number one

105
00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:57,280
there's a ton of jobs out there for

106
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,719
people and security and that's only

107
00:04:58,719 --> 00:05:00,370
gotten better over the last you know

108
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:03,190
decade in particular and then number two

109
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:06,550
that you can do that like you can change

110
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,870
jobs you know and still be nice to

111
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,759
people like you don't want to burn any

112
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,860
bridges in this community you know and

113
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,529
I've learned that I learned that a

114
00:05:14,529 --> 00:05:15,879
little bit the hard way I've certainly

115
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:18,310
burnt a couple of bridges myself and I

116
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,849
regret that but yeah it's important for

117
00:05:21,849 --> 00:05:23,740
us to maintain professionalism in this

118
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,419
business and also at the same time to

119
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:27,190
take care of each other and realize that

120
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,750
you know not everyone has the same

121
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,879
passion that we do but that doesn't

122
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:33,699
decrease from from what they do you know

123
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:36,909
in the business and I think I had to get

124
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:38,680
some age and maturity under the belt

125
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,259
before I came into that realization for

126
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:44,319
myself so that's sort of the natural

127
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,150
question I've got for you then is like

128
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,770
there's folks out there that are looking

129
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:51,009
for advice and counsel and you know sort

130
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:53,560
of I always cringe when I hear the words

131
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,289
I just got my cissp and I'm now going to

132
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,089
tell you exactly how security should

133
00:05:58,089 --> 00:06:01,569
work what's your view on sort of

134
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,159
certification I mean obviously you

135
00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:06,069
promoted sands sands is great I would

136
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:09,819
say though Sands is a bit unaccessible

137
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:11,919
to those that aren't sort of corporately

138
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,050
backed oh it's gotten so expensive

139
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,729
hasn't it yeah I mean and even when I

140
00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:17,319
did actually part of the reason I went

141
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:19,210
to Sands instructor Ruta so I could get

142
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,639
free classes I mean all I got together

143
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:23,349
the very first time I went because my

144
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:25,270
company paid for and even back then I

145
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,370
think it was about 3k I mean we're

146
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:30,069
talking like two thousand two thousand

147
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:32,199
one something like that so yeah I

148
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:34,270
someone hit me up the other day and I

149
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,460
was asking me about it they

150
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,750
I'm looking at this class you know I

151
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,490
know you know sins what do you think you

152
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,960
know the class of 7k I was like oh wow

153
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,570
that's some crazy money so about

154
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,430
certifications or I think certifications

155
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,170
you know are really helpful for a couple

156
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,750
of reasons I think they're great for

157
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,790
helping people to get a sense of

158
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:56,580
confidence about you know different

159
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,950
topics within security and I think when

160
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,270
you're brand new to security it's

161
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,860
important in that it helps people to

162
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,620
learn about this massive spectrum you

163
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,750
know that we have in security because

164
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,730
it's just so much I mean there's just so

165
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,760
much to do and we knew that outside of

166
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,170
looking in I think that's quite

167
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,210
overwhelming and so I think being able

168
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:17,880
to do that helps people a lot can I just

169
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,280
make a quick point about certs

170
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,740
I find it doesn't help when the

171
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,870
organization doesn't define the role of

172
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:30,450
the security person that well so if if

173
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,820
like anybody else you're a little bit of

174
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,680
a jack of all trades and a master of

175
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,660
none and you find yourself in your

176
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,000
company doing security and it can be

177
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,740
anything from building security through

178
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,690
some risk management through to you know

179
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,370
helping out in the stock or whatever I

180
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,470
find it's quite difficult to actually

181
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:50,640
nail an appropriate to go for that

182
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,020
that's just me I found it really

183
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,960
difficult no I agree but also because

184
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,820
the company's not going to be able to

185
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,530
back you I think you know they're not

186
00:07:58,530 --> 00:07:59,610
going to be able to help you pin that

187
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:04,440
down and and if you if you don't have

188
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,210
that support I think it makes it even

189
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,920
more difficult because face it you know

190
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,690
people are always like oh yeah my

191
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,430
company's gonna pay for XYZ and I'm

192
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,810
gonna go pursue this course or whatever

193
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,520
and then the company's not gonna give

194
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,380
you time to study for that I've watched

195
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,510
for one company that ever set aside time

196
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,430
for that and all the rest of the time it

197
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,780
was basically like you know hey we've

198
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:25,500
paid for it good luck with that yeah I

199
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,600
think it is super important to have that

200
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,760
company backing but where you don't I

201
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,680
think it's it's really good for people

202
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,840
to you know make use of this community

203
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,570
and not be afraid to get stuck in for me

204
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,460
I was super afraid to get stuck into the

205
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:42,059
community I you know people may not

206
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:43,559
believe me but I don't take rejection

207
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:46,920
well I don't like confrontation I'm

208
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,800
uber people-pleaser and it just was

209
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,510
super difficult for me to get into

210
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,000
twitter or anything where someone you

211
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,500
know might try and tackle me for having

212
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,600
a view yeah stupid thing to say out loud

213
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,250
no it's not because it's actually

214
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,990
exactly the problem that everybody else

215
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:07,500
has I think yeah yeah well and I'm so

216
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,269
petrified of it I mean I you know I'm

217
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:11,790
I'm 40 plus years old and I'm still

218
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,889
petrified of someone you know basically

219
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:15,720
shouting at me over Twitter which is

220
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,760
really really childish thing to admit

221
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,959
but I just I don't want to have those

222
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:24,420
kind of conversations I don't enjoy

223
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,910
trolls I don't I'm not one of these

224
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,070
people that likes to troll back or fight

225
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,920
back or whatever you know and so yeah it

226
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,060
was difficult for me to find that

227
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,800
community and so I think what I would

228
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,899
challenge people to do that are looking

229
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:38,850
for it and also have that sort of level

230
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:41,160
of discomfort is look for those groups

231
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,449
that are out there it's one of the

232
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:44,250
reasons like when the ladies of London

233
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,230
hacking society you know I got

234
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,060
introduced and Eliza Mae asked and you

235
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,070
know brought that one forward I was such

236
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,720
an advocate for that because I thought

237
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,279
you know here here's something that

238
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,350
people can go to it's why I think things

239
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,329
like b-sides as well you know these are

240
00:09:57,329 --> 00:09:59,250
great and what started off as sort of

241
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,140
community driven efforts for people to

242
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,449
be able to go meet others face to face

243
00:10:03,449 --> 00:10:05,550
and not necessarily feel you know

244
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,140
immediately that possibility of

245
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:12,000
confrontation yeah and if you want to

246
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,490
continue sorry mate I stole your thunder

247
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:19,949
somewhat that there's a surprise no not

248
00:10:19,949 --> 00:10:22,529
at all and I think I think Becky like

249
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:24,870
you now looked at is probably one of the

250
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:28,730
leading ladies in in in the London

251
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:31,380
Information Security scene and I do want

252
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,019
to zoom in a little bit on the London

253
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:37,380
the lady London hacking Society do you

254
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,589
see value in sort of these peer groups

255
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:42,899
because I understand that that

256
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:45,740
particular society or group is

257
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,079
completely across spectrum in that it's

258
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:51,360
people just starting out but then

259
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,639
there's like some people that have been

260
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:56,870
in the industry for a very long time

261
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,760
yeah definitely but you know I think it

262
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,270
takes all

263
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:02,040
kinds of communities for us I think

264
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,740
people will if they give themself an

265
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,150
opportunity to do so I think hopefully

266
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,010
they can find a community where they fit

267
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:09,600
they can find that niche where they fit

268
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,880
I mean it's like if you look at religion

269
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,290
it's why we have you know a ton of

270
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,180
different religions people need to find

271
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,010
what feels right for them in order for

272
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,410
them to to find that fit in their life

273
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,900
and I think with the ladies of London

274
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,120
hacking Society is fantastic because it

275
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,000
does have you know a great deal of

276
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,080
expertise and I think they need that

277
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,600
expertise to help create the lessons and

278
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,760
introduce the content and drive the

279
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,070
topics and help the other people but

280
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,050
then you also get you know those folks

281
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,150
that love to help and so you know

282
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,500
they're just there helping others still

283
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,300
want to learn and so it creates again

284
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,980
that environment where people feel that

285
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,680
it's okay to be a newbie and and I think

286
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,480
that is sometimes the challenge you know

287
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,920
in our industry is that I think you come

288
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,270
into and especially if you're a woman

289
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,920
again you know you come into it you're

290
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,110
like I don't feel discomfort you know

291
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:00,690
immediately I'm a newbie everyone could

292
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,280
read it on my forehead I just what I

293
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,500
crawl into a rock and so I think having

294
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,190
that that type of place is important

295
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,930
that's great so within within the

296
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,840
confines of like the upper echelon of

297
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,960
being in an organization I mean

298
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,890
obviously some people are going to be

299
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:21,360
respectful and then some other people

300
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,440
are are difficult maybe you know seeing

301
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,990
you as an executive how do you kind of

302
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,730
deal with those sort of circumstances

303
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,270
where you're gonna have to realign

304
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:36,510
somebody's beliefs is there any sort of

305
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:40,070
ideas or techniques that you can share I

306
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:42,750
think I get the question I'm gonna

307
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,940
answer it in the way that I think I get

308
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,060
the question how about that the thing

309
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,740
that's been super interesting for me

310
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,420
being in a quote-unquote executive

311
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,940
position is I would consider my first

312
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,040
executive roles to be with digital

313
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,230
shadows where I was a member of that

314
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,240
this very small obviously was a startup

315
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,820
a Texaco team and then obviously coming

316
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,590
into this road with the bank it's also a

317
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,070
small Bank we're only about 1,500 people

318
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:09,990
but it's been interesting to me because

319
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,850
you do get treated differently even

320
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,529
though I myself don't

321
00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:15,689
feel differently and the thing I found

322
00:13:15,689 --> 00:13:17,819
most challenging whenever I was at for

323
00:13:17,819 --> 00:13:19,379
example digital shadows mine stepped

324
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:21,149
into that role is I was treated

325
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:24,779
differently and I wasn't I was no longer

326
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:26,850
sort of included in some of those inner

327
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:29,069
circle conversations you know so it was

328
00:13:29,069 --> 00:13:32,819
trying to balance being the normal goofy

329
00:13:32,819 --> 00:13:35,339
person that I always am with this sort

330
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:39,180
of oddly passionate view about security

331
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,639
and humor and you know the way I feel

332
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:44,339
about diversity inclusion and injecting

333
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:46,050
all of that into the role but still

334
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:48,600
being taken seriously in the role and so

335
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,009
I guess in terms of resetting

336
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:53,040
expectations um one of the things that

337
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,139
happened to me is I kind of went through

338
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:58,199
a period of crisis about it and I ended

339
00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:00,449
up talking to some phenomenal you know

340
00:14:00,449 --> 00:14:02,339
other people in the industry and one of

341
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:03,569
those people I'll give her a shot at

342
00:14:03,569 --> 00:14:06,689
right now was Emma Smith and if you

343
00:14:06,689 --> 00:14:08,879
don't know Emma I'm she's the the that

344
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:11,160
she's basically director of security at

345
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,870
Vodafone but only because she doesn't

346
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,399
get to use the title because Vodafone is

347
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,720
a little crazy with the titles but she's

348
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,660
the Group C so a Vodafone like wow yeah

349
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:23,490
yeah and amazingly yeah yeah just you

350
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:26,220
know mind-boggling cred but um the thing

351
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,019
that was amazing about that you know

352
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:29,250
with her whenever I was going through

353
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,750
this crisis of confidence and everything

354
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,910
you know I was like I should I change I

355
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,800
might you know I shouldn't be me how do

356
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,959
I do this job and and she told me she

357
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,000
said Becky she said you you have to

358
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,649
being yourself she said you know you

359
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:42,990
have a passion for what you do that's

360
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:46,230
what drives you if you change and you

361
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:48,120
try to conform with something that

362
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,220
you're not then you're not gonna be

363
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,899
bringing that passion with you and so

364
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:54,300
into work every day and for me that was

365
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,120
just mind-blowing you know and that

366
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,439
changed everything for me

367
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,360
and it helped me to realize then when I

368
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,160
went for the seaso role I interviewed

369
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,559
for C so well for a year and a half well

370
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:07,559
I was because I I knew what I wanted I

371
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:10,050
wanted to be myself I wanted to be

372
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:13,259
appear to the CIO or CC or whomever and

373
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:14,819
I wanted to work on that best

374
00:15:14,819 --> 00:15:17,309
organization with a manager that I could

375
00:15:17,309 --> 00:15:19,769
learn from and once I had decided that

376
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:21,959
it was okay I was going to go for what I

377
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:24,480
wanted I was gonna be myself and it took

378
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,660
me a year and a half

379
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:28,330
the right fit but I feel so fortunate

380
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:29,890
that I've landed where I have landed

381
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:31,900
because I'm with a superb group of

382
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,210
people and my manager is Rockstar

383
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:36,640
awesome that makes a huge difference

384
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,360
so 2019 obviously a big year of change

385
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,210
for you personally professionally you

386
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,920
know a lot of people are looking into

387
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,020
their crystal balls and are they going

388
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:49,720
you know what's in the future type of

389
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,420
thing you know do you see it's the same

390
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,000
old same old or do you see some new kind

391
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,900
of challenges coming on their horizon

392
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,060
where are you and sort of the look into

393
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,900
the crystal ball well that's it that's a

394
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,310
good one I think there's always going to

395
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,440
be a bit of the same MO same oh and I

396
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,300
think I heard freaky clown say something

397
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,980
similar to that and I'll have to agree

398
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,180
with him you know being in the industry

399
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,830
for a long time you see a lot of this

400
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:16,990
stuff going around and coming back

401
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,790
around full circle and I think we will

402
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:22,540
continue to see that I think we're gonna

403
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,340
see some other interesting things come

404
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,740
to the surface as well so a couple of

405
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,230
the things that I have been harping a

406
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,810
little bit on is I think that we have

407
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:34,570
this ever-growing volume of technical

408
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:37,390
debt and I don't have a sense of

409
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,890
confidence that companies are dealing

410
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,870
really well with the technical debt and

411
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:43,120
then in particular that security is able

412
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,030
to keep up with technical debt and as a

413
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:48,670
result of that one of the silly term

414
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,680
that I coined that I then found out an

415
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,960
actual security startup had also started

416
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,310
using but I started calling it at the

417
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:56,230
bank I started referring to a shadow

418
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,990
risk and so I started talking about the

419
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,670
fact that you know we have to be very

420
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,890
aware of shadow risk and of it having

421
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,839
been created through this process of

422
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:07,030
quickly developing products looking to

423
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,650
get to customers you know looking to get

424
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,300
to the market taking it being some open

425
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,010
banking you know all the cool exciting

426
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,240
things that are happening with new and

427
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,660
developing technology but then because

428
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,400
we're trying to move at that speed and

429
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,670
at that pace and we're taking shortcuts

430
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,380
where we think that we can and then

431
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,670
where sometimes we're losing sight of

432
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,290
the technical debt that's accumulating

433
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:29,050
as a result of that it kind of feels

434
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,940
like it might be creeping up on us a bit

435
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:34,600
and so it just it to me it feels it

436
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,650
feels like we need to pay a lot of

437
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:38,700
attention that as we go into 2020 and

438
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,590
the other thing I'll say is as we see

439
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,420
more and more people go into you know

440
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:46,410
these monolithic you know cloud

441
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,630
providers I think we need to be super

442
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,570
careful that we don't recreate single

443
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,790
points of value there for you know any

444
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:54,960
issues that might occur in those

445
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,880
environments that bring the world to a

446
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,960
screeching halt

447
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,610
like discord I wasn't gonna second mad

448
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,200
you said we couldn't say it

449
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,470
Becky can ask you a question yeah sure

450
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:10,650
so in your role you presumably you're in

451
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:13,650
meetings with the chief finance officers

452
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:18,180
see CEO CEO chairman etc etc and their

453
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,890
conversations are generally about growth

454
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,290
plans and projections and profit loss

455
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:25,380
and shipping the operational overhead

456
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:28,680
down and all that kind of stuff how are

457
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,090
you finding those conversations from a

458
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:32,220
security point of view are you are you

459
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,570
getting a lot of traction when you're in

460
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,760
interjecting with business impacts and

461
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,840
security you know all that kind of stuff

462
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,790
I'm just interested in how the dynamic

463
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,470
works and those kind of at that level in

464
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:45,870
the organization yeah I think for

465
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:48,990
starters it's I've been brought in to

466
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:51,030
like I participate in the brcs of the

467
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,530
board Risk Committee I just did my first

468
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,150
cyber update to the board Risk Committee

469
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:57,630
and the thing that's you know

470
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,070
interesting about that is obviously

471
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,080
they've made time during their extensive

472
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,310
agenda I mean you know they're looking

473
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:05,730
at what 200 300 page Dax for these

474
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,800
meetings yeah you know they make fifteen

475
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,840
minutes for me to come in and do sort of

476
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,240
a quarterly or or biannual you know

477
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,370
cyber update and the thing that I was

478
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:15,930
really impressed by because I sat in on

479
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,520
the first one I didn't give it but I sit

480
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,380
in on the first one in May and I was

481
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,230
mega impressed by the questions that

482
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,660
were asked and I was mega impressed by

483
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:28,770
the fact that there was legitimate care

484
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,150
and concern you know around the security

485
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:32,700
aspects now on the flipside right their

486
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,190
main focus is we need to keep the

487
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,690
business going because we have these

488
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,190
customers you know that are depending on

489
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:41,670
our services and the obviously there's a

490
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:43,470
lot of regulatory cares and concerns as

491
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:45,720
well you know there's the SMF so the

492
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,350
senior managers regime and the

493
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:53,230
framework see didn't work yeah and so

494
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,850
there's been you know different

495
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:56,350
liabilities that are at stake so there's

496
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,789
a lot of things that come to play

497
00:19:57,789 --> 00:19:59,620
especially in the financial services

498
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,660
world which has been really interesting

499
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,650
for me to learn about but again it's the

500
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:07,750
I've been impressed with the way it's

501
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,130
coming together it doesn't mean there's

502
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:10,419
still not a lot to do there's still a

503
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:12,039
chance to do right it's by no stretch of

504
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:14,350
the imagination perfect in my experience

505
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,539
so far but I just always tell people

506
00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:19,840
that's job security for us I wanna I

507
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,700
want to say one of the ugliest words in

508
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:25,780
banking to you oh it's that TSB did you

509
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:28,900
read the report I've not read the report

510
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:32,260
yet okay so I found it a fascinating

511
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:36,190
study in when management doesn't listen

512
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:38,650
to the people on the ground and

513
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,539
management believes that something can

514
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:43,090
go into production with like over 200

515
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:49,059
identified issues yeah I think you you

516
00:20:49,059 --> 00:20:50,860
nailed it Becky

517
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,650
on that issue is that it is a real

518
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:57,100
business problem and I think security

519
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:01,210
and regulatory regimes are just going to

520
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:04,539
get even tougher as soon as as we move

521
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:06,909
forward yeah yeah no I agree

522
00:21:06,909 --> 00:21:08,770
I mean look again the regulars coming

523
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:09,700
down the pipeline there without

524
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,710
brazilians right and operational

525
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,090
resilience is something when I first

526
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:16,150
came into the job I hadn't heard of it

527
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,470
obviously I wasn't keeping up at that

528
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,510
stuff so I went and read up a little bit

529
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,559
about it and I have to say I was

530
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,720
actually surprised I was pleasantly

531
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,390
surprised because what I saw was the

532
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,159
regulator's looking at operational

533
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:29,740
resilience and saying basically you know

534
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,659
having disaster recovery having business

535
00:21:31,659 --> 00:21:34,030
continuity planning that no longer is

536
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:36,700
alone right it is going to be good

537
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,450
enough for us

538
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:39,700
great you're gonna keep your backup

539
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,409
processes running and everyone's gonna

540
00:21:41,409 --> 00:21:43,120
be able to check their slack messages

541
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,580
Whoopie that's no longer the focus the

542
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,010
focus now with our Brazilians is on what

543
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:50,590
is the bare minimum level of service

544
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:53,590
that keeps the customer happy and keeps

545
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,510
the customer up and running and it's

546
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:57,909
also no longer focused on if you have a

547
00:21:57,909 --> 00:21:58,720
problem

548
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,150
now our Brazilians is all about pay when

549
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:02,980
you have a problem how are you going to

550
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:03,970
keep those service

551
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,770
is that the customer depends upon up and

552
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,480
running and of xs-1 available to them

553
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,300
and the regulator is demanding answers

554
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,000
to these questions and that to me is

555
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,980
fascinating because I love to see the

556
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,260
regular who is oh so so often picked on

557
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,690
and harp dawn right I love to see them

558
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:21,040
doing something that to me feels like

559
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,350
the right thing to do what I wish we

560
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,700
could do is figure out how to do that

561
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,640
across industry across all the verticals

562
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,790
and demand that level of focus because

563
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,380
we're going to continue to see these

564
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:37,500
problems happen yeah absolutely right a

565
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,090
little point I'd like to make so for

566
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,400
years we've had standards okay so we're

567
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,760
looking at ISO 27000 and X and all that

568
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,640
kind of stuff for looking at the PCI DSS

569
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,020
we're looking at the do DPR they're all

570
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,520
kind of independent of each other but

571
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,220
they're kind of broadly focus on things

572
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,960
like data breach prevention and

573
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,760
protections of privacy and art kind of

574
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,210
stuff well oh is it now time that we saw

575
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:04,900
a kind of international standard around

576
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,420
information security as a thing around

577
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,490
operational security so I look at the

578
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:12,070
ISO 27001 documentation it still reminds

579
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:14,410
me of punch cards that is more than good

580
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:16,540
and stuff like that and things we've not

581
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:19,120
done for 25 years around information

582
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,430
security is it time we now have

583
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:23,290
something a little bit more close to

584
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:26,140
what we actually do and with a mandate

585
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,200
and the teeth to enforce it

586
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,170
well yeah I agree absolutely it's

587
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:33,870
something again I've been sort of

588
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,820
kicking about in several different talks

589
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,710
over about the last year because I think

590
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:39,400
so as well

591
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,470
and I think until we see that on a

592
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,210
global level I don't think we're ever

593
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:45,820
going to have security get where it

594
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:48,520
needs to get you know taking care of

595
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,440
people's data in all of these different

596
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,180
tools services and settings you know

597
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,830
that we now have a huge dependence on

598
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,540
yeah and again the thing that really

599
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,370
fast I mean fascinates me about it right

600
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:00,400
it's ten years it's really ten years

601
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,680
that we've had this change granted

602
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,420
they've had you know ARPANET and

603
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,010
everything from way back when we've had

604
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:08,410
all this growing curiosity and

605
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:11,200
dependence and digital evolution but

606
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,660
it's the ten years since social media

607
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,650
came to the forefront and then we got

608
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:17,830
ten

609
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:20,500
analogy and the Internet into the hands

610
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,510
of people every day on the mobile phone

611
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:25,210
that is what has made the difference and

612
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:27,610
so now the next 10 years it's gonna say

613
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:30,399
and show us where are we gonna go and

614
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:32,470
are we finally gonna wisen up on the

615
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,850
right way to do it and if you think

616
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:36,279
about Moore's law screw Moore's law man

617
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:38,559
we're having to evolve as humans dealing

618
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:39,909
technically with all of this digital

619
00:24:39,909 --> 00:24:42,309
stuff we're having to evolve beyond our

620
00:24:42,309 --> 00:24:45,070
capacity to evolve this quickly but we

621
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:48,760
gotta figure out how to do it completely

622
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:52,179
agree yeah ok Becky well thank you very

623
00:24:52,179 --> 00:24:54,940
much indeed for your time well thank you

624
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:58,630
guys yeah I wish you the best of luck

625
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,580
with the rest of it thanks ever so much

626
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:06,779
thank you guys ok brilliant thanks Becky
