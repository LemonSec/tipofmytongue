55
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:27,780
just smashing forward I don't know I

56
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,200
came in so I've worked in a

57
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,030
male-dominated industry and I'm not

58
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,959
trying to make this about gender or

59
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:35,909
anything but I worked as a mechanic all

60
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:38,129
through college and I'm used to shop

61
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:40,530
Talk I'm used to you know people not

62
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,840
being your best friend or people not

63
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,790
thinking along there or something

64
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,680
whatever so I don't know it wasn't

65
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,829
really that different for me coming in

66
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:51,659
it was a cool another field where people

67
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:53,609
don't really think there's some people

68
00:02:53,609 --> 00:02:56,629
that just don't want me here

69
00:02:58,939 --> 00:03:00,900
exactly yeah there's always gonna be

70
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,669
people that don't want you there and

71
00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:04,560
people that don't like you I mean you're

72
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,090
not gonna please everyone right so yeah

73
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:11,519
there's some I'm gonna just ignore I've

74
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:12,930
gotten a lot of flack for kind of

75
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,750
keeping my messages open but I find that

76
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,030
people that I've gotten to help kind of

77
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,859
outweigh having this if there is some of

78
00:03:19,859 --> 00:03:24,859
the crap that I get in my inbox and

79
00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:27,000
there are other people that I go to you

80
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,299
there's a lot of people like Caitlin and

81
00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:31,590
Caitlin badass button and then Allie

82
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,419
acid got us there like two of my best

83
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:36,299
friends so the three of us kind of you

84
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,919
know we can lean on each other we need

85
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:40,169
to oh and a lot of other people in the

86
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:42,180
industry like Ian cold water reached out

87
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,500
to me the other day and said some really

88
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,530
really nice things just about cool you

89
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,150
know being in the industry and I don't

90
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,069
know I think there's kind of a core

91
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:51,930
group of people that you can really rely

92
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:56,400
on and I can can I help you through some

93
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,979
of the hate that you get everyone well

94
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:03,359
so they can ask you a question being

95
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:05,759
that you need in your own words to the

96
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,930
industry you're new to tech you new to

97
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,329
Twitter and like I say joint you joined

98
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:16,079
a year ago you've got twenty six

99
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,889
thousand followers

100
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,320
you should see our Instagram follower

101
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,300
accounts outrageous I've not been

102
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,990
looking in but yeah you know that is a

103
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,900
significant number of people that

104
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,070
listening to what you've got to say and

105
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,720
are interested in the things that you're

106
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,980
doing and all that kind of stuff

107
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,680
am i right in saying that to a point

108
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,420
recently you were involved in the banner

109
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:47,280
stuff yeah yeah I know I don't work for

110
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,020
them or anything but I definitely you

111
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,390
know I'll share something that they post

112
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,340
on their behalf it's definitely an

113
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,870
organization that I'll totally support

114
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,290
sure so I guess the question is what

115
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:02,270
does your day look like on social media

116
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,650
yeah especially I don't know and weird

117
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:08,280
like for jobs to so I just and we're and

118
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,530
work out regularly cuz I think you know

119
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:13,140
you you have like the mind body thing

120
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,690
going on to focus and stuff I know

121
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,400
that's a big part of your message out

122
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:17,700
there

123
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,540
I like lifting yeah yeah yeah I know so

124
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,250
like I mean my regular day I guess on

125
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,140
social media and just in general I mean

126
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,510
I'm always up super early I think a lot

127
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,710
of the answer is just really don't sleep

128
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:32,310
all that much yeah I yeah I get up early

129
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:36,480
you know a lot of my my stock is kind of

130
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,750
all over the place I have people in Asia

131
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,850
I have people in Australia I have people

132
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,700
in India and I have a lot of mightiness

133
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,580
in the UK as well so my calls are like

134
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,290
all over the place in terms of times

135
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,850
like there's times that wake up super

136
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,250
early in the morning you know have a

137
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,570
couple calls and like kind of take the

138
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:57,270
middle of my day to just like do the

139
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,410
things that I need to get done and then

140
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,120
I'll usually end up logging on you know

141
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,910
later in the day again and at night as

142
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,950
people you know that I have to work with

143
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,720
are kind of coming online so I kind of

144
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,640
work like a weird split almost like I

145
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,620
get up early I get a lot of stuff done I

146
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,180
kind of take the middle of day and do

147
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,470
the things that I need to get done and

148
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,520
then like the evenings I'm back to work

149
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,870
but it kind of works out because I think

150
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,820
a lot of people are really active on

151
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,410
social media kind of in that middle of

152
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,950
the day and

153
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,210
seems to be what I have time to post so

154
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,250
if you if you had advice for like a

155
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,980
young lady or young young man coming

156
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:35,880
into InfoSec Twitter what would you tell

157
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,530
them what do they need to know that you

158
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:41,910
didn't know when you started um I think

159
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,530
a lot of it is so people are going to

160
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,090
act I didn't know a lot more than you

161
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:49,470
and that's not always the keys but there

162
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,060
are people you can learn from as well so

163
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,770
it's you really gonna take kind of

164
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,510
things that people say at face value you

165
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:57,050
can't get a friend out super easily I

166
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,220
don't know if you're easily if I'm

167
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,400
noticed you're super sensitive it's

168
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,380
gonna be a hard place for you because

169
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:08,550
people are not always nice and it's not

170
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:11,190
seeing anything specific about InfoSec

171
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,080
twitter but just i mean the world in

172
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,610
general you're an encounter knight not

173
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:19,140
nice people all over the place are they

174
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,850
are the majority of your followers of

175
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:23,010
the inputs that community or is it like

176
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,720
a wide range because you've got a lot of

177
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,300
different interests right I do it I

178
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,520
would say like 80 to 90 percent are

179
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,400
probably InfoSec Wow okay yeah that's

180
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,230
what yeah at least as far as I know at

181
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,660
least the people that I've engaged with

182
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,280
so clearly Mike and I are doing stuff

183
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,770
wrong then I think that's the big

184
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:43,590
takeaway right I don't know man I mean

185
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,000
I've had a lot of people criticize me

186
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,200
and say like why do you post things that

187
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,919
aren't InfoSec and I'm like I'm not oh

188
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:53,390
that's Shawn do you want to talk about

189
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,400
how they use your personal Twitter

190
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,130
account to not do anything according to

191
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:01,680
whatever that one's I love that level of

192
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,410
gatekeeping of how you know oh I follow

193
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,540
you because he post him for SEC but he

194
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,370
posted something about cats so now I'm

195
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:11,790
not gonna follow yes yes people give me

196
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,500
a lot like or they'll be like oh why are

197
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,380
you posting you know I still work as a

198
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,510
genetic scientist as a consultant and

199
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,560
people are like why are you posting

200
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,419
things about genetics that's not InfoSec

201
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:23,520
and I'm like I'm allowed to like more

202
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,620
than one thing you need to calm down

203
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,540
it's one of the things I think on

204
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,210
Twitter that really pisses me off above

205
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:34,140
all else because it's my persona it's a

206
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,770
long list

207
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:40,630
long list but it's my persona I don't

208
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,599
lie about Who I am I don't make any you

209
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,480
know false pretences about what I do and

210
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,220
all that kind of stuff and I love the

211
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,800
Liverpool Football Club and I you know

212
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,560
but occasionally about posting about

213
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,019
football because people are gonna lose

214
00:08:56,019 --> 00:08:59,110
their [ __ ] about it you know and my

215
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:05,529
answer to that is well [ __ ] you it's

216
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:07,810
your Twitter post whatever you find

217
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:09,519
interesting if people don't like it then

218
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,930
they'll unfollow you and that's great

219
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:14,529
like if they don't take interest in you

220
00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:16,360
having interests as a person or they

221
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,380
someone you really want in your life

222
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,600
anyway but it's a really good point

223
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,570
because I don't know the narcissist in

224
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:25,120
people would be about gaining followers

225
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,850
but I do find it kind of loosely

226
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:31,829
liberating to lose followers sorry

227
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:34,420
you're making points right like it means

228
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,060
if if you're causing if you're making

229
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,980
waves then you're doing something right

230
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,310
to an extent I mean if you're like tune

231
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,569
extent there's there's awkward

232
00:09:43,569 --> 00:09:45,279
circumstances obviously but yeah

233
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,029
absolutely

234
00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:47,860
or in Mike's case it's just getting

235
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,889
banned from Twitter yes that does happen

236
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:53,019
have you been banned yet from Twitter I

237
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:55,540
have not someone thought I was and they

238
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,449
sent me like a they texted me and we're

239
00:09:58,449 --> 00:10:00,699
like congrats on your first winner man I

240
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:03,449
was like wait what did I do

241
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:08,260
it wasn't me it was Caitlyn okay but it

242
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,790
was it was for something that she had

243
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:13,029
said on my post oh so I guess I don't

244
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,620
know they got confused but it was it was

245
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,060
that guy who said that really nasty

246
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:19,660
stuff to me and Kaitlyn commented on and

247
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:23,470
was like I will I think she said I will

248
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:27,300
fling that man into the Sun or something

249
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,060
yeah yet we have a president that can

250
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,949
you know threaten to nuke another

251
00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:38,800
country that was that was a word I not

252
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,720
even learned and bear in mind Gabon oh

253
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:48,010
okay no [ __ ] afraid you're old but yeah

254
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:51,400
somebody used the word heat and

255
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,650
that's a good eating somebody into the

256
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,990
Sun which is what that that dude said in

257
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,600
that response to Kaitlyn I think yes I

258
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,240
what the [ __ ] does Yeats mean I don't

259
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,070
want to go galette just tell me if it

260
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,320
means to thrill but it's like I don't

261
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,730
know I've argued with people about like

262
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,170
the past tenses of a teyla gives the

263
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:11,849
past tense yo or is it even

264
00:11:13,059 --> 00:11:15,118

265
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:22,079

271
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,189

all that kind of stuff

277
00:11:59,239 --> 00:12:00,979
interesting that you do that kind of

278
00:12:00,979 --> 00:12:02,869
science stuff as well you know yeah

279
00:12:02,869 --> 00:12:05,179
probably none of us do but talk about

280
00:12:05,179 --> 00:12:08,059
somebody work yeah so like I said make

281
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:10,479
it a day is vulnerability management

282
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,439
they have a lot of clients and like

283
00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:14,959
different areas so it's kind of cool I

284
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,579
get to you know deal with health care

285
00:12:16,579 --> 00:12:17,509
and I get to deal with transportation

286
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:20,749
and just kind of cutting my teeth in

287
00:12:20,749 --> 00:12:26,059
that area I outside of my normal 9:00 to

288
00:12:26,059 --> 00:12:27,439
5:00 which isn't really a nine-to-five

289
00:12:27,439 --> 00:12:31,999
if we discuss I yeah I pen test for

290
00:12:31,999 --> 00:12:33,919
black mirage so we have some smaller

291
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,239
engagements we've got some people that

292
00:12:35,239 --> 00:12:36,889
were training up that's also the group

293
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:39,529
that I do a lot of my workshops and

294
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:42,619
stuff with so like Carson the CEO and I

295
00:12:42,619 --> 00:12:45,829
did what about pen test workshop it it

296
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:49,569
lasts Boston month a month or so ago and

297

00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,239
just kind of get to do some cool like

299
00:12:56,239 --> 00:12:57,739
anything I'm interested in like learning

300
00:12:57,739 --> 00:13:00,199
or pen testing or anything I'm just like

301
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:01,279
hey I want to learn this and they're

302
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,980
like cool go for it so it's cool I get

303
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,649
to do my current areas of kind of focus

304
00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:08,809
obviously I've been in the medical

305
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:11,359
device security kind of range for the

306
00:13:11,359 --> 00:13:15,289
last year but oh I'd like to do I owe

307
00:13:15,289 --> 00:13:18,999
tea and vehicle and canvas security I

308
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:21,859
like I said that was mechanics so just

309
00:13:21,859 --> 00:13:24,919
learning about kind of you know the car

310
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:26,029
the different protocols used some

311
00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:27,679
vehicles and then just securing them

312
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,039
it's really interesting to me outside

313
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:34,909
from that like I said I teach for I do

314
00:13:34,909 --> 00:13:36,619
some cyber stuff I do some other

315
00:13:36,619 --> 00:13:39,060
consulting with some other

316
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,740
agencies or entities or whatever and

317
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:46,510
then I got my genetic science gig

318
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,580
whenever that popped something out so

319
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,970
that's kind of a cool welcome reprieve

320
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:55,030
from InfoSec suddenly I get just kind of

321
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:57,750
switch gears and like read a bunch of

322
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:01,090
medical jargon and I don't know it

323
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,040
sounds boring but it's kind of fun day

324
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,390
which it's fascinating this again and

325
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,600
I've said this like four times tonight

326
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,280
somebody that's doing a far more

327
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,070
interesting job than mate in the world I

328
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,900
know this is both humbling and

329
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:21,010
depressing all this discovery the

330
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:24,340
question that I've got for you is when

331
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:27,580
and how did that kind of flip happen

332
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,370
where you suddenly went from being you

333
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,430
know into genetic science and mechanics

334
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,410
and all that kind of stuff into InfoSec

335
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,240
how did that flip happen where did it

336
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:37,660
happen

337
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:41,470
Hey well it started in college I was in

338
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:44,800
college and my majors were actually

339
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,350
psychology and neuroscience law and I

340
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,090
worked as a mechanic because it was what

341
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,470
I was interested in but I knew I didn't

342
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,660
want to do it was my actual job the rest

343
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,890
of my life so that was kind of just like

344
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,450
might get me through college kind of job

345
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:59,230
um so I knew once I graduated it wasn't

346
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,940
gonna be what I did anymore so I would

347
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,730
say that's more of a hobby but yeah once

348
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,470
I graduated I started working in

349
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:09,070
pharmaceutical regulation doing like

350
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:12,270
genetic reviews and piqué reviews for

351
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:15,640
FDA sanctioned studies and along with

352
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,820
that I got to deal with a lot of the

353
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:22,330
medical devices that were under her be

354
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:25,390
even things like that as well and I just

355
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,040
kept getting these crazy reports because

356
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,110
I would always get like these insane

357
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,580
reports anytime something went wrong

358
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,110
during a drug trial like it would hit my

359
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,400
desk first which was always really

360
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:37,180
fascinating but it seemed he thing

361
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,100
happened with medical devices so you

362
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,810
know I get this report and like I kept

363
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:42,130
getting home and they kept saying you

364
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:44,130
know this was able to be breached

365
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,850
they've spent having these

366
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,080
vulnerabilities and I was super

367
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,720
unfamiliar with information security

368
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,970
like I was

369
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:55,869
a tech person at all okay so because you

370
00:15:55,869 --> 00:15:57,819
started as a scientist and a mechanic

371
00:15:57,819 --> 00:16:05,859
yeah that's great Zach yeah so I don't

372
00:16:05,859 --> 00:16:07,569
know I was just interested in it and I

373
00:16:07,569 --> 00:16:08,679
was like I want to learn more about this

374
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:13,889
and so I did yeah so that I just kind of

375
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:19,119
your name that you're familiar with I am

376
00:16:19,119 --> 00:16:22,269
the cavalry right Josh Corman's work

377
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:26,139
yeah so he's working at the public

378
00:16:26,139 --> 00:16:29,139
policy level and you're sort of war at

379
00:16:29,139 --> 00:16:30,849
the time you were more boots on the

380
00:16:30,849 --> 00:16:33,669
ground do you feel like there's a lot of

381
00:16:33,669 --> 00:16:35,829
work to be done in medical device if you

382
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:37,599
feel there's progress or do you feel

383
00:16:37,599 --> 00:16:39,579
like oh my god don't put that ever

384
00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:44,099
inside me because there's been a lot of

385
00:16:44,099 --> 00:16:48,549
I mean yeah the way I kind of came about

386
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:52,539
I don't know we got so I don't know we

387
00:16:52,539 --> 00:16:54,519
just got so hung up on you know all the

388
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:55,720
medical quarters that we were making

389
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,519
like suddenly we have these pacemakers

390
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,869
that we can put in people and doctors

391
00:16:58,869 --> 00:17:00,669
can remotely monitor everything that's

392
00:17:00,669 --> 00:17:02,829
freaking amazing like nobody thought

393
00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:04,359
when they were creating those things

394
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,888
that Oh

395
00:17:05,888 --> 00:17:13,779
someone might Jamie yeah it just wasn't

396
00:17:13,779 --> 00:17:16,419
on anyone's radar at that point and I

397
00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:18,128
mean it wasn't oversight but I don't I

398
00:17:18,128 --> 00:17:19,839
don't think it's all so hard to fault

399
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,209
anyone for it cuz it just really wasn't

400
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:24,039
part of any landscape you know when

401
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:26,730
these things were in development and

402
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:31,419
yeah I I think they're better I hesitant

403
00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:32,799
I mean if like I went to the doctor

404
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:33,669
tomorrow and they're like we're gonna

405
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:35,049
give me a pacemaker [ __ ] alright we're

406
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:39,759
gonna talk but but I don't know they've

407
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:42,129
come a long way I actually have an

408
00:17:42,129 --> 00:17:45,519
article coming out next year probably I

409
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:48,460
gave my first talk ever on medical

410
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,840
device security and I got cornered

411
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,450
afterwards by this lady it was

412
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,159
terrifying actually but she's the

413
00:17:54,159 --> 00:17:57,059
Cryptologic commandant at the NSA and

414
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:59,470
she's like I want to write a paper with

415
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:02,200
you and I was like okay that sounds

416
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,150
that's kind of Awesome I it was in too

417
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,190
I tend to avoid anyone with the name

418
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:13,490
commas on just like I couldn't even I

419
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:14,809
was just like I want to be your best

420
00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:15,730
friend

421
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:19,520
social she's just amazing so yeah we've

422
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,230
got a paper coming out actually next

423
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,510
year I think it's actually a UK

424
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:28,790
publication oh no it's the crap I forget

425
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:32,330
it's called but it's a cybersecurity

426
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:37,250
journal its peer reviewed and we are

427
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,919
going to be going into in depth not only

428
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,720
about you know the specific

429
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,309
vulnerabilities that are plaguing a lot

430
00:18:43,309 --> 00:18:45,169
of the medical device industry but also

431
00:18:45,169 --> 00:18:47,090
kind of what's being done to mitigate it

432
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:48,799
I mean the FDA is put out a lot of

433
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,780
guidance mitre has put out a lot of

434
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,760
guidance they're kind of working

435
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,059
together so it's been a really good

436
00:18:56,059 --> 00:18:59,780
I guess run to train you know secure

437
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,330
some of these things that's great news

438
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:05,390
and fantastic contribution thank you

439
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,690
yeah pretty exciting for my first year

440
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:14,480
yeah so I mean you gave us a little view

441
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,410
of 2020 are we going to see more of you

442
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:21,440
at conferences or are we gonna see more

443
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,260
sort of research like where are you kind

444
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:29,860
of taking taking your career hope both I

445
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,179
kind of have switched gears I mean I've

446
00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:33,799
been talking on medical device security

447
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:36,830
pretty much all year so when I submitted

448
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,870
for blue team Khan I kind of submitted

449
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:39,860
something a little bit different

450
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,929
something that I had been doing some

451
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:44,299
work with and I was interested in really

452
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:46,549
like basically making myself research

453
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:50,000
more of so I'll be giving a talk at blue

454
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,070
team Khan 2020 that's the first storm

455
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,870
that I think I was kind of signed up for

456
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:57,860
but it's on tactical the use of a

457
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:01,370
tactical information so like human

458
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:03,309
intelligence signals intelligence

459
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:05,630
geospatial intelligence and stuff and

460
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,340
how that could actually be helpful and

461
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:12,260
blue team operations so yeah that's

462
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:15,000
gonna be my kind of focus as

463
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,799
I start to ramp up talks for the next

464
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,320
year I'm hopefully doing a couple of

465
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:23,010
workshops potentially in the UK so that

466
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:26,429
could be fun and I really want to get

467
00:20:26,429 --> 00:20:29,730
some more IOT and like I said vehicle

468
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,039
research kind of under my belt start

469
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:33,750
doing a little bit more I've just really

470
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,940
been enjoying you know researching for

471
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,980
myself and like if I feel like I can

472
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,110
write something comprehensive about a

473
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:44,178
topic then I think I understand it so

474
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:49,409
awesome yeah and I want to move we'll

475
00:20:49,409 --> 00:20:54,780
see why do you want to move to Ohio not

476
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:58,799
Sheffield yeah for steel cones but only

477
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,450
all year round she can do workshops

478
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,960
there

479
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:10,260
Scotland's cold and let's cut snow it's

480
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,330
it's an item of it's a sore spot in my

481
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,610
family right now because my mom's side

482
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:17,190
of the family we were like super Irish

483
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,710
like a hundred percent my mom's an Irish

484
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:22,799
citizen so like yeah we're a hundred

485
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,840
percent Irish but she did like the whole

486
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,880
ancestry thing and we found out that

487
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,220
we're like a little bit Scottish and oh

488
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,170

489
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:34,990
[Laughter]

490
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:41,750
you

491
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,070
yeah somebody will always find some way

492
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:48,710
to monetize whatever data they can about

493
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:51,679
you and you don't need that but so one

494
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,960
of the really interesting discussions in

495
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,330
healthcare and you know HIPAA and

496
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:57,679
everything is you can't really do

497
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:02,330
Jennifer DNA size an amazing point yeah

498
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:05,420
yeah yeah yeah so it's it's really hard

499
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,070
I know like there's been a lot of back

500
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:10,880
and forth with you know HIPAA became

501
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,530
more enforced especially with GDP are

502
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,330
kind of started ramping up to you they

503
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:17,330
were like how do we store these sample

504
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:20,660
yeah because like peoples you can't you

505
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,309
can't take you can blind them you can do

506
00:22:22,309 --> 00:22:23,660
whatever you want but there's still

507
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,070
someone's genetic material they can

508
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:27,350
still be respect I mean my information

509
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:30,440
in a breach can be changed right that's

510
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,540
right so my email address I can lose it

511
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:36,130
I don't care my date of birth no account

512
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:40,429
but my DNA absolutely never that's right

513
00:22:40,429 --> 00:22:43,250
the other thing is your DNA's unique to

514
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,320
