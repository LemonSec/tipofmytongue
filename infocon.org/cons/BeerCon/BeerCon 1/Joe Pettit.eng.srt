3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,050
the mini-hats Club beer con 1 thank you

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,060
so much I think you were one of my top

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,470
picks for guests because of your

6
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,900
involvement in tripwire and I have to

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,179
say your publication is giving voice to

8
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:27,029
a lot of information security

9
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:29,400
professionals why don't you talk a

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,440
little bit about your 2019 review what

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,510
are some of the special moments for

12
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,940
tripwire yeah sure yes I thanks for

13
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,350
having me on really appreciate it

14
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,360
it's been great kind of following along

15
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,760
to see what's been going off so yeah

16
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,610
excited to be here so there's been yeah

17
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,040
lots of great highlights this year from

18
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,900
Tribble I might say I mean one of the

19
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,140
things I always try and do with having

20
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,380
spike having a place where we can have

21
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,230
so much influence and people that can

22
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,790
come and contribute give people a voice

23
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,140
in the community I think that's really

24
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,030
important so one of the things that have

25
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,850
been really good the last 12 months is

26
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,200
the work with conveniently different

27
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,509
b-sides organizations so what we'll do

28
00:01:12,509 --> 00:01:14,280
is we'll proactively go out to all these

29
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,159
b-sides all the new ones or the

30
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,990
long-standing ones and just an email out

31
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,609
to speakers just to see if they want to

32
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:23,009
write blog get on their trip no sigh and

33
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:25,049
then we can plug the actual event itself

34
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:26,880
which you know for the ones in like San

35
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,920
Francisco and Las Vegas and London

36
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,109
before that you know they get more than

37
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:32,700
enough people there but for some of the

38
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,100
smaller conferences it's actually been

39
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,200
really useful it's just another way of

40
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,090
getting the name out there just to make

41
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,249
more people in the area know that this

42
00:01:41,249 --> 00:01:43,380
is happening it's been really good and

43
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,579
then from like a personal point of view

44
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:47,280
I would say that's how I get to meet so

45
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,950
many great people in the industry I mean

46
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,600
so many different people I've met and I

47
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,490
could say a majority of them including

48
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,020
through the b-side track whether that's

49
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,469
you know a rookie track at London or

50
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:00,479
something that's more established in Las

51
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,389
Vegas or San Francisco so there's such a

52
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:05,189
wide spectrum of people that have

53
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:07,139
contributed and I'd say that's

54
00:02:07,139 --> 00:02:08,419
definitely been one of the highlights

55
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,100
that's great

56
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,080
and I think the community certainly

57
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,450
appreciates that maybe you could talk a

58
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,270
little bit about si I tend to look at

59
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,290
the tripwire blog as being quite a bit

60
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,850
independent from tripwire the company is

61
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,160
there a sense that you get to kind of

62
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,830
operate your your own show within sort

63
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:30,200
of certain parameters yeah exactly

64
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,730
within certain parameters definitely I

65
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:35,090
mean with a corporate blog you always

66
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,070
have to be careful because potentially

67
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,990
doesn't matter who you clear writing

68
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:42,380
about or to make could be a potential

69
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,790
customer so when a day of breach happens

70
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,080
we have to be careful but I think that

71
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,710
actually gives you the almost gives you

72
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,260
more credibility because we have to

73
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,300
fetch it everything we can't just go oh

74
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,880
by the way this this breaches happen

75
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,560
because this researcher so it has we

76
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,210
actually have to get our verified within

77
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,920
that organization when they really

78
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,630
suppress when they have a press release

79
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,940
go out or statement and we can maybe

80
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,310
talk about it which is which is fine but

81
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,840
yeah go back to your point in terms have

82
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,150
been independent I think it's great that

83
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,130
we we have the ability to do that and I

84
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,530
since I've been doing it for nearly six

85
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:16,850
years now at replying I think that's

86
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,260
kind of always been the strategy where

87
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,510
you do get a lot of corporate blogs and

88
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,280
know to be honest they're pretty boring

89
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,590
because everything has to talk about the

90
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,070
product

91
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,650
everything has to lead back to a sales

92
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,660
pitch and you know there's always going

93
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,010
to be an element of that in there

94
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,990
somewhere because obviously you kind of

95
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,930
have to justify your existence as a blog

96
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,190
actually have the ability to pull gear

97
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,410
in from B sides and talk about you know

98
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,360
things like OPSEC which is not really

99
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,130
related to tripwire as such especially

100
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,050
on their products or solutions on

101
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,580
obviously it's to the wider community

102
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,980
but we can kind of talk about what we

103
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,630
want as long as it relates back to

104
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,070
security and I think that just gives us

105
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,020
a louder voice in the community I I

106
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,450
think there's also a really great sort

107
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,610
of synergy because you know say

108
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,980
something bad happens a tripwire well

109
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,570
you have a lot of friends in the

110
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,970
community you have a lot of people you

111
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,920
have a very positive relationship I

112
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,860
think with the community that that would

113
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,560
that would help when when a company goes

114
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,760
into you know to a crisis mode you know

115
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,978
it yeah I guess you know a rough day at

116
00:04:18,978 --> 00:04:21,200
work for any technology companies to be

117
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,079
mentioned in the

118
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,830
just right yeah so so you know a great

119
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,439
PR strategy is we won't get rid if we

120
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:30,990
don't want to be in the register how do

121
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,629
you feel though when you know you've got

122
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:37,259
a company not your company but you have

123
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:39,300
a company that that you know has made

124
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,599
outlandish claims and and once you know

125
00:04:42,599 --> 00:04:46,349
your brand to support them did you get

126
00:04:46,349 --> 00:04:48,449
that a lot you know I'm thinking about

127
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:50,159
some of the controversies that we saw

128
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:53,819
this year like a crown sterling for

129
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:58,080
instance yeah I mean we try to try and

130
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,400
stay away from that as much as possible

131
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,919
really I think you know there's enough

132
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,629
drama that goes on and I don't think

133
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:05,009
from it especially from a corporate

134
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:06,599
perspective we should really have an

135
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:08,729
important one goes on there or even an

136
00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:12,180
opinion if something is factual and I

137
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,300
have no shoes we was talking about that

138
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,620
but I think when things are you know

139
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,389
there's a lot of speculation there's a

140
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:20,069
lot of fear and self-doubt in the

141
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:23,460
industry generally and being as a as a

142
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,069
vendor because the semi vendors out

143
00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:28,969
there I think is almost their

144
00:05:28,969 --> 00:05:30,599
responsibility to make sure that they

145
00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:32,159
are neutral in a lot of these different

146
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:34,229
discussions so that's kind of my my

147
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:36,779
point and deal on that do you do you

148
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:39,839
ever sort of advise the marketing team

149
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,990
or the PR team at tripwire maybe other

150
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:46,860
companies about what not to do because I

151
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,479
mean you've been in the business for a

152
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,520
while and I'm thinking of the recent

153
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,650
patron exercise bike you know kind of

154
00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:00,360
gross add that was very negatively

155
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,839
received by a very vocal group and

156
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:06,120
causes a 10% drop in their stock market

157
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,969
yeah yeah and I think you know I'm

158
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:11,190
really fortunate that being a good wife

159
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,930
so long now I've learned a lot of a lot

160
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,669
of great people as well as a really good

161
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:17,610
team there was when I first joined and

162
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,349
there is now and that has changed over

163
00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:21,180
the course I mean I'm in terms of like

164
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,770
the Martins I am probably one of the

165
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,839
longest-serving people there now you

166
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:27,900
know but I just think the way we try and

167
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,539
look at it is you know you you obviously

168
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:31,680
a lot of these people they want to take

169
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,110
risks and they want to do things because

170
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,459
then people actually speak about them

171
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:36,090
but

172
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,890
when it comes to marketing the best

173
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:39,150
martini do is in the quality of your

174
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,560
products and your services and that

175
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,850
communication you give to your customers

176
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:44,730
so you know to me don't mean to do these

177
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,440
these publicity stunts and things like

178
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,940
that if you have a solid foundation a

179
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,160
solid base so what's like security in

180
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,990
general isn't really just get the basics

181
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:55,290
right do the foundational stuff and you

182
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,120
know on your word be good be respectable

183
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,710
and then people pick up on that and they

184
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:03,180
appreciate that I think yeah and I think

185
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,530
building that kind of goodwill what

186
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,440
would you say to somebody that's looking

187
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,080
to you know publish something in your

188
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,360
publication what are sort of some of the

189
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,150
top tips that you know you would want to

190
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:20,160
to impart to to young security bloggers

191
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,920
or not even young but folks that want to

192
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,490
to bloggers or talk about an issue for

193
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:29,250
the first time yeah so I think a couple

194
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,900
of things to think about really I really

195
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,110
like the art of storytelling thing a lot

196
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:36,720
of people ride the same things over and

197
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,030
over again about the same issues and it

198
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:41,100
can get quite dull so if you can tell a

199
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,640
story and whether you use an analogy or

200
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,410
a metaphor to do that I really like that

201
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:48,180
kind of content I think that works

202
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,910
really well also I think you've got to

203
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:53,490
write into in a positive manner you know

204
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,080
it's easy to highlight issues and go

205
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,970
this company got breached because of

206
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,200
this it could have been because of this

207
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,900
and focus on those negative actually

208
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,760
sometimes you know most companies are

209
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,080
going to get breached at some point I

210
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,450
keep in mind Joe has published a fair

211
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:10,260
amount of my creation so III maybe just

212
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:14,120
just slightly over that positivity bar

213
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,420
in my writing yeah I think it's okay to

214
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,850
be sometimes negative but as long as

215
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,740
there's a positive outcome at the end I

216
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,230
think that's kind of where I lead do you

217
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,670
feel though that in a lot of cases

218
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,970
you're seeing in the industry the their

219
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:33,900
real descent into SEO optimized articles

220
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,270
you know almost approach and click

221
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:39,270
Beatty you know five things CEOs must

222
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,220
know and the third thing will really

223
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,240
shock you

224
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,520
yeah yeah I mean I think it's an

225
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,779
interview we're pretty good with that I

226
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:49,070
don't see too much of that going on I

227
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,230
think one thing that I've experienced a

228
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,710
lot and I suspect many people in my sort

229
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,810
position of X previously as well as like

230
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,760
some DPN lovely pen companies they'll

231
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,080
come over and go oh we've got this great

232
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,910
blog it's amazing it could be about

233
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,589
wherever you want then halfway through

234
00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:05,870
the blog it'll be like and you also need

235
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:09,370
to include it's best priced VPN solution

236
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:11,750
and then a hyperlink back to the floor

237
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,130
and you know once you've been doing it

238
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,570
while you can kind of pickle I've had

239
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,550
some strange blog content anywhere

240
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,990
actually it's been really good good

241
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:21,050
content right and they're not massively

242
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:22,490
known in the industry and I always like

243
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,290
to give everyone a chance because I

244
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:25,550
don't think you need to have 10,000

245
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,779
followers on Twitter to give the writer

246
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:29,089
or to have an opinion I think anyone

247
00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:30,709
should have an opinion but I've read

248
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:31,850
stuff before and they're not halfway

249
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,830
through it will it'll kind of just say

250
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:36,290
something really strange like and you

251
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:38,600
know you need to spellcheck this and go

252
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,399
until I do something with grammar and

253
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,870
then it links back to some sort of like

254
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:44,060
free writing essay websites I will hang

255
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,080
on a minute you're just trying to

256
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,870
obviously get back late so I think you

257
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,910
do kind of see a lot of people from

258
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,260
outside the industry trying to

259
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,360
contribute and get backlinks I also

260
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,430
think you do get certain strategies

261
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,740
where people think yeah it will shock

262
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,180
people in with headlines and then you

263
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,610
actually read it and then it's nothing

264
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:04,160
to do with that or it can be very funny

265
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,529
or or whatever but you know I think it's

266
00:10:06,529 --> 00:10:09,350
a shame because those top five those

267
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,600
list vlogs are actually really really

268
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,370
interesting when done correctly I just

269
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:15,440
think people they know it gets done well

270
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,900
and it works for a lot of companies it's

271
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,040
a good strategy so they're kind of

272
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,959
exploit it and just twist and do

273
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,550
something different and then people read

274
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:25,520
and go probably just like that but yeah

275
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,740
I do think like they're so kind of

276
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,170
related to that what are your thoughts

277
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:33,730
on the kind of way companies approach

278
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:37,279
new security findings or vulnerabilities

279
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,560
where there's a fancy website put out a

280
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,540
fancy name and logo and all of that

281
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,339
being put out

282
00:10:42,339 --> 00:10:45,230
sometimes it is quite big but other

283
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,170
times it's suspect yeah you know at the

284
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:49,910
end of the world what are your thoughts

285
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:53,510
on that yeah good question I think it

286
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,400
kind of it depends on each individual

287
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,240
sort of situation

288
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,300
I think sometimes Brandon affordability

289
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,070
actually can be a good thing because it

290
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,420
gives you know people I'm gonna call it

291
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,279
CV blah blah blah blah you know they've

292
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:05,779
got something to call it like Mookie for

293
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:08,149
example everyone knows what that is and

294
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:10,279
then especially you know as an industry

295
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:13,070
we can talk about it ourselves but you

296
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,300
know a lot of these people out there

297
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,740
that maybe I'm acting on social media

298
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,870
you know people want to refer back to

299
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,730
these things as something not just a

300
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:22,430
number so I think that is is actually

301
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,529
quite a good thing sometimes to have

302
00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:26,959
that so everyone recognize it but on the

303
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,209
flip side I think sometimes people

304
00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:30,980
create it because they feel like they

305
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,630
need to and then they can blow it or I

306
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:35,270
make a website a fancy logo and it's why

307
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,310
it's not really needed it's not as big

308
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,570
as an issue if you're trying to make out

309
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:41,360
it is so that's kind of where I stand on

310
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:47,480
that cool yeah certainly interesting

311
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,820
I've never really thought of it from the

312
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,670
aspect of having a common name that can

313
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,220
speak to versus a CBE so that's that's

314
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,620
that's pretty interesting take on it

315
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,610
yeah I appreciate I know I think I

316
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:03,290
always I'm very skeptical because we put

317
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,180
a lot of content so I'm always I have to

318
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,589
check back on sources and things like

319
00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:08,060
that so I'm skeptical and I see these

320
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,209
you know they these bookies that have

321
00:12:11,209 --> 00:12:12,740
been exposed and things like that you

322
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,060
know there's the several people image

323
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,770
industry that kind of go after that and

324
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,570
I know there is a company but it almost

325
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,040
seems like that's their strategy they've

326
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,200
got a couple of researchers or finally

327
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,770
something yeah and they just blast it

328
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,570
out to the media and then I I always

329
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:27,709
just stay away from stuff like that I

330
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:29,959
just I don't think it's the right way of

331
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:32,089
doing things I believe in responsible

332
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:33,890
disclosure ideal that I think things

333
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:35,600
need people need to be pushed to make a

334
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,339
change sometimes I I totally agree with

335
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,620
all that but I think sometimes again

336
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,880
similar to the we were talking about

337
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,220
before the titles me and things you need

338
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,450
to know and number three will shock you

339
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,820
people see it as a strategy and then

340
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,890
they exploit it and do it differently

341
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,540
and then that can kind of get everyone

342
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,180
else a bad name when they actually do

343
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,420
meaningful

344
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,540
do you think though that infrastructure

345
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,880
and ilysm is in better shape today than

346
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,290
say looking back four or five years ago

347
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:06,770
or do you see that it's now you know

348
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:09,680
really a marketing

349
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,850
and not much else yeah it's a good

350
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:17,330
question I think it's changed quite a

351
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,110
lot I think

352
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,240
obviously now you know people it's so

353
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,040
easy just to go online and write

354
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,390
something and get it published somewhere

355
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,880
you see websites : obviously these these

356
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,980
websites there are almost scraping

357
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,570
content from other publications and

358
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:31,610
passing off as their own and you see a

359
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,500
lot of that and I think that brings down

360
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,660
a lot of credibility and I do think a

361
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,800
lot of people look at it as a month

362
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,010
until and the sub thing is I know if you

363
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:42,140
look at independent publications yes RSC

364
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,240
magazines if the security europe and

365
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,500
stuff like that I mean instantly

366
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,330
securing Europe is probably little bit

367
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,589
different because has the conference the

368
00:13:48,589 --> 00:13:50,300
back you know so becomes like that

369
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,649
breathing it has a calmness the back it

370
00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:54,649
up with search but SC magazine when Isis

371
00:13:54,649 --> 00:13:56,930
I've had a massive team of writers and

372
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,149
now they they can't there's not our

373
00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:00,980
business model there for them so they

374
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,110
have to do webcast sponsored webcasts

375
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,300
and things like that so it's really hard

376
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,130
to these independent places to survive

377
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,260
in an industry where we expect free

378
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,149
content so then then turns to the

379
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:12,709
vendors where they they can actually

380
00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:14,060
afford because there's something

381
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,770
products and solutions to pay people to

382
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:18,410
come in and write stuff so then you get

383
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:20,120
the ones that are kind of like pushing

384
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,370
it a certain narrative because it backs

385
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,170
up their solutions and products but then

386
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,430
obviously there's the ones that are more

387
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:28,550
independent to kind of have more of a

388
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,950
neutral tone so I think it's probably it

389
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,390
has changed and maybe some time to the

390
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:35,630
bear but sometimes not so I guess one of

391
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:38,720
the major things that tripwire is done

392
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,720
is talk a little bit about your support

393
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,830
via I know at the last couple of

394
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:49,660
conventions you have these tokens and I

395
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,990
believe you allow folks to decide what

396
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,560
charitable organizations to support

397
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,579
mm-hmm yeah yeah we've been doing that

398
00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:00,560
for a couple years now and now I think

399
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,810
it got to the point where you kind of go

400
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,610
to these conferences when you've done in

401
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,829
you know the first few times it's you

402
00:15:06,829 --> 00:15:07,940
know it's great you go around and you

403
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,529
pick up your socks and whatever it may

404
00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:11,089
be your t-shirts but after you've done

405
00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:12,500
it a couple of times and now this

406
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,899
obviously industry thing going on quite

407
00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:17,029
a long time now you see the same things

408
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:18,290
you see in the same junk you know you

409
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:18,740
see people

410
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,290
branded frisbees and things like that

411
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:23,470
and it's just you know people spend

412
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:26,170
the dollars on bringing that to an event

413
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:28,090
and then probably only half they go so

414
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,680
then it's not worth taking the risk box

415
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,030
they throw away or whatever they do

416
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,590
there's so much waste out there already

417
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:35,350
in it we kind of thought well instead of

418
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,970
doing more stuff like that actually

419
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,580
let's just invest that budget and give

420
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,550
it to people that actually need it and I

421
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:44,200
think from our point of view that's been

422
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,640
really good because we've had lots of

423
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,800
good feedback from people saying it's

424
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,540
great you are doing that not just

425
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,760
wasting Martin budget on gimmicky things

426
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,620
but I've also seen him the last couple

427
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,080
years he's in spite of her offenders to

428
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,220
do it which is brilliant people are

429
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,930
stealing the ideas as brilliant and cozy

430
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:01,060
what you're doing is good and I think we

431
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,410
were one of the first people could do

432
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:04,150
that so we were support like girls who

433
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:07,150
code women insecurity ef-s of our

434
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,860
organizations like that so different

435
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,770
ones in the UK to the US and yeah we've

436
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,990
been a blackout RSA it's a secure a

437
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,610
we're gonna do it again at RSA with

438
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:18,120
changing it a little bit this time

439
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,310
players can be more interactive when

440
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,440
it's all donation based I think I think

441
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,060
last year we probably raised something

442
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,040
around and maybe eight ten thousand

443
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,870
dollars for for eight different

444
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,580
organizations over three major events

445
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:33,910
lovely yeah it's good where's where's

446
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,460
tripwire the blog and tripwire the

447
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,770
company going in 2020 what can you tell

448
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:40,510
us about the secret plans for world

449
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,280
domination yeah well I can't tell you

450
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,440
too much obviously it's got to be a

451
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,960
surprise but and I think we're gonna

452
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,100
where we're looking to potentially

453
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,790
launch a podcast

454
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,760
we did a podcast a long time ago and

455
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,260
people kind of left and it didn't really

456
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,290
get picked up by people and it was very

457
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:01,180
very tripwire centric which is fine you

458
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,710
know people do want to listen to what to

459
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,150
work I talked about and we've got some

460
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,829
great people internally but I think

461
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:07,420
we're going to maybe start a podcast

462
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,130
early next year where it's going to be

463
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,930
some internal people who are also going

464
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,220
to go out to the community in getting

465
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,589
more people oh do you want to just not

466
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:16,150
be another podcast like there's so many

467
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,380
out there now so you want to try and do

468
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,940
it a little bit different but that's

469
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,200
going to be something we're looking to

470
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:24,310
push out also just more video content I

471
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,800
mean that is kind of the way things I'll

472
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,410
go and a lot more people are using

473
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:31,390
YouTube as a search engine to find stuff

474
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,910
so you know we want to put more content

475
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:36,520
out there with we've done quite recently

476
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,090
you know you

477
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,850
self where we've we've asked questions

478
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,590
to people in the industry was actually a

479
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,299
responses they've done that we've

480
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:44,649
invited them in a blog with written

481
00:17:44,649 --> 00:17:46,419
answers and then we distribute that out

482
00:17:46,419 --> 00:17:48,190
and things like that I've been working

483
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:50,080
really well so we want to do more of

484
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,669
that we want to do more independent

485
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:54,220
videos as well especially oh then just

486
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,240
some things like that so I think that

487
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,559
they'll I mean I part them doing all the

488
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,059
other stuff we do already they'll

489
00:17:58,059 --> 00:17:59,710
probably be the two things we'll focus

490
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:02,919
on in 2020 variants owning if you're

491
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:05,379
looking for a podcast guests I think yes

492
00:18:05,379 --> 00:18:08,350
a fair palette of the podcast over the

493
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:12,519
past nearly a day yeah sure I think I'll

494
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:13,840
be the list we start with to be honest

495
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,889
we'll just look at that and go through

496
00:18:14,889 --> 00:18:16,389
that more by one I think you could do

497
00:18:16,389 --> 00:18:18,869
worse make yeah exactly

498
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:21,039
he's a good started I appreciate that I

499
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,149
think you know and sorry yeah no I was

500
00:18:25,149 --> 00:18:27,759
just gonna say and sort of he praises

501
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:29,919
upon Joe and and his continued support

502
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,350
of the community and and running an

503
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:35,789
independent slash sort of dependent

504
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:38,019
publication with a voice of reason that

505
00:18:38,019 --> 00:18:40,960
that gives new authors and old authors

506
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,990
an opportunity to talk about the issues

507
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:47,320
that are interesting to them Joe you

508
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,700
know I think we've covered a lot of

509
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,669
ground I just have sort of one off the

510
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:53,950
cuff what do you read when you're not

511
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:57,039
reading submissions the trapar blog as

512
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:02,289
if security-wise all yeah yeah good

513
00:19:02,289 --> 00:19:04,840
question and well I like I like sports

514
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,820
so I read a lot sport particularly

515
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,070
football things I like so that kind of

516
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,690
takes me away from the realms of

517
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:13,179
security but there a lot of food blogs

518
00:19:13,179 --> 00:19:15,580
out there I mean you idea to Bauman's

519
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:18,100
obviously inside the register a grain

520
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,919
clearly a great places to go to actually

521
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:22,720
just kind of learn what's going on in

522
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,149
the industry there's a lot of research

523
00:19:25,149 --> 00:19:26,559
or blogs out there as well out of this

524
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,350
almost like there's so many good blogs

525
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,119
and there's so much content out there

526
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:32,950
you can kind of pick and choose and I

527
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,240
mean we find that with your wide web

528
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,440
being someone's it'd be really really

529
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,149
well and I'm sure we have a pool of

530
00:19:37,149 --> 00:19:39,940
loyal readers but I think people just

531
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,440
start around because there's so many

532
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,789
different sides of publishing so much

533
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:45,580
content is do so many great early blogs

534
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:49,480
out there yeah very very cool well we're

535
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,830
going to think about a joke

536
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:53,080
thank you so much Joe I mean this I

537
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,149
