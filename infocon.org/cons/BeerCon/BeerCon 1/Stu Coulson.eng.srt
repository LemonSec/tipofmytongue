good - - how are you doing for a Sunday

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,820
morning when the entire house is

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,679
completely silent for the first time

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,440
ever before not half 9:00 is quite good

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,840
actually I a normally by now I've got

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,210
children jumped on the bed and you can

9
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,609
go do this dad I just can't do it I want

10
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:26,430
to have a lie-in yeah for once effort

11
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,939
the entire house is Simon so fantastic

12
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:32,070
I could hear my children upstairs and in

13
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,480
a very short space of time they're gonna

14
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,000
be downstairs so I apologize in advance

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,160
for the initial ambient noise that's

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,870
gonna start piping through my microphone

17
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,600
probably in about 20 minutes time Oh Stu

18
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,309
I first met you at b-sides leads and and

19
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:52,079
it was on the back the kids are heroes

20
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,480
gave a keynote this year yeah and then

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,180
we had a chat in the coffee area and

22
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,190
then you came our talk which was the

23
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,949
first ever bear farmer's talk that's

24
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:04,349
right and I believe you found it quite

25
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:07,770
interesting this that's we're not here

26
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,119
to talk about the bear farmers because

27
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,520
that would be very narcissistic but then

28
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,890
winding for which you got involved very

29
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,530
closely in Co organising be sighs

30
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,990
Liverpool I did which was a super

31
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,790
success and everybody had a really good

32
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,369
time it was very warm but I think he's

33
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:25,020
been universally acknowledged it was

34
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,200
incredibly war and then not long after

35
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,329
that I discovered that you and I live

36
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:32,520
around about three miles away from each

37
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,700
other yeah which is which is kind of

38
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,450
really really weird and bizarre but

39
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,729
anyway enough of nostalgia northern

40
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:44,369
humors mother yeah you know what kind of

41
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:47,340
brothers really really but em tell us a

42
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,799
little bit about who you are and what

43
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:52,979
occupies you time served the job and so

44
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,930
I'm yet another security one who's been

45
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,430
around the industry for way too long

46
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,670
than they should have been and is tired

47
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,210
and is kind of a spice have gone through

48
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,649
the roller coaster but or actually

49
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:07,409
started off as a sales guy at NCC group

50
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:09,149
so in technology escrow when it's back

51
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:11,370
in his time I ended up doing

52
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,440
ISO compliance for them

53
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,290
there I've done I've done a lot really

54
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,960
it's normally been front end on client

55
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,720
side but one of the things I realized it

56
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,540
an early age was I was always given

57
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,910
really tough accounts I mean I shall

58
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:30,540
really say logic CMG EDS companies like

59
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,730
that you know the no names policy will

60
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,230
go back into the day to cold-calling

61
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,630
rather than just gone LinkedIn ctrl-f

62
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:40,200
fine names done and and it was just one

63
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,430
of those things that I it was just the

64
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,590
way I did it and I ended up doing sales

65
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,820
training for quite a while actually

66
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,890
training just under 400 people on how to

67
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,820
do seven steps the sale aid is Spain and

68
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,010
really that just how to dig into human

69
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,430
beings nowadays it seems caught you know

70
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,050
social in stage got many things actually

71
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,720
but from my perspective it was in those

72
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,900
days just the way I sold and I still

73
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,790
remember Tuesday having a hand popped my

74
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,170
shoulder so we're going you're pretty

75
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,360
good at social engineering switch points

76
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,830
what the headset often because we want

77
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,450
this to be clean I said a lot of

78
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,980
profanities and told the guy had to go

79
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,290
to go do one because I was on a phone

80
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,330
call yeah and it really took me about

81
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,160
another 10 15 years before it actually

82
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,430
understood that when you start talking

83
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,860
if you ask the right questions people

84
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,110
just these are just somehow like its

85
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,000
firewall drops was put in technical

86
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,010
terms the firewall drops you get in any

87
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,410
any room and just everything comes out

88
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,780
yet yeah and I just I really enjoyed it

89
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,560
so I've used that an awful lot to get to

90
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,220
positions of interest really I've

91
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,769
created the pathway in front of me for

92
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:50,610
example I was made redundant from a

93
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,170
community that what I mentioned but I

94
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:55,380
then spent six months because this you

95
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,700
know part this is gonna be around mental

96
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,200
health I didn't realize that was

97
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,150
massively pressed for six months and I

98
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,760
really lost faith in myself I have no

99
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,280
qualifications to my name of my so 9,000

100
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,890
lead auditor I want to be an info SEC

101
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:11,700
and I have nothing behind to prove that

102
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,340
I can stand in the circuit we call that

103
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:19,100
on many different guises this kind of

104
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,690
you know kind of fakery and holy cord

105
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,700
all sorts of stuff but actually what it

106
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,200
came down to was just shared chill it's

107
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,220
a simple depression

108
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,240
right and off the back of I I did a

109
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,460
last-ditch effort gotta do this got to

110
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,830
do this right and I went down to London

111
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,930
with the last 50 quid in my pocket and I

112
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:41,370
went see a conference which was for DV

113
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:44,670
and s he cleared jobs fair which I've

114
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,320
done hold either of those but you know

115
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,670
she did he gets off into these things

116
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:50,220
cost you yep and that's why I met Social

117
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,100
Security challenge and I'm no longer

118
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,470
with them seconds Todd could openly

119
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,090
about them but actually that was

120
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:59,790
probably the best mental health exercise

121
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,650
I've ever done in my entire life I was

122
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,720
with him for four and a half years and

123
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,040
for those who don't know they are a

124
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,770
not-for-profit that was originally set

125
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,990
up by Cabinet Office so you get people

126
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,240
jobs inside security and I know there's

127
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,490
an awful lot of the magna carta club

128
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,400
people out there who own careers in

129
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,300
cybersecurity single simply down to a

130
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,730
short very small group of people who got

131
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,470
them that first leg up a lot of it

132
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,450
because very similar to myself the

133
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:30,660
career path said I'm a farmer I'm a you

134
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,419
know postman um or whatever and under

135
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:35,160
normal circumstances you won't get a job

136
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,010
inside security like that and exactly

137
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,510
the same way it was with me someone gave

138
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,490
me the break the good thing about them

139
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,020
was their districted way to do it so

140
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,400
pretty much everyone who came through

141
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,540
them ended up with a job in

142
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,110
cybersecurity and that really was a good

143
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,880
self affirming point for me because I

144
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,580
ended up at that point realizing I've

145
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,190
got some skillset I've got some reason

146
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,720
to stand with my head above my shoulders

147
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,260
in this industry I won't go into the

148
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,380
head to the shake of where the money

149
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,380
went to so they were part of funded by

150
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,030
DCMS and you don't have to go too far

151
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:12,000
back in history books look at where DCMS

152
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,590
spent its money recently and how well

153
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:14,130
that went

154
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,980
yeah and they didn't get their funding

155
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,570
so I was made redundant it was quite a

156
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,100
shattering for me at the time is too

157
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,290
before Christmas exactly 12 minutes ago

158
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:24,540
yeah and off the back of that I fell

159
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,360
straight into contractor life so as of

160
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,010
right now I am a freelance contractor

161
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,260
who just finished nine months a

162
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,210
government department which has been

163
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,160
really interested doing security

164
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,969
education awareness for 3,000 techies

165
00:06:38,969 --> 00:06:41,009
whereby most of them are contractors

166
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:42,869
this is an interesting piece I'll talk

167
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:45,119
about in a minute yeah I had the older

168
00:06:45,119 --> 00:06:47,339
land of ir35 my I think the government

169
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:49,729
needs to change his mind

170
00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:52,769
but and it has its little being a

171
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:55,289
sit-down with blank piece of paper with

172
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:56,969
the largest government departments out

173
00:06:56,969 --> 00:06:58,529
there and work how the hell you can

174
00:06:58,529 --> 00:07:00,889
attack a problem and it has been

175
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:03,389
absolutely brilliant because the

176
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:04,619
self-affirmation at four and a half

177
00:07:04,619 --> 00:07:06,839
years of helping other people helped

178
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:08,639
myself get into a really good space to

179
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,739
be able to go right what can we do what

180
00:07:10,739 --> 00:07:14,369
where can I use my skillset best and it

181
00:07:14,369 --> 00:07:17,309
has this panel right excellent

182
00:07:17,309 --> 00:07:19,860
so I guess working for yourself working

183
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,549
as a contractor all the freedom comes

184
00:07:23,549 --> 00:07:25,349
with that and I think you know we're all

185
00:07:25,349 --> 00:07:26,459
aware of how that works

186
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:29,879
how obviously you don't work you don't

187
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:31,349
get paid and you don't get paid if

188
00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:32,849
you're sick and you don't get paid for

189
00:07:32,849 --> 00:07:34,229
your on the holiday and all that kind of

190
00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:34,469
stuff

191
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:36,449
how do you fit that around your life

192
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:39,360
something that it's interested me to a

193
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,679
point the other going contracting but I

194
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:46,289
do like that I do value that kind of

195
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:49,559
being on the payroll arrangement you

196
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:51,179
know you've got you've got benefits and

197
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:54,029
you do have a safety net as it were so

198
00:07:54,029 --> 00:07:56,819
how are you finding them and if I'm

199
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:58,709
totally honest with you I changed my

200
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:01,259
life by zero so my business takes all

201
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:03,689
the money so let's say and for those who

202
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:04,649
don't know how it works

203
00:08:04,649 --> 00:08:06,839
I've got a company to call hidden text

204
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:09,629
that takes all my money so let's say I'm

205
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:11,489
on I'm just gonna put plucking them

206
00:08:11,489 --> 00:08:13,799
about the air I'm on 100 thousand pounds

207
00:08:13,799 --> 00:08:16,379
a year like so that's my contractor's

208
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:17,699
rate and that's how much I'm going to

209
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:19,349
get paid all that money comes into

210
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:22,319
hidden text like a massive big bath full

211
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,439
of water swimming pool full of water at

212
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,669
the back of it I've got a little tiny

213
00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:28,889
host pipe which drip feeds into my

214
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:30,509
normal bank account the stuff that you

215
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:32,759
and I go to Tesco's go shopping with go

216
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:34,078
to the pub with return or in your back

217
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:36,179
pocket yeah so I actually go to a tax

218
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:39,539
threshold in my normal wage which you

219
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:40,740
know keeps you under all the nice tax

220
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,740
bracket etc so if I'm I fill my country

221
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,629
still has money to pay for me to be on

222
00:08:45,629 --> 00:08:48,290
film so right as

223
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,000
as the money's in the business I can

224
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,350
take care of it just a small amount in

225
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,550
the bath still full of water

226
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:55,250
sure so that means that when it comes to

227
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,930
the end of the year and I've finished my

228
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,639
contract to say I'm right now feet up in

229
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:01,279
the and allowing for the feet up and if

230
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,779
I don't going to spend 2,000 Pamela

231
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:04,730
training course because info sets

232
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,089
expensive and I can do I can just go and

233
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,430
spend the business money in a business

234
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,500
way to get me what the next rung of the

235
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,930
ladder so right now for those of you who

236
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,940
know how hard life is in certificates

237
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,519
I'm going to start with my set course my

238
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,209
company set plus not sponsored yes and

239
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:25,579
I'm going to start with doing some

240
00:09:25,579 --> 00:09:27,440
certification but I'm able to do that

241
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,660
because a bankroll goal the money yeah

242
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,910
and I would say to anybody wants to go

243
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:34,910
contracting number one take a really

244
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,220
long good hard look at yourself and

245
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:40,940
create three lists list a is everything

246
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:43,730
I am guru at be honest with yourself or

247
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,880
no good at some stuff sure I write it

248
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,060
down that list then go to list see all

249
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:53,480
this stuff over here I have no idea do

250
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,000
not ever sits turkelton in front of a

251
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,560
firewall and tell him can you add me a

252
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,930
real foot you know whatever I have no

253
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,029
idea what I'm doing and then in the

254
00:10:02,029 --> 00:10:04,490
middle you've got stuff which well okay

255
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:08,300
a bit maybe maybe wouldn't say genius at

256
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,819
it maybe I know some stuff okay

257
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:14,240
yeah you've got those three there you

258
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,399
now know you can't soft with imposter

259
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:17,540
syndrome because I know what I'm

260
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,610
fighting with go stuff over here and now

261
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,620
no stuffing McClement great with and

262
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,209
other stuff I really don't know about if

263
00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:24,740
you want me to stand on stage and talk

264
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,540
about how to set firewalls oh I'm

265
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,730
imposter you know just down the station

266
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,050
is talking about I'm a great list in the

267
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,089
middle I'm never going to give you any

268
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,680
detail from stage and probably pretty

269
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,149
obvious that I don't know a lot about it

270
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:37,220
if you want me to talk to you about how

271
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,880
to you know phone Microsoft's main

272
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,509
incentive databank of seven secretaries

273
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:45,860
people looked after Bill Gates women

274
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,930
with CEO I'll tell you how to do it sure

275
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,910
that's that's my specialist that's where

276
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:52,310
I was at the time and as a result of

277
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,949
that it makes a lot easier because when

278
00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:56,510
you bid for work when you start looking

279
00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:00,350
at ok I want to be a contractor well

280
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,450
what you're gonna do

281
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,130
what she dates to take a job gonna be

282
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,810
you need someone who's got a gap on the

283
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,550
other side so now you need to sell

284
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,830
yourself in a specific way and again

285
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,770
we're not all adept at selling ourselves

286
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:15,850
true and it definitely comes with long

287
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:18,430
hard slog I was quite fortunate that the

288
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:20,050
contractor came to me and said we need

289
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,300
you so it makes me I don't have to do

290
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,700
much selling that day but I'm yeah I

291
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,260
mean cell phone mode at the moment and

292
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:30,010
not right then but just got the new

293
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:32,080
website launched and you know done all

294
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,000
the hard slog of actually sat down I

295
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,120
didn't find services and great cards and

296
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,360
all that kind of stuff and but yeah it's

297
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,280
contractor life good oh yeah it's

298
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,170
brilliant not for the money side either

299
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,780
the money's good oh not shy away from

300
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,700
that money is always good in contracting

301
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,810
what's really good is freedom so here's

302
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:55,300
a challenge you will a day to write a

303
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,610
blog which is close to what your company

304
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:00,130
does and see how many minutes it takes

305
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,530
from marketing gusted to take it down or

306
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,900
the CEO comes along and says but my

307
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,760
name's not on that I wanted to be on

308
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,490
that yeah and that's when you start

309
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,350
realizing as a contract if you say what

310
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,180
the hell you like whenever you like and

311
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,460
you can say it to whoever you like and

312
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,230
that's pretty good and the only person

313
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,760
that you're responsible to of course is

314
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,890
yourself right yeah it's your personal

315
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:23,740
brand and that was given to me many many

316
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,540
many years ago and you know he's not the

317
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:28,840
CEO anymore but rod caught me give me a

318
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,280
shout out thank you very much for that

319
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,690
one person I've learned is most

320
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:35,290
important it was it's a really big life

321
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,670
lesson for me that personal friend is

322
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:39,220
really important so I have a persona

323
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,140
which people know me by on the

324
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,160
conference circuit I was really

325
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,390
interested listen to real relaxed on

326
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:46,960
that how about our echo chamber we do

327
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,280
have a really small echo chamber but

328
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,560
when you meet me in InfoSec circuit you

329
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,750
meet Stuart cults and you meet me as me

330
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,630
if you seem to stood on the stage very

331
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:58,060
different person yeah I don't think

332
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,680
that's important so it's also have that

333
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,720
is to have your characters because

334
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,190
you're going to need them in contracts

335
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:06,460
in to sell yeah but yeah go for it I

336
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,170
absolutely won't get yourself on the

337
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,910
contract circuit the brilliant I'll give

338
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,020
it some thought over the Christmas

339
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,490
period but I think you're right about

340
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,170
the building a brand thing

341
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:17,380
it's something I learned from try mmm he

342
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:21,339
did he did a talk and ecr's lo last year

343
00:13:21,339 --> 00:13:24,310
I think it was and it's not it's not a

344
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:26,829
technical talk it's to talk about your

345
00:13:26,829 --> 00:13:28,450
personal life and how you can break out

346
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:31,089
when you bubble and do new things and

347
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:33,490
change your life fundamentally make it

348
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,350
make a real change to who you are and

349
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:38,170
your personal circumstances and it

350
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:40,540
started in his example with what you

351
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,010
described really which is building a

352
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:44,649
brand so create an identity and that's

353
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:46,449
that's you and still go with it don't

354
00:13:46,449 --> 00:13:49,510
mess around with it be very careful how

355
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,880
you are with people because that could

356
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,889
bite you on the ass sometime in the

357
00:13:53,889 --> 00:13:56,470
future and slowly work it up because you

358
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,019
what you're effectively building is a

359
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:01,449
body of evidence around your ability and

360
00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:03,130
about your own around your experience

361
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,959
and ultimately what you building is

362
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,630
trust and the that people know that they

363
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,160
can trust you and that what you're

364
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,740
saying is valuable and this mallet and

365
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:15,130
and that can lead to opportunities and

366
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,240
that's the bottom line

367
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,610
in there you can you can find a new

368
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,230
career opportunities you can find new

369
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,269
ways of earning money in a way that you

370
00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:23,649
can ever possibly imagine and I think

371
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:25,449
that's what it's all about I told you

372
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:27,040
it's not agree we've we've all got

373
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,649
something we can give whether it's come

374
00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:32,320
from a local charity so I chose that I

375
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,350
helped out and they've got the best name

376
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:37,050
that hyperparathyroidism

377
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:40,240
got that world and and you know I've

378
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,250
helped them out year-on-year just just

379
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,750
little little bits just you know give

380
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,160
them a nudge here and nudge there I'm

381
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,709
free of time but I've learned through

382
00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:50,019
them through my time doing that other

383
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:51,790
things about myself and know it's that I

384
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:57,010
need I didn't know I knew so you met aft

385
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:59,370
remember thing that was like conscious

386
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,750
knowledge and then unconscious not

387
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,440
watching that

388
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,319
yes Isis Oh can't you see competence to

389
00:15:05,319 --> 00:15:07,690
conscious competence yes conscious

390
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,149
competence yeah I think that's an

391
00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:12,670
important matrix that I think a lot of

392
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:14,260
people should play I think we should all

393
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:17,139
learn a bit more about ourselves and I

394
00:15:17,139 --> 00:15:18,550
think it definitely helps from a mental

395
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,589
health perspective because my mental has

396
00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:24,579
never been better shape and I'm a lot

397
00:15:24,579 --> 00:15:26,019
stronger than I've ever had because to

398
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:26,720
know

399
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,149
what my quadrant I'm playing with and

400
00:15:29,149 --> 00:15:31,490
shot the east islip was a really really

401
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,620
hard gate in terms of setting up and

402
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,329
never done any that stuff of really out

403
00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:38,060
of my comfort zone but I play to the

404
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,560
strengths and weaknesses I had on it and

405
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,009
got a conference's result and it's

406
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:44,449
really important that I think people

407
00:15:44,449 --> 00:15:46,430
remember that I've just spotted sailor

408
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:49,069
bike is floating around as well I gave

409
00:15:49,069 --> 00:15:50,750
him some tips on how to stand on the

410
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,589
stage you know stuff like that I can

411
00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:57,800
give that as information and data that

412
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,050
people could think unused to enhance

413
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:03,170
their own quadrants okay but yeah I

414
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,480
think I'm actually sat with my bear

415
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,610
farmers here for you from sticking my

416
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,310
hand at them I know you scar you got a

417
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,379
bit of a ruffle on that one I think

418
00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:14,990
definitely here for you is something we

419
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,759
need to remember we are a really small

420
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:19,160
community we are a small group of people

421
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,959
who fight against some really

422
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,790
interesting adversary's and from a

423
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,740
mental health perspective we need to

424
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:28,699
team up a bit more I owe Daniel card

425
00:16:28,699 --> 00:16:30,410
beer I'm going to say that publicly by

426
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:34,129
the way we heard you it's it's you know

427
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:35,209
there are people like that in the

428
00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:37,759
industry that are out there and doing

429
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,860
good stand at the front end

430
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,839
I don't Oh some other people bears

431
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:42,980
because I've already paid my debts with

432
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,019
some people but equally I'll always buy

433
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:46,430
a beer for most of the farmers guys

434
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,689
because I know that you guys fight

435
00:16:47,689 --> 00:16:50,930
really hard from front lines and you

436
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:53,209
know hashtag here for you you're very

437
00:16:53,209 --> 00:16:53,660
kind

438
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:56,629
it's in fact three miles where you and I

439
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:59,029
need to go and have beers coffees and

440
00:16:59,029 --> 00:17:01,309
all sorts of other substances agreed a

441
00:17:01,309 --> 00:17:03,500
great little truck we'll try and get

442
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,780
that happening sometime in the next few

443
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:09,619
weeks I really like that just in the

444
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:11,659
last couple of minutes we've got what

445
00:17:11,659 --> 00:17:14,209
what's coming up for you so 2020 is

446
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:15,679
going to be a big year right so what you

447
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,169
got what you got going on with the

448
00:17:18,169 --> 00:17:22,039
contracts would be good stuff but this

449
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:23,929
year qualifications that's gonna be I'm

450
00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:26,270
a big thing get some actually get some

451
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,309
body of evidence and about belt that is

452
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:31,970
you know stuff I've been helping my ISP

453
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:35,539
now could see III sec out give them a

454
00:17:35,539 --> 00:17:37,309
shout out because they're do some really

455
00:17:37,309 --> 00:17:39,450
interesting stuff around

456
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:42,610
professionalizing our industry I think

457
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,620
that's gonna be where I'll probably play

458
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,030
a lot them in the space this year is

459
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:50,560
more about okay so you're good show me

460
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,230
try me prove me I think that's quite an

461
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,450
important thing that I need to start

462
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,520
doing a little bit more of where some of

463
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,680
the people I interact with I hear a lot

464
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,570
of people tell me that good at InfoSec

465
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:04,270
okay show me what you mean by that

466
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:07,900
and because unfortunately one of the

467
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,130
things you do come across as a

468
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,870
contractor you're hired is a subject

469
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,850
matter expert there are other people

470
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:15,370
around you who are playing in that space

471
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:17,650
you don't necessarily places in graded

472
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:20,140
you they know stuff but they're playing

473
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,360
a much higher grade around here and they

474
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,980
need to step up to the plate a bit more

475
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,650
and I think that it's important not to

476
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:28,210
call out the fakers but at least I have

477
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,820
a quite worked with them to say look

478
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,840
you're not playing the right space you

479
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,760
need to play in these spaces and play a

480
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,010
bit harder and faster our adversities

481
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,570
are totally not like we've never seen

482
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:38,050
them

483
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,300
I think 2020 would be quite a big year

484
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,950
from that and in terms of my predictions

485
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:46,360
dhtml see if you're listening to this

486
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,990
you are about to have a really big issue

487
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:51,970
in the UK we have a technical debt of

488
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,920
55,000 people some people call it

489
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,420
science skills gap people call it all

490
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:58,000
sorts of stuff we couldn't have 55,000

491
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,890
vacancies that are not filled we do not

492
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:01,870
have a workforce beyond it that you

493
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:04,180
actually recruit into that space not for

494
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,280
about another five years I have hope in

495
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,480
the industry by the way I think five

496
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,000
years time we will have but right ii

497
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,490
don't however there is another technical

498
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:13,900
debt on top of that of the contractor

499
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,360
layer there's about i don't know what's

500
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,560
called a hundred thousand people who

501
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,360
contract in the UK not the number is

502
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,700
actually so our technical debt is

503
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:25,210
actually 150 thousand people not 55 yeah

504
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:27,550
Wow and I think that that's actually the

505
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:30,190
issue that this UK we do not understand

506
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,170
in the olden days they used to be called

507
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:35,470
temps we now call contractors attempt

508
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,180
used to be hired with a permanent

509
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,760
position available to recruit somebody

510
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,590
into who then took over that permanent

511
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,750
role we don't have that nowadays you

512
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,490
have a temp will come in they'll do the

513
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,930
job they'll walk away and there's an

514
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,400
hour gap back to the business

515
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,190
yeah t2 ir35 thousands of people are now

516
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:51,660
out

517
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,670
place suck or like I am with the feeds

518
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,560
upon the bench and we are ending up with

519
00:19:55,560 --> 00:20:00,060
businesses we've got issues now going to

520
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,520
happen because of that we're going to

521
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,830
have a no suspects in the next three

522
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,990
months some scar data breach and they

523
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:09,320
can recite ir35 lack of contractors

524
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,910
helping them build the systems as been

525
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:15,030
