1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,669
so Jake thank you for joining thank you

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:06,270
didn't we get in there that's almost the

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:17,490
end he's going well so okay well yeah I

4
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,029
work for ESET antivirus being with them

5
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:23,340
for a year and a half but previous to

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,990
that I was with the police force down in

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,260
Dorset for 14 years I did a range of

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,570
jobs for the police so digital forensics

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,700
and then I joined the cyber crime team

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,890
that's what I met Lisa Forte you had on

11
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,870
earlier and we did quite a bit together

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,770
and so similar to her I go out and I I

13
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,370
talk about the safety and security that

14
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,559
people need to be aware of in the cyber

15
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,149
security world and that's talking to a

16
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:50,430
range of people usually people who have

17
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,309
no idea so I like to do talks all over

18
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:56,340
the place and I also get to speak to

19
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,609
some great generalists who get to use

20
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:00,960
the cup of my comments and some of the

21
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,760
pieces they're writing so spread the

22
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,159
good word about what everyone's doing in

23
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,840
this space but also you throw a little

24
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,390
bit positivity and make it not such a

25
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,490
dull subject that some people might

26
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:20,729
think it is it's gonna be my my life

27
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:23,580
started back in the day University I

28
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,890
have no idea what to do and my mum said

29
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,360
to me look what do you love know what I

30
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,060
love if you love something you will do

31
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,340
well in it and I said well I love crying

32
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,430
I'm fascinated the crime of too many

33
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,130
cop movies and she said why don't you go

34
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,890
to crime then I thought you you serious

35
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,450
about that she said no no no crime but

36
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,880
won't you go to the police force that's

37
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,460
not bad shouts oh i'm i inundated my

38
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,750
local police force with every job

39
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,149
possibly going and I didn't get any of

40
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:57,560
them I went for nine jobs and got not

41
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:07,229
yeah team and they said hey I'm yeah we

42
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:09,690
just seen you and go for quite a few

43
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,810
jobs we've got something that might not

44
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:13,860
be what you

45
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,830
we're after it's a filing job on her

46
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:20,400
money I saw my foot going into the door

47
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,770
and I said I would take it I am all over

48
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:28,050
this yeah and then a couple months later

49
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,300
I was chatting to what I knew I didn't

50
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,560
know was the commander of the station

51
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,990
and I was that next to him I said so

52
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:39,060
what do you do here I always wanted

53
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,890
someone to say to me and he said do you

54
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,230
not know who I am I said well I'm eating

55
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,510
my sandwich next to him everyone will

56
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,750
start to move away and went oh my god

57
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,690
and we suddenly just chatted so much he

58
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,610
said this is perfect timing

59
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,560
I'd love someone with your background I

60
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,330
think maths and a bit of computing

61
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:59,610
University said we need someone to look

62
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,700
at the statistics around analysis of

63
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,760
crime I'll get that going he loads of

64
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,650
training and from that moment I just

65
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:11,220
loved it and I carried on into then the

66
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,330
computer crime department which was

67
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,690
high-tech crime back in those days and I

68
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,600
got so much training and I just felt so

69
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,420
happy in this space of also helping in

70
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,750
the public but enjoying what I was doing

71
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,190
and learning some even the money was

72
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,049
rubbish I thought this is excellent it

73
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:30,900
just progressed into the last few years

74
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,140
which is basically more InfoSec looking

75
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,450
after cybersecurity but it all comes

76
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,870
back to that love of of crime I guess

77
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,200
right

78
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:47,820
a love of crime awesome so now looking

79
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,670
back on that is it a rough go for the

80
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,620
police are they struggle are they on the

81
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,310
struggle bus I hate to say I think they

82
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,310
are so one of the main reasons I left

83
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,080
the high tech chronic which became

84
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,030
towards the digital forensics unit was

85
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,580
because I look back at the stats I love

86
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,140
going to court for example I love going

87
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,580
to court with some evidence on a hard

88
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,799
drive maybe some murder or whatever and

89
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,430
I got a buzz from that and then toward

90
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,519
the 10 years in the team towards the end

91
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,470
I noticed I went to court for the last

92
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,220
year

93
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,550
I wondered why and it's all because we

94
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,550
are struggling as a police force

95
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,479
Crypton with the likes of tall they're

96
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:36,270
using os's that are just incredibly

97
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,740
difficult to go and get the digital

98
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:41,250
evidence off and it became such a

99
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,960
difficulty I actually yeah I felt

100
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,060
refreshed rating they could throw some

101
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,440
more money at it but they're still gonna

102
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,190
have some serious problems and I just

103
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,720
felt that I wanted to continue helping

104
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,879
the public but I felt that I couldn't do

105
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:56,069
it in the police anymore so I wanted to

106
00:04:56,069 --> 00:04:58,440
move on and although I'm working for a

107
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,710
huge company now I I'm not in sales so I

108
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,569
just go and spread the word about what

109
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:04,979
people can do about how to stay safe

110
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:09,000
online brilliant and so do you think

111
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,610
like the police need to do more of that

112
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,639
out of out of sort of community get out

113
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,919
there talk to the businesses talk to the

114
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:20,960
people yeah and they are doing this yeah

115
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,599
yeah so they've got the cybercrime teams

116
00:05:23,599 --> 00:05:27,060
and they started with these protect

117
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,560
offices it's there and they're all over

118
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,569
the country and they did a great job I

119
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:33,779
know they're even Scott McCready earlier

120
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:36,300
he did of help with them and so there

121
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,409
are some really good people out there

122
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:40,860
doing some fantastic work but yeah it

123
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,180
probably needs more people like that to

124
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,449
do that prevention aspect and it's great

125
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:46,800
that he's coming from the unbiased

126
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,500
police rather than a company doing it

127
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,169
but there's only so far they can do

128
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:54,060
because when people have been here they

129
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,669
they want to go blame someone of course

130
00:05:56,669 --> 00:05:58,379
sometimes the police get a bit of a hard

131
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:00,750
time for this I think sometimes I don't

132
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,039
want to take on the responsibility

133
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:04,740
themselves hence the prevention is

134
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,659
absolutely key but they've got to be

135
00:06:06,659 --> 00:06:08,099
creative and how they're doing it you

136
00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:09,990
got to make people realise how important

137
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,520
it really is and so therefore you got to

138
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,060
make it fun definitely because it needs

139
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,460
to resonate and if it's not fun and

140
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,099
interesting and sort of connected it's

141
00:06:20,099 --> 00:06:22,680
you know and I think Sean used the term

142
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,620
earlier about 28 hours ago when we

143
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,199
started this thing yeah death by

144
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,539
PowerPoint right yeah

145
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:35,219
so now let me ask you question this

146
00:06:35,219 --> 00:06:37,830
cyber security awareness program that

147
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,370
has happened

148
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,880
is it relevant to the threats that you

149
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:46,020
see in 2020 and and beyond

150
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:51,000
um well definitely with the smaller

151
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,840
forces so like Dorsey is littered with

152
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,199
SMEs we've got loads of small companies

153
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:00,389
that maybe have under ten employees of

154
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:02,940
which there are wearing many hats as

155
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,280
you're aware and they don't really want

156
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,199
to necessarily think about cybersecurity

157
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,930
that they might be of a an ilk that

158
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:10,830
wants to stick their head in the sand

159
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:14,400
well those guys have got to be given

160
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,550
tailored advice that doesn't upset them

161
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:20,270
doesn't scare them but make them listen

162
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,380
and it doesn't have to necessarily have

163
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,780
a price tag because they'll usually just

164
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,770
think oh it's going to cost too much

165
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:26,270
money

166
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:29,250
we haven't been hit yet so whatever but

167
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:33,300
so it's a difficult mix but it is

168
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,770
working and it is getting there it's

169
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:37,020
gonna take time and it's great when you

170
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,050
get big companies working alongside

171
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:42,750
forces and programs like the cyber

172
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,760
essentials they can go and talk about to

173
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,560
those people that really need it I think

174
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,590
that's a very good way of getting it

175
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:52,080
across but you have to make them listen

176
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,910
in the first place what would you say to

177
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:56,099
that young boy or young girl that's

178
00:07:56,099 --> 00:08:00,090
about 19 or 20 has good marks is

179
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,910
thinking about joining a regional police

180
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:05,220
force what what do they need to know

181
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,680
that that you know they don't they don't

182
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,680
put in the brochure that's a tough one

183
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,680
because joining the police force is I

184
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,110
think quite difficult if you want to go

185
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,300
specially straight into that niche area

186
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,479
yeah use the will right like yeah well

187
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:23,729
thing is you on three or four years of

188
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:26,580
general Patrol and then if you tell them

189
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,139
that oh you know I really like

190
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:29,160
watersports

191
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,440
they'll put you on high-level rescue if

192
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,539
you say you like high-level rescue

193
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,159
they'll put you on the scuba dive in the

194
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:38,580
unit for body recovery right yes there's

195
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,969
a certain status please yeah if they

196
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:46,470
really show that that passion for it

197
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:48,150
they probably won't get hurt but it's so

198
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,100
difficult to even and join the Peace

199
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:50,329
Corps

200
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:53,360
you have to have an array of skills I

201
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,799
mean the number one skill is

202
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:58,369
communication but it's you've got to

203
00:08:58,369 --> 00:09:00,799
prove in so many different areas that

204
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:02,269
sometimes I think they're making it

205
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:04,220
tough because they they want an

206
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,709
all-rounder an amazing person in every

207
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:09,319
area to join say the regular police but

208
00:09:09,319 --> 00:09:13,089
not everyone is law and everything I

209
00:09:13,089 --> 00:09:15,319
went through a different way I just

210
00:09:15,319 --> 00:09:17,239
basically said hey you've got to hire me

211
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:19,069
out I just want do anything I don't know

212
00:09:19,069 --> 00:09:20,470
if that would necessarily work nowadays

213
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:24,769
I think it's possibly easier to go and

214
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:28,129
get known first and I think getting out

215
00:09:28,129 --> 00:09:30,699
there I mean with the likes of Twitter

216
00:09:30,699 --> 00:09:33,049
blogging vlogging there's so many

217
00:09:33,049 --> 00:09:34,699
platforms waiting more than when I

218
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:38,689
started out in 2004 to get your views

219
00:09:38,689 --> 00:09:41,420
out there and if you get known I think

220
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,819
there's probably more chance that if you

221
00:09:43,819 --> 00:09:45,860
would then throw in your name it might

222
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,379
be noticed and that goes for private and

223
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,989
public I guess yeah but isn't it true

224
00:09:50,989 --> 00:09:52,670
though you also have to have a deep

225
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,669
strong desire to be paid a pittance in

226
00:09:55,669 --> 00:09:58,999
comparison to what the private sector

227
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:02,899
yeah that's that's the payoff but it

228
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:05,540
didn't but it didn't bug me because I

229
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,980
really did feel like I was giving back

230
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,199
the community you know going to cool for

231
00:10:09,199 --> 00:10:11,480
my first time I mean at the time I was

232
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,850
so so nervous but looking back it's

233
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:16,309
fantastic experience I did feel at the

234
00:10:16,309 --> 00:10:18,529
time I'm doing something good especially

235
00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:21,470
when you're dealing with equal that have

236
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:25,369
committed vendors child offenses and you

237
00:10:25,369 --> 00:10:28,100
might be so nervous against a jury of 12

238
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:32,209
people who thinking you know what the

239
00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:34,279
hell's going on here and I get to go and

240
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:36,589
deliver that evidence for them to make

241
00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:39,199
up their minds that really is part of

242
00:10:39,199 --> 00:10:42,439
the system in the UK that when it works

243
00:10:42,439 --> 00:10:44,480
right obviously it doesn't always what

244
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,129
am i right it feels so didn't you go

245
00:10:46,129 --> 00:10:48,949
back classic get the donuts out you put

246
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:51,110
someone away for the right amount of

247
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,179
time or help towards that investigation

248
00:10:53,179 --> 00:10:55,759
it's a huge team effort that's amazing

249
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:58,279
and you don't necessarily get that in

250
00:10:58,279 --> 00:10:59,779
the private world there anyway the

251
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:02,759
program what 18 months but

252
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:05,709
you get that family feel the very few

253
00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:08,769
people leaves the cops and a peeping the

254
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:10,839
cops are saying why are you going well

255
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:12,459
it was what's going on you haven't done

256
00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:14,980
35 years this is odd because you don't

257
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,379
therefore it becomes a family and I love

258
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:21,519
that family feel that you get there care

259
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,360
about the cash

260
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,699
so it's interesting because we talked to

261
00:11:24,699 --> 00:11:26,529
a hacker fantastic and we've talked to a

262
00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:29,889
few other people about sort of law

263
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:33,519
enforcement and the challenges in law

264
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,639
enforcement yeah but there is certain

265
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:38,939
training that you get in law enforcement

266
00:11:38,939 --> 00:11:42,309
like digital forensics and intelligence

267
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:44,559
criminal intelligence that you really

268
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:47,139
can't get anywhere else as those skills

269
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:50,579
become very highly paid civilians most

270
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:54,369
yeah I've loved all my courses yeah

271
00:11:54,369 --> 00:11:56,259
that's absolutely right there's some

272
00:11:56,259 --> 00:11:58,629
really good training programs out there

273
00:11:58,629 --> 00:12:01,269
but if you look at some of them you can

274
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:05,679
do privately but there's the prices yeah

275
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:09,009
tight exams OSI end course is like five

276
00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:12,970
thousand yeah yeah yeah if you want that

277
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,049
you just put you hand up and say hey

278
00:12:14,049 --> 00:12:15,670
I've got an idea

279
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,290
and I'll get right what you're doing in

280
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,519
three weeks time you're going away for a

281
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:22,869
week and I love that yeah so I kept

282
00:12:22,869 --> 00:12:25,660
training as you can absolutely and they

283
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,429
are really heavy on I mean it not only

284
00:12:27,429 --> 00:12:29,230
that they are fantastic annual leave and

285
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,269
flexi time which is always a winner

286
00:12:31,269 --> 00:12:32,679
which you don't get in the pro well and

287
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:36,730
free bus routes right free or you pay

288
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,470
fifty quid and then you can go anywhere

289
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:47,619
right but I wouldn't ever always show my

290
00:12:47,619 --> 00:12:50,350
my identity cards if you're in some

291
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:58,720
restaurants because so we we've had a

292
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,860
few people aren't talking about

293
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,679
partnership between the police and the

294
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:04,629
private sector do you think that's

295
00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:09,369
improving I don't know I got asked this

296
00:13:09,369 --> 00:13:11,589
question the other day actually by a

297
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:14,439
regional cybercrime team and he was

298
00:13:14,439 --> 00:13:15,490
getting quite

299
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,619
stressed with the tech world who say

300
00:13:17,619 --> 00:13:19,149
come on you're all pretending that

301
00:13:19,149 --> 00:13:22,029
you're all into CSR let's all actually

302
00:13:22,029 --> 00:13:24,040
work together but we were discussing

303
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,170
that the other thing companies are there

304
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,360
to make money and people in positions

305
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,660
don't make their quota for whatever

306
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,259
length of time then they're going to

307
00:13:35,259 --> 00:13:37,809
possibly get moved on from not making it

308
00:13:37,809 --> 00:13:39,999
or at least better right even now gonna

309
00:13:39,999 --> 00:13:43,300
make X amount in this lap time it's not

310
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,369
the same in public world it's very

311
00:13:45,369 --> 00:13:48,240
difficult to to align those two together

312
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,790
the public and the private it's going to

313
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,619
be difficult to make them all work

314
00:13:53,619 --> 00:13:56,079
together you can get them out of meeting

315
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,050
that's fantastic but they've both got

316
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:01,179
different agendas and so it'll always

317
00:14:01,179 --> 00:14:03,579
have those those discrepancies and

318
00:14:03,579 --> 00:14:09,009
difficulties okay interesting some

319
00:14:09,009 --> 00:14:12,189
really interesting stuff it is there

320
00:14:12,189 --> 00:14:14,230
anything that we could do to help

321
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:17,949
perhaps with working with the police

322
00:14:17,949 --> 00:14:20,410
forces um

323
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:24,519
I guess these businesses they want to

324
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:26,829
hear fun stories and there's only so far

325
00:14:26,829 --> 00:14:29,799
you can go and talk about the police if

326
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:31,569
you were to go and give an interesting

327
00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:34,269
story and that's Betty where I like to

328
00:14:34,269 --> 00:14:36,819
go in when I do my talks now is go and

329
00:14:36,819 --> 00:14:40,329
give an easy to digest story that has a

330
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:43,059
message at the end and there are lot of

331
00:14:43,059 --> 00:14:44,350
guys that you've been speaking to today

332
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,059
there are so in fantastic you're doing

333
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:48,970
this yeah so with those people and I

334
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,769
still offer myself to the local police

335
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:53,049
force if they ever want someone else to

336
00:14:53,049 --> 00:14:55,480
go in and then that is helpful but if

337
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,119
they don't always have the experience of

338
00:14:58,119 --> 00:15:01,149
the prior world in what they're offering

339
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:02,920
yes I've got some great stories about

340
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,589
you know busting a murderer actually on

341
00:15:05,589 --> 00:15:07,929
that horse or a cleaning bonnet out of

342
00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:10,110
the back of the police car

343
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:14,430
that's always fun funniest story I can

344
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:18,260
never tell when I was given a harddrive

345
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,760
why she was a laptop it was kind of

346
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,870
blood and they said we've got a murder

347
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,459
we're pretty sure that this guy has done

348
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:29,279
it he's um he's been caught with her

349
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,730
with an axe or similar I think was but

350
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,230
can you get any evidence off this

351
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:36,600
computer just to add to it and I said

352
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,940
yeah and then it's bagged I get the guts

353
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:42,959
on I get the hard drive out and I

354
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,420
thought well I'll check the locks see if

355
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,540
it was turned on and I did so it was

356
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,800
turned on at the time of the initial

357
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,459
defense

358
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:52,800
I then realized he'd been on Google and

359
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,720
so I thought I wonder what he was

360
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:02,899
searching no good how do I get rid of

361
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:16,649
obviously we had and there's but you

362
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:19,019
know and it's funny because in the US

363
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,820
justice system or a Canadian justice

364
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,339
system you you'd be able to plead out on

365
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,529
that kind of evidence right like you

366
00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:27,269
wouldn't even end up probably going to

367
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:29,579
trial but in the UK it's a bit different

368
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:32,870
right there's no sort of judicial

369
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:36,870
negotiation yeah it's that correct well

370
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:40,890
it depends they can go no comment right

371
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:43,320
way up to this trial so then you have to

372
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,750
go with the trial bit at any moment if

373
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,660
they say guilty yeah and then they lose

374
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:52,230
some time off their jail time so if you

375
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,820
said guilty straight away it's usually

376
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,100
around thirty percent thirty percent off

377
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,149
your visa clear Brian well who would be

378
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:01,980
the person that would be pleading on our

379
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:10,500
behalf if you so sure after all the

380
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,770
initial interviews between them and up

381
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:14,970
to the trial

382
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,619
you usually get around ten percent off

383
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,750
but it's all to do with time everyone's

384
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,059
spent on the case and then if they

385
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:23,128
still saying that they are completely

386
00:17:23,128 --> 00:17:24,990
innocent and then the trial goes ahead

387
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:29,549
then that it has to but it depends on

388
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:32,299
whether I'm called for court back then

389
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:34,379
with the evidence because I always give

390
00:17:34,379 --> 00:17:36,480
the evidence to the case and they would

391
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,309
read through it and it would be up to

392
00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:41,879
the defense team to decide if usually if

393
00:17:41,879 --> 00:17:43,950
they want me to go and present it

394
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,600
sometimes they're looking for the

395
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,700
discrepancies or mistakes I may have

396
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,820
made they have black yeah I mean the

397
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,379
smallest of things I got caught up once

398
00:17:52,379 --> 00:17:54,330
because I said there it was out of five

399
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:57,269
pages but but it was only out for and

400
00:17:57,269 --> 00:17:59,129
they'll try and pick you out on those

401
00:17:59,129 --> 00:18:01,799
little bits and say no if you can't add

402
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:04,259
to five then can you really do digital

403
00:18:04,259 --> 00:18:06,360
forensics I mean it's a good question

404
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,580
but this is the kind of thing that would

405
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,470
go on and court but I can access like

406
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:13,679
theater so there is this huge hack that

407
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,850
hit one of the primary digital forensics

408
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:21,230
firms that the police had outsourced to

409
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,990
how devastating is that for

410
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:27,720
investigations well yeah you can imagine

411
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,059
the defense team would just be laughing

412
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:33,149
that up they would be trying to find out

413
00:18:33,149 --> 00:18:35,460
if their evidence has been outsourced to

414
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,230
that said company right and if it had

415
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:41,460
they would be high-fiving their client

416
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:44,999
and saying I think we got this so yeah I

417
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:46,619
wouldn't want to be working in their

418
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:47,369
company at that time

419
00:18:47,369 --> 00:18:50,460
for that just for those who aren't aware

420
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,919
what that was there was a third party

421
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:55,289
contractor where evidence was sent to

422
00:18:55,289 --> 00:18:58,499
their hair the ransomware text so that's

423
00:18:58,499 --> 00:19:00,210
obviously not good because one of the

424
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:02,369
things touted against that is hey

425
00:19:02,369 --> 00:19:04,440
someone changed these files so how can

426
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,850
we guarantee that the evidence

427
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,610
absolutely yeah

428
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:10,200
yeah don't look for anything to get

429
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,549
about I mean that's quite big you know

430
00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:12,809
they've got to do this loop to the jury

431
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:13,980
and this is what they would do because

432
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,100
it's theater and it's the jury and I

433
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,710
roll and say mmm Wow look what happened

434
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,899
over there and it gets those people just

435
00:19:21,899 --> 00:19:26,610
thinking and it's all about yeah beyond

436
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:28,889
reasonable doubt to get that person

437
00:19:28,889 --> 00:19:32,279
prosecuted right cool listen Jake really

438
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:33,210
