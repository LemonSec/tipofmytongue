1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,429
I am indeed right welcome Scott

2
00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:03,959

correctly welcome to Buick on 25 thanks

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,330
for joining us so Scott it was a quick

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,099
favor and tell us who you are what you

6
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:17,520
do basically I sum all of us have a name

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,490
Scott I do briefly kind of vaguely

8
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,070
enforce a key base stuff I tend to spend

9
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,140
a lot of my time doing public talks I

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,480
work occasionally before enforcement I'm

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,390
all that to a dramatic end in February

12
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,200
and I do some education pieces which is

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,460
always fun Anna show to people on

14
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,020
Twitter that's probably where people

15
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,390
know me mostly from okay but you've got

16
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,829
the spirit of Christmas Scott because

17
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:42,809
you've got a festive hat on your avatar

18
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:45,390
I have I even switched on early this

19
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,930
year I think more people should do this

20
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,460
it took me a while to encourage the bear

21
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,289
farmers to do it so far only Ian's

22
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:55,289
managed it with a horrible monster from

23
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:59,640
your worst nightmares with Santa it's

24
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,719
the thought that counts

25
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,699
more people in Santa hats that's behind

26
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:04,860
agreed just to take you back a couple of

27
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,530
minutes so a couple of seconds you said

28
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,909
you worked with law enforcement

29
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:10,950
up until February this year when it came

30
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,890
to a dramatic end could is there

31
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,930
anything you tell us about that in an

32
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,250
indictment well that's the question

33
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,619
really yeah oh no absolutely there's

34
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:22,470
there's someone said on the desk or the

35
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,150
other day you know he is the drummer

36
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,970
around this thing and basically the idea

37
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,710
was we were part of a volunteer

38
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,200
organization called C SUV and the idea

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,689
was to bring technology and to policing

40
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:36,180
and train of data cuz policing so far

41
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,210
behind it's not even funny anymore

42
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,979
the real losers over this are the

43
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:42,360
general public we've seen it all the

44
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,110
time with a you know big law enforcement

45
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,610
Twitter account saying hey you know look

46
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,229
out for the green padlock and you're

47
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:52,110
sitting there going no that's not how it

48
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,490
works and we have to try and educate

49
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,590
them and it took a long time to try and

50
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,329
get into law enforcement and say hey you

51
00:01:57,329 --> 00:01:58,439
know you'd ever know the wrong advice

52
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,210
here it's actually making people less

53
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,229
safe as a result can we fix that and we

54
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:06,619
did a good job for a couple years until

55
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:09,508
basically we got funding and then when

56
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:11,400
we got funding non-technical managers

57
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,250
took over get paid 600

58
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,670
ready to literally run out of passwords

59
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,830
quote-unquote currents running program

60
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:21,350
which was quite as it's sad really

61
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,630
because the real losers here are the

62
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,160
people who are part of the program we

63
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,470
had some amazing folks like amazing from

64
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,380
17-year old students right up till a 60

65
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,390
year old police chief's who just wanted

66
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:35,120
to do some good work we lost all that in

67
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,490
a heartbeat because people just didn't

68
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,700
get it

69
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,459
anything that we could try to do as a

70
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:47,030
community to try bring that back I mean

71
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,370
ultimately I just said that it's the

72
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,910
general public that being impacted so as

73
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,940
a community what can we do tell

74
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,930
absolutely just just keep doing what

75
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:58,760
we're doing we seem to be great at

76
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,560
publishing articles and stuff I think

77
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,600
some of the we spoke about it earlier

78
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,489
some of the scare mongering that can it

79
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:06,470
goes on another click BT stuff yeah

80
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,820
that's that's good forgetting the kind

81
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,800
of public's interest to click on an

82
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,390
article and go here should be really

83
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,310
using a password manager hey have I been

84
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,170
pawned is actually safe and you know

85
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,630
it's not a scam and they're just kind of

86
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,670
educating people gonna say hey have you

87
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,500
seen this this is a new thing that's out

88
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,260
there and literally two weeks ago I was

89
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,959
in the Netherlands demonstrating

90
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:30,200
extortion tool which is basically just a

91
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,170
web or you can control and join any

92
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,330
video chat and basically make people on

93
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:36,860
the other end believe that person's real

94
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:40,130
and the law process will use it and

95
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:43,070
basically sextortion to extort a victim

96
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,920
and sadly a lot of people don't realize

97
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,350
that that is possible or what it looks

98
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:51,200
like and I put something together just

99
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,970
to kinda demonstrates it so that people

100
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,040
go that's what it looks like because you

101
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,269
guys know what it's like you speak to

102
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:57,739
non-technical person you say right

103
00:03:57,739 --> 00:03:59,930
here's their SSL works here's how this

104
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:00,290
works

105
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,209
it was interests within 10 seconds yeah

106
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:03,769
but if you show them something nice and

107
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:06,049
shiny that's good you know someone on

108
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:08,510
camera doing something holy crap they

109
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,340
sit there and go oh that's what it looks

110
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,860
like I know you understand this so just

111
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,209
make it simple for people and just

112
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:16,220
simplify boats and stuff and put it out

113
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,228
there and to say hey this is what it

114
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:20,238
kind of looks like this is what you need

115
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,160
to protect against and I think that

116
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,280
would work

117
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,190
because I mean do you think we as an

118
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,080
industry focus too much like you really

119
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,910
mentioned that yes sir so focus too much

120
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,580
on the technical details rather then hey

121
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,230
this is what's how it's going to affect

122
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:37,560
you I think yeah kind of I think those

123
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,210
chats are really really important I

124
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,010
think it's worthwhile for the general

125
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,900
public to see that even we think you

126
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,160
just mentioned there would be a farmer's

127
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,630
fight amongst ourselves all the time

128
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,490
that's good because that means that

129
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,530
people care about what decisions are

130
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:50,940
making and they're making sure that

131
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,220
there's about transparency or you know

132
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,660
if you say to someone here really want

133
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,250
to do that saying and you say no I don't

134
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,140
agree with that okay and just say I

135
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,330
don't it means you're invested in the

136
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,800
original decision in the first place I

137
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,900
think we need all of that but for the

138
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,000
general public I think we need to try

139
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,220
and make it a bit more accessible to

140
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,960
them and I don't know quite how we can

141
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,700
do that I think just chat with them and

142
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,380
saying hey you know what would you want

143
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,960
over this because the mimouna things I

144
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,730
speak to members of the public and they

145
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,440
say you know I'm terrified I don't even

146
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,690
want it on on that laptop anymore that

147
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,510
side we need to move into where you know

148
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,760
they can feel safe to use technology

149
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,560
with the overcomplicating that by going

150
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,150
hey you know make sure you've got your

151
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:33,510
SSL stuff updated and SSSs and download

152
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,430
all patches but a stone can be hacked in

153
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,890
this you know we tend to scare monger a

154
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,060
little bit sometimes that's good

155
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,260
sometimes that's bad

156
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,060
I want to I want to go back to that

157
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,460
issue of scared to turn the laptop on

158
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,190
because more and more banking and

159
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,410
government services are only really

160
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:52,320
accessible via a computer device you

161
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,600
know and and that has a chilling sort of

162
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,360
a chilling consequence for the

163
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,820
accessibility of these services right

164
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,380
through it through the computer if the

165
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,390
computer can't be trusted then the

166
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:09,419
services can't be trusted and then I

167
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:12,979
think the other thing too is it really i

168
00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:16,290
if the internet is truly you know a very

169
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:20,130
scary proposition for people they they

170
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,260
end up being almost a second-class

171
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,020
citizen you know yeah yeah no no I

172
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,300
totally get that and so there was there

173
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,530
was a few conversations I had with

174
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,630
someone recently where was it was

175
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,800
basically we we spent about an hour

176
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,009
about banks we just spent up about an

177
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:38,050
hour bitching about banking systems and

178
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,599
how just crappy where and you know if

179
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:42,159
you go into any bank I wouldn't name

180
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:44,319
them their names but any modern corn

181
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,690
core traditional bank if you go in the

182
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:49,419
website it's crap and you spent 45

183
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:51,069
minutes trying to log in you have to get

184
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:52,900
a card reader you need to do a bunch of

185
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,430
other stuff that's why all the digital

186
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,780
challenger balanced with really cool

187
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,690
because they can get it but again you

188
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,370
know there's no branches for that so it

189
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,879
kind of cut so that's massive section of

190
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:05,110
elderly people people are not able to

191
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:07,419
use this technology and not we for

192
00:07:07,419 --> 00:07:09,009
whatever reason whether they disagree

193
00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:10,300
with that well they're physically unable

194
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,599
it does kind of almost can segregate

195
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,370
them off and then we leave those people

196
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,169
behind I think you know modern buying

197
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:19,449
the Challenger banks are thinking about

198
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:20,080
those people

199
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,580
the modern banks are just kind of

200
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,039
steaming forwards with the really shitty

201
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:27,129
service really crappy website really

202
00:07:27,129 --> 00:07:29,050
crappy things that just don't really

203
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,819
work properly and they just go yeah well

204
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:32,500
that's just modern technology you just

205
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,539
have to deal with it no that's not quite

206
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:36,159
how it works you know we need to get

207
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:38,889
better at that I can see the chance

208
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:41,680
mentioning squirrels constantly this is

209
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,000
awesome do you know anything about the

210
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,750
squirrels so for people that don't know

211
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,599
and I have a brief obsession with

212
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:54,940
squirrels if you check my Twitter there

213
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:58,180
is literally about 5% and full site

214
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,029
content and 95% are just pictures of my

215
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:03,129
squirrel basically and that's not a

216
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:06,069
euphemism no when you say a brief

217
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:10,990
obsession yeah well that's a brief yeah

218
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,360
that was just total [ __ ] a some very

219
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,550
good egg obsession it's a big obsession

220
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,199
I love squirrels no do you love them

221
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,719
from the InfoSec perspective ie that a

222
00:08:19,719 --> 00:08:22,479
lot of you know event

223
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,069
cybersecurity events have been

224
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:27,340
attributed to the sacrifice of a

225
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:27,909
squirrel

226
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:31,029
yes and so if you people aren't familiar

227
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:33,219
if you go to thank if sine bar square

228
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:36,010
one calm and it tracks all the major

229
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,010
cyber attacks are being basically

230
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,870
rounded or attributed to squirrels or

231
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,208
bats I think is an 11 and Badgers on

232
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:46,420
Vegas and raccoons as well this is a

233
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,779
thing and if you do read up on I think

234
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,180
what you pedia there's an article based

235
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,160
girls and there as a section of it cyber

236
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,399
attacks but they took down a stack twice

237
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,019
so I think this is a serious problem we

238
00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:01,240
need to consider square rooms to be the

239
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,910
biggest threat to n for second security

240
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,790
we've never only it's the Iranians girls

241
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:10,930
only nuclear North Koreans Bruce well

242
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:13,449
the North Koreans grows only in to work

243
00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:16,529
in the northern part of the states

244
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:22,449
advanced persistent mammals so I'm

245
00:09:22,449 --> 00:09:24,220
assuming without going away in Google

246
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,720
and it which I'm gonna do afterwards

247
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,810
yeah the the squirrel problem stems from

248
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,209
them what eating through cables data

249
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:33,670
cables power cables or are they actually

250
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,860
doing SE and brave breaking a data

251
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:41,589
centers they prove not in the classes

252
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:43,360
they're gonna breaking in through the

253
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,860
bite don't know they're literally just

254
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,750
chewed through cables Wow which is

255
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,519
fantastic because that kind of

256
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:50,019
highlights like a threat model and no

257
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:52,209
one anticipated learn you know we're

258
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:54,430
always super super concerned and it kind

259
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,560
of hurts by to public protection

260
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,380
we're always super concerned about

261
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,550
serious threats but we never consider

262
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,920
the simple stuff well we do but you know

263
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,420
we don't intend to pass all into the

264
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,000
public I've been in lectures with some

265
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,660
amazing amazing young people student and

266
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,399
I've said to them here's a credit card

267
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,529
with fifty thousand pounds on it going

268
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:16,990
build me the best security system you

269
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,130
can and they're always coming up with

270
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:21,040
these amazing amazing ideas which is

271
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,199
great and then you go yeah but you know

272
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:24,190
I can just walk out there with a

273
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,040
baseball bat and Tom that machine off

274
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,050
just see their face go oh [ __ ] yeah

275
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:31,930
that's a big problem you're like we

276
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,339
should be thinking about the simplistic

277
00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:35,949
one yes just let's go back to a point

278
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:39,819
you made earlier Scott about the arguing

279
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:41,890
within the industry and people you know

280
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,750
not seeing eye to eye on topics such as

281
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,060
SSL and password management and all that

282
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,709
kind of stuff you know it's something

283
00:10:47,709 --> 00:10:49,180
we've talked about at the bear farmers

284
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,050
and it's something I'm personally

285
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,940
interested in doing in the next twelve

286
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,680
months is is kind of not necessarily

287
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,630
doing much in the way of intersect

288
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,850
conferences mmm and that kind of stuff

289
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:58,950
because

290
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,600
is a bubble and we are kind of preaching

291
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,060
to the converted a lot of the time yes

292
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,470
that there are people that want to argue

293
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:07,980
for the sake of it whatever but in order

294
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,870
to break out of the industry and into

295
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,390
the world then you've got to start doing

296
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,790
the kind of things that that Jess and

297
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,070
FCU doing and that's taking it into

298
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,390
schools yeah

299
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,010
places like that I mean to community

300
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,950
groups and educating people on not what

301
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,600
SSL is because who gives a [ __ ] about

302
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,260
that right yeah about not what what's

303
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,610
the green padlock all about because as

304
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:30,990
we well know the green padlock has

305
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,780
become a thing of the past anyway but

306
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,310
about the concepts of staying safe

307
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:37,560
online well that's something I actually

308
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,530
do is I go schools quite a bit and I I

309
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:43,320
do give basically lectures to every year

310
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,570
group and some stuff that I talked about

311
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,790
as I always started with the same

312
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,950
statement and it's I remember being at

313
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,410
school and this was I was probably

314
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:53,940
around a fifth year so it was probably

315
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:58,350
around Oh 16 16 years old and I remember

316
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,840
that neighborhood watch Scotland came to

317
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,850
our school and necesitan where mobile

318
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:05,130
phones just came out and he said oh we

319
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,810
don't really understand these things but

320
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,370
we hear that there's some creepy men

321
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,440
that came for new and stuff so don't use

322
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,300
a mobile phone and that was a whole

323
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,640
safety talk about mobile phones and last

324
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,920
life Romero

325
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,770
yeah and I always go into schools

326
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,900
thinking hey look you know I come from

327
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,880
this industry I know the rest I know the

328
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,370
benefits but here's all the ways that I

329
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,920
[ __ ] up through the years okay here's

330
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,140
all the stupid [ __ ] I've done I've put

331
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,870
pictures of me setting on top of TV

332
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:37,170
studios saying the week that was my

333
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:39,510
profile picture on facebook for a year

334
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:42,420
the week that a TV show I was doing with

335
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,700
that very TV company when everyone here

336
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,810
and I got a call from the director

337
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:49,020
saying you better remove that no yeah

338
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,610
that was a fun time but I'm sure that

339
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,590
took us to go look you know you go I

340
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,390
understand

341
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:57,000
safety security it's all fun but I'm not

342
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,580
here telling you what to do and I'm you

343
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,590
know I'm perfect you know I screw up all

344
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,270
the time and tweet my location

345
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,010
constantly especially if I'm a squirrel

346
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:08,280
Park I'm going to tweet my location you

347
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,840
know and it's good to get through to

348
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,649
kids and young people in

349
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:13,930
you know here's what to do in terms of

350
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,819
safety and at the end you always get

351
00:13:15,819 --> 00:13:18,610
people coming up going hey so I have

352
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,800
this weird message and I'm not sure who

353
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,899
to go to and you're like well why

354
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:24,220
haven't you spoken to parents or

355
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,300
teachers I'm like because they just

356
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,800
don't get it they don't understand

357
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,540
technology they're like what snapchat no

358
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,550
I don't use a banner I think that's

359
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,329
really silent

360
00:13:31,329 --> 00:13:33,279
yeah agreed so it's just about doing the

361
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,589
right things and knowing what your risk

362
00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:39,009
profile is and I think people everybody

363
00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:41,199
has a different risk profile you know

364
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,179
talk about the chances of you being

365
00:13:43,179 --> 00:13:46,420
hacked as an individual or potentially

366
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,550
different than if you're in information

367
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,559
security professional or a furious admin

368
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:51,939
that works in a business or if you're a

369
00:13:51,939 --> 00:13:53,829
politician you know he's got a different

370
00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:55,869
risk profile at the end of the day yeah

371
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:58,899
and also everyone's got a different

372
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:02,679
appetite for risk absolutely yeah yeah

373
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:05,230
and it's interesting somebody did know

374
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,879
I'm gonna talk about the students again

375
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,490
when you speak to some of the students

376
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,059
it's someone that we've actually

377
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:11,379
approached me when I'm late look you

378
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:13,300
know just be very aware that you know

379
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,949
your data's out there and stuff and then

380
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:16,209
you come up to you and say hey I've

381
00:14:16,209 --> 00:14:17,769
heard that you know people are selling

382
00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:20,110
data in the dark web okay fair enough

383
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,329
I'm not really keen on this concept but

384
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:24,999
go for it and say can we make some money

385
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:27,309
or that can I sell my own data and

386
00:14:27,309 --> 00:14:29,139
that's something I never considered that

387
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:30,819
someone wanted to actively

388
00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:32,769
basically dolts himself to make a bit of

389
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:35,139
money so it's quite interesting to see

390
00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:37,389
these kids think about security a wee

391
00:14:37,389 --> 00:14:41,529
bit differently I don't care that my

392
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:42,730
shirts over there it's going to be out

393
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,529
there eventually so that makes the money

394
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:47,139
off it it's funny I I had a similar

395
00:14:47,139 --> 00:14:49,839
experience I went to a local school that

396
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,220
we do a little bit of work experience

397
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,720
stuff with and all that kind of thing

398
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,269
and I went with a colleague who's our

399
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,279
network design network engineering

400
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,009
manager and he did a talk about our core

401
00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:01,509
network and all this kind of stuff and

402
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:04,720
then I stood up introduced himself and

403
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,999
said oh yeah I made a mistake it was

404
00:15:06,999 --> 00:15:09,040
fundamentally schoolboy error in a

405
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,290
school and said hi my name is Mike and

406
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:11,970
I'm a hacker

407
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:14,860
yeah which was a [ __ ] thing to do I

408
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,959
thought it'd just impress the kids and

409
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,480
it did the problem was arms went up in

410
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,370
the air immediately all these

411
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:23,740
it was all boys by way of said can you

412
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:27,100
show me out hat the maid oh that was the

413
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,480
immediate reaction to that and I said

414
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,830
well I couldn't do but then that would

415
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:33,070
be breaking the law but yeah that was

416
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,660
the prevailing attitude I think with a

417
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,279
lot of young kids is that it is all

418
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:38,080
hockey hockey and breaking into stuff

419
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,080
and getting your exes Facebook account

420
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,279
and all that kind of stuff there's

421
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:43,690
nothing to do with that it's all about

422
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:47,110
preserving your own situation and making

423
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,640
things better for everybody else that's

424
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,560
where I said let's make things better

425
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,080
for everybody and you know let's I know

426
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:57,160
we have a drama channel but later

427
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,560
oh yeah that's basically the drama

428
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,300
channel let's let's stop that I mean

429
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,800
it's good to have arguments is good to

430
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,750
follow with people because you're it

431
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,070
means that you're thinking about things

432
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,930
and you're actually going hey is this

433
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,250
the right thing that we're doing but

434
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,140
let's actively like work together as a

435
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,760
community this is a great community in

436
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,010
yeah life's pretty severe are you

437
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:17,080
suggesting that we refrain from personal

438
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,990
attacks no no it's a little all right

439
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:22,210
notice all please direct all yours over

440
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:26,470
the ly goodness all right Scott so give

441
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,700
us a flavor of some of the stuff you're

442
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,290
gonna be doing in the next 12 months

443
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:31,870
okay I'm more like just basically more

444
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:34,050
lectures trying to build more education

445
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:38,170
based talks I will be doing letters e

446
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:40,360
universes some undergrad stuff also in

447
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,150
schools I'm gonna still be pushing away

448
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:45,370
at the whole can chopping away there

449
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,110
were law enforcement blog to try and go

450
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,660
hey you know here's here's what that

451
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,490
says here's how it works here's how you

452
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:54,130
can explain it to the public although I

453
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,900
don't have the official backing of

454
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,550
anybody no I don't really care I'm still

455
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,400
gonna do it it makes me feel good so and

456
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,320
people are very very receptive to that

457
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,790
within the law enforcement community so

458
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,410
I'm absolutely pushing that forward I

459
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:06,910
say from that probably just share

460
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,260
posting and taking pictures of squirrels

461
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:11,559
that's my dad it's fast tech excellent

462
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:14,290
stuff excellent and anybody else got a

463
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:18,429
question for Scott we've got a comment

464
00:17:18,429 --> 00:17:21,910
which has come on the twitch suddenly

465
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,650
said Scott your thoughts are interesting

466
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:27,040
and they're inspired so that's that

467
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,160
person is clearly drunk

468
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,760
it is 2:30 so it is well past the

469
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,340
traditional start time of UK beverages

470
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,280
yeah another questions coming from from

471
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,350
Emily Overton who was a guest on earlier

472
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,480
on and her question is what is your

473
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,910
favorite name for a squirrel squiggle

474
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:50,730
yeah I know I talk like a child is it

475
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,010
helicopter yeah I can't stop myself

476
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:55,020
seeing Haley talk time said a helicopter

477
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,330
I told like a child it should be very

478
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,340
obvious so when it's your InfoSec

479
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,830
children's book featuring its grill

480
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,140
squarely the squirrel it's great little

481
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:07,290
story that's actually a great idea I

482
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:08,940
never thought of it I should bring him

483
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,770
in for sake book but it's squiggly the

484
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:13,980
squirrel you absolutely shed for

485
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,720
children Eden you just invented an

486
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:21,090
industry not really no no I I just took

487
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:23,520
out the domain name though no horse

488
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,100
corral so I watch it I'll sell it to you

489
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,220
it's fine because the bear farmers are

490
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,370
quite a benevolent yeah yeah and so for

491
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:34,890
