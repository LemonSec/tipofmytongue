happy Saturday yeah forget for us it's

6
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:22,520
only a seven o'clock ish around here so

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,410
so what about sorry up the east side of

8
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:28,029
the u.s. yam in a Brooklyn New York so I

9
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:31,789
can think of fantastic well welcome

along thank you

11
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,989
I thought if you've been listening in

12
00:00:35,989 --> 00:00:37,429
but it's kind of been a little bit free

13
00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:39,229
wheeling and people have been talking

14
00:00:39,229 --> 00:00:40,760
about what they want to speak about and

15
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,530
we've kind of asked a few questions and

16
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,289
it's but generally I'm pretty relaxed

17
00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:49,460
uh-huh so what do you have for us what

18
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,690
we'd like to speak about I really didn't

19
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:55,489
actually think about that too hard

20
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:58,789
before I also logged on just now woody

21
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:00,499

25
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,140
bottle of sake oh yeah I think I think

26
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,700
you might be on the wrong channel or

27
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:25,210
Laureate Ellen

28
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,310
properly since around like 2003 2004

29
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,720
started out working in the government

30
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,420
that was a little weird writing no dates

31
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,610
for the military and then just had to

32
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,080
have pivoted back into application

33
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,960
security I was a web developer to pay

34
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,380
the bills when I was in university so

35
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:55,190
and now I I'm basically just sort of a

36
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,050
free range application security

37
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,780
consultant and I also teach application

38
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:05,770
security at NYU Wow at night so

39
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:08,030
corrupting the youth

40
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,310
the degeneration of security

41
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,120
practitioners that will be probably

42
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,820
coming out and asking for jobs and I

43
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,190
think I think back in a day you were

44
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,140
probably one of the first people that I

45
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,890
started following on InfoSec Twitter and

46
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,680
I was always amazed at your kindness and

47
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,370
just how much you do seem to care about

48
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:34,370
the community but you know we've been

49
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,990
talking a lot one of the themes that

50
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,230
we've had this evening was really around

51
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,900
handling toxicity and and you've been

52
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,870
with Twitter since almost Twitter began

53
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,420
right yeah yeah like it's it's been a

54
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,780
it's been like 10 years right yeah so is

55
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:54,740
it is it I bought them less [ __ ] show of

56
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:58,760
awfulness or proving where what's your

57
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,080
take on it because you have a unique

58
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,600
perspective because of the length of

59
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,910
time you've been part of this online

60
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:08,060
community I I think I think it's gotten

61
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,760
a lot better where people are and I

62
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,500
don't like to use the term woke so I'm

63
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,910
going to use it and like scare quotes

64
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:16,850
you can't see me doing the hand gesture

65
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:23,540
oh we could see it yeah I think I think

66
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:29,510
now people are much less afraid to you

67
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,540
know call out toxic behavior and you

68
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,959
know say like like dude your girl your

69
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:39,260
you're being a douchebag like cut it out

70
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,110
we're like back when I first joined it

71
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,510
was it was so like 4chan was like still

72
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,340
a big thing like everybody was like oh

73
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,480
I'm a troll look at Marilyn you know and

74
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,290
just being controversial for

75
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:57,200
controversial say sake my mom always had

76
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,390
this kind of saying like you know

77
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,489
they're they're just getting negative

78
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:05,930
attention but negative attention is

79
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,989
still attention where now people kind of

80
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:11,480
realized that you know the stuff that

81
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,160
you say online can come back and bite

82
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,910
you in the ass later and I also think

83
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,798
that you know like I said before people

84
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,389
are a little bit

85
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:25,439
less afraid to be like you can't act

86
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:27,330
like that towards other people like yeah

87
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,729
yes it's the Internet but we're all

88
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:31,439
still there's still like a human behind

89
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:34,409
the keyboard and stopping the pile of

90
00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:36,090
[ __ ]

91
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,669
and and I think one of the reasons why

92
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:41,819
I've been a little bit more resilient to

93
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:43,979
it it's like I'm a [ __ ] New York like

94
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:48,389
okay good point if you like if you

95
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:50,129
actually likes it that like New Yorkers

96
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:51,960
are you know they get a reputation for

97
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,180
being you know hard around the edges and

98
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,719
you know sort of [ __ ] but like if

99
00:04:57,719 --> 00:04:59,340
you meet a New Yorker like you ask him

100
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,930
for directions they're usually more than

101
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,219
happy to help you they love to show

102
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:03,629
knowledge the city give you

103
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:06,240
recommendations good places to go like

104
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,009
if you get sick on the subway somebody

105
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:10,199
will probably come and come rush right

106
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:12,870
over to help you I remember one time I

107
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,069
saw like a guy he got gored by a bike so

108
00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:19,199
like a guy he well he was on a bike and

109
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,240
like somebody swung at the car door and

110
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,009
he got clipped by it he fell down in the

111
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:24,599
road like three people just ran over

112
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:26,879
right away to help them like and and

113
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:28,939
that's sort of the thing I think with

114
00:05:28,939 --> 00:05:32,580
InfoSec twitter is that like it's sort

115
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,969
of like being a New Yorker in New York

116
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:41,430
City is that you know like you see you

117
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,960
see the hard edges miss but when you

118
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,879
dive deeper you understand that you know

119
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:47,879
people are gonna you know pick that you

120
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:50,279
know bruised and dirty biker off the

121
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:53,520
road and I think people I think people

122
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,379
are starting to learn that being

123
00:05:55,379 --> 00:05:57,449
compassionate and being nice it's not a

124
00:05:57,449 --> 00:05:59,370
moral failing and it's not a sign of

125
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,919
weakness it's another thing because like

126
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,050
I mean I understand you know like I was

127
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,479
a hacker back in the late 90s yeah

128
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,029
everybody was you know messing up

129
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:11,789
everybody else's stuff and you know just

130
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:15,360
you know for the lols in in the early

131
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,330
2000s and whatnot if you know like okay

132
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,339
it's cool to be edgy and whatnot but

133
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:24,000
it's um I think at the end of the day

134
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,800
you're gonna go home and lay in your bed

135
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,509
and you're gonna be like he'll go to pat

136
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:29,279
yourself on the back for being like too

137
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:31,740
edgy like being an edge lord I mean I'd

138
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,039
rather go to bed

139
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,900
I was a nice person and maybe I helped

140
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,319
somebody up yeah look I love that

141
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:40,119
reference new being a New Yorker I've

142
00:06:40,119 --> 00:06:45,839
been in New York that's where hackers

143
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:53,830
yeah in my experience I mean up in New

144
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,770
York and I've been to London and in New

145
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,839
York I found the New Yorkers to be some

146
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:00,460
of the warmest people I've ever met one

147
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:04,509
of the coldest cities in London I found

148
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:07,240
it to be some of the coldest people one

149
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:14,889
of the warmest city you do get with

150
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:19,680
pragmatism in your average New Yorker

151
00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:23,319
yeah I mean that like the reason why New

152
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:25,809
Yorkers are sort of reserved and because

153
00:07:25,809 --> 00:07:27,789
we're like crammed into tiny boxes like

154
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:30,039
we live in tiny tiny little apartments

155
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:33,550
we get on a tiny little subway train to

156
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,169
go to work and then we sit in a tiny

157
00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:37,870
little office so like all of our time is

158
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,270
like being like basically elbow to elbow

159
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,069
with other people so we're just like we

160
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:43,419
don't want to [ __ ] deal with people

161
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:45,490
but we have to we're nice people and

162
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:47,259
that's the sort of the Internet as well

163
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:50,949
as like you get inundated with hot tapes

164
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:54,759
and whatever but you know when something

165
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:58,509
comes out like I remember you know I've

166
00:07:58,509 --> 00:08:00,249
seen a lot of people who have had you

167
00:08:00,249 --> 00:08:02,559
know financial problems or mental health

168
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:06,099
problems or whatever you know problems

169
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:07,719
getting their career on track and people

170
00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:10,599
rally for that like once they see

171
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:11,620
something and they're like I'm gonna

172
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,719
help you and I think that's great you

173
00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:15,490
know like for the most part we we make

174
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,240
snarky jokes

175
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:22,059
I probably way guilty of that the nice

176
00:08:22,059 --> 00:08:24,099
[ __ ] ought to be but you know like when

177
00:08:24,099 --> 00:08:28,180
somebody needs up we I've really seen

178
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,959
that in both the DEF CON community and

179
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:35,229
the hacker communities but I also note

180
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:36,940
that the fact that there are an awful

181
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,818
lot of ex-military and even you know

182
00:08:39,818 --> 00:08:42,760
current military reserve members in our

183
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,450
information security community

184
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,970
do you think folks struggle sometimes

185
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:51,779
with especially the military community

186
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:54,380
on top of information security

187
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,630
communicating to businesses do you find

188
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,120
that the communication is maybe one of

189
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,449
our key problems I wouldn't say that's

190
00:09:03,449 --> 00:09:05,490
something that's unique to you know

191
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,920
ex-military people I know like I worked

192
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,810
for the United States Army for

193
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,389
two-and-a-half years and it is the

194
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:14,610
mindset is a lot different when you go

195
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,610
into you know private sector like I work

196
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:19,290
for a lot of different financial

197
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,810
companies and you really have to you

198
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,040
know like you don't have a guaranteed

199
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,829
budget you know you have to make a case

200
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:28,290
for yes this is costing you money but

201
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,699
it's going to keep you off of the front

202
00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:31,350
page of The Wall Street Journal kind of

203
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:34,949
backtick so it's it's just a different

204
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:38,760
kind of scary from military to you know

205
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,279
finance or any other private private

206
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,470
sector job where military you're like if

207
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,839
we don't fix these bugs you know war

208
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,389
fighters are going to die whereas it's

209
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:50,370
like if we don't fix these bugs your

210
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,930
socks are gonna take tanked it you're

211
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,970
gonna be eaten SpaghettiOs cold atom

212
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:57,240
[ __ ] right right two different levels of

213
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,810
yeah yeah so just no truth to the rumor

214
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:03,269
that Code Red and nimda were we're

215
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,660
actually yours you didn't okay wait

216
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:14,610
there's a rumor been like a rumor about

217
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:18,870
me like like that so I mean if there was

218
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,940
I probably wouldn't even be mad I'd be

219
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:30,390
like okay I've got a question for you so

220
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:33,269
I do up SEC and the clues probably in my

221
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:38,180
handle and I know sure you're a guy but

222
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,690
[Laughter]

223
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:44,819
yeah we all we all do and sure right

224
00:10:44,819 --> 00:10:46,620
who's a fellow member of the bear

225
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,600
farmers he he does application security

226
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,550
as well now the question is in in the

227
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,290
world of application security we're all

228
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:58,500
kind of conditioned to follow along the

229
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,310
OWASP top

230
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:03,029
kind of stuff and that kind of is

231
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,860
well let's believe that reflects the

232
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,960
modern threats and trends and

233
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,130
vulnerabilities that exist and

234
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,800
application security but I actually

235
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,710
really only see one major problem and

236
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:16,170
that major problem is third party

237
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:20,430
compromised in terms of JavaScript's

238
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,170
that you're consuming upstream in your

239
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:24,060
application kind of stuff so the

240
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,740
question really is what are you seeing

241
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,230
is that just what I see reflect what you

242
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,710
see or the things aren't missing so you

243
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:34,350
know you do see I still see cross right

244
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:37,710
request forgery I still see sequel

245
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:41,640
injection so I you know POS top 10 is

246
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,060
still I'd say valid for the most part

247
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,850
because and it you know like it is kind

248
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,260
of disappointing when it when you see

249
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:52,260
like okay it's 2019 and I'm still

250
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:56,790
finding sequel injection but I really do

251
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,560
think that we need to kind of modernize

252
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,250
a lot of stuff

253
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,300
everyone's kind of sitting around being

254
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:07,200
like wait what how do i kubernetes what

255
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,990
wait what is the best practice for that

256
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:12,120
you know like there isn't any sort of

257
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,120
checklist that you can say like it's

258
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,760
everyone's still like it sort of reminds

259
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,740
me of when cloud services started to

260
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,770
come out you know maybe maybe around 10

261
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,360
years ago where everyone's like cloud

262
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,520
how do i cloud and now everyone's like

263
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,339
how do i how do i how do i kubernetes

264
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:34,260
how do i you know docker how do i do

265
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,630
like all those containerization stuff

266
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,010
it's just it just seems like we're

267
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:40,339
always playing a catch-up game whereas

268
00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:43,440
we I would love to see where we're a

269
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,410
little bit more forward-thinking and say

270
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:48,630
okay maybe this isn't the next big thing

271
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,339
but we should probably try to figure out

272
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:52,770
security before it just to go to them

273
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,630
because come the next big thing rather

274
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,760
than playing catch-up where everyone's

275
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,160
like oh yeah so I have all this stuff

276
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,870
out here using the latest and greatest

277
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:03,480
but oops it's all insecure because

278
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,250
nobody told me how to secure it because

279
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,870
nobody was thinking that it was actually

280
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,570
gonna become what it became

281
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:12,600
and I guess sorry char just what

282
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,640
certainly and I guess what that proves

283
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,620
is that we we're now talking about

284
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,320
software as everything right so your

285
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,030
infrastructure as code is now code

286
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,260
everything else is software and

287
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,420
configuration and I guess therein lies

288
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,580
the problem of introduction of risks so

289
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,340
yeah yeah so so the one thing that's

290
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:35,220
always kind of made me worried and

291
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,130
frustrated in the senses so for example

292
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:40,980
I went through three year Kansai course

293
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,470
the donners not once I learned hey

294
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,330
what's cross-site scripting what sequel

295
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:48,120
injection so you've got all these people

296
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,940
learn how to develop but they have not

297
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,040
clear about developing security they're

298
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,920
not even aware the code the development

299
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,720
is insecure so I see you mention you you

300
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,880
NYU is that changing aren't the base

301
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,810
fundamental or like computer science

302
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:09,570
degrees changing and bowling security

303
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:12,720
into them yeah we're definitely trying

304
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,740
to you know okay you want to write for

305
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:20,340
example I mean everyone's moving towards

306
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,140
man languages I remember when I took

307
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:26,640
computer science it was uh all C C++ and

308
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,220
nobody ever told me how to properly or

309
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,620
securely manage memory but now that

310
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,320
everything's moving towards Java go Ruby

311
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,210
things like that the focus needs to be

312
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:42,270
and and I think especially at NYU

313
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:46,190
because they have a entire dedicated

314
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:50,130
computer security program that we're

315
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:53,490
trying to get I actually would would

316
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,290
love to sit down an audit one of like

317
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:58,500
the you know CS 101 classes just just to

318
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,460
make sure that they're not doing

319
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,550
anything weird I should probably do that

320
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,710
thank you I will write this outcome but

321
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:07,770
I don't I I can only speak for my

322
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:10,320
experiences at NYU but it definitely is

323
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,590
trying to to bake that in in terms of

324
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:16,530
here's the right way to do things and

325
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:20,460
explain I I also think that a lot of the

326
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,170
classes sorry I'm kind of switching

327
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:24,270
tracks here some of the classes a lot of

328
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,410
the classes teach you the right way to

329
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:25,790
do

330
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:29,120
but they don't explain what I would like

331
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,130
to see is here's the wrong way to do it

332
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,470
here's the right way to do it and here's

333
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,330
why the wrong way to do it is totally

334
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:38,330
gonna ruin your day down the line you're

335
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,040
gonna you know like somebody's gonna do

336
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,960
like a pen tester somebody's gonna hack

337
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,190
your site and then you're gonna be

338
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,840
working weekends here's why you don't

339
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,520
want to do this she's gonna be working

340
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,950
weekends yeah like I don't I don't like

341
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:51,440
you know the constant scare mongering

342
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,720
that a lot of security people do but I

343
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,300
think for somebody who's just starting

344
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,580
out learning how to code or you know

345
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,950
learning how to use software engineering

346
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:04,460
or you know system architecture just

347
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:08,060
saying like this is this is gonna make

348
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,400
you make you have a bad day or a bad

349
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,430
evening or that couple evenings pain as

350
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,780
a pain as a modifier of behavior yeah

351
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:20,950
yeah it kind of reminds me of when I

352
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:25,520
went to school to driving school to get

353
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,950
my driver's license they showed us like

354
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:31,430
you know like videos of car accidents

355
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:34,280
and like how the jaws of life work like

356
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,830
to cut people out of cars and all this

357
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,210
stuff and you're like this is why you

358
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,460
wear your seat belt this is why you use

359
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,350
your turn signal this is why you don't

360
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:45,400
you know like cut across three lanes or

361
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,920
go 30 miles over the speed limit it just

362
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:53,240
like sometimes you kind of have to I

363
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,190
mean that that's probably why I would

364
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,810
never be a good coder actually is

365
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:58,940
because like every time I try to write

366
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:02,140
code my butthole clinches a little bit

367
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:05,569
I'm like oh god if I write insecure code

368
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:06,950
everyone is going to give me [ __ ]

369
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:09,680
because I should know better but I want

370
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,619
to throw something into the mix here

371
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:14,750
because this is what I find pretty

372
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,000
frustrating at the end of the day the

373
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,490
application sits on a lot of other stuff

374
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:22,660
right yeah and I sort of wonder how

375
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,740
frustrating it is from a software

376
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,319
development perspective when you know

377
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:29,600
the server's aren't patched and can't

378
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,260
even support TLS 1.3 and then the

379
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,720
firewall networking people have opened

380
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,790
up you know

381
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,310
half a dozen ports to the actual server

382
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:42,310
that you're sitting on like I get a loss

383
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,590
10 but I mean if you're building the

384
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,210
house of cards on something that's

385
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:51,490
already old I how and and so I guess the

386
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:54,820
big question is do software devs need to

387
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,550
understand the whole stock from layer 1

388
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:04,510
all the way up to layer 7 I I I'm gonna

389
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:07,660
say right now yes yeah I be it shouldn't

390
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:10,210
be that way because every a layer of you

391
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:12,250
know implementation should have security

392
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,800
savvy people so that we can trust them -

393
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,240
yeah it's trust but verify

394
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,680
but still you know understand that we

395
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,690
have documented ok you want it to punch

396
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,670
5 holes in the firewall let's let's

397
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,680
understand why that is and maybe revisit

398
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,720
it down the line and see if we still

399
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,810
need those holes punched we maybe close

400
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:37,750
them up but now I think you know yeah

401
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,450
it's sort of like the analogy I use with

402
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,190
my students the sort of like the Leaning

403
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,920
Tower of Pisa which is you know if it's

404
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,900
properly it's it's a perfectly nice

405
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,150
architected building but they built it

406
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:57,850
on very crappy lands and the and now

407
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:00,760
it's tilting and the the building wasn't

408
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,360
designed to hang at that angle so now

409
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,950
there's there's all this of Keith that

410
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,510
they need to do because you know like

411
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:10,600
you have this giant Tower that's leaning

412
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,600
it like what like a 35 75 whatever

413
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,620
degree and it'll and it wasn't built to

414
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,830
handle that ankle just like an

415
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,780
application where you know you built it

416
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,760
securely assuming that all of the stuff

417
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:30,400
underneath is secure it's not gonna work

418
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,470
at my angle if all the stuff you know

419
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,540
you need to code defensively knowing

420
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,060
what the underlying stuff is so that you

421
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,640
know like hey okay well we're building

422
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,710
we haven't been able to patch to the

423
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,780
latest greatest version of I don't know

424
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:48,190
no js' or you know apache or whatever

425
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,660
the heck you're using

426
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,480
or you know like where we we're still

427
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,100
running on like windows 7or I can think

428
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,250
of like you know you have to take that

429
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,480
into consideration when you're building

430
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,900
your application because you can't

431
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,450
assume that your foundation is good

432
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:10,770
agreed and go what's your point in there

433
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:13,180
certainly in the UK we're not teaching

434
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,220
that to people in university we're not

435
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,770
teaching the idea that there is an OSI

436
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:21,700
model it's nothing right so when we talk

437
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:25,240
about all the you know understanding the

438
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,570
full stack I see students all the time

439
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:31,630
that are being taught PHP or the means

440
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,570
or database technology but they're not

441
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:37,240
being they're not being taught yes

442
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,790
they're not be taught the the absolute

443
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:42,310
fundamentals and but by the way the

444
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:44,200
these aren't cops I courses these are

445
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,980
computer security courses yeah yes

446
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,500
indeed in the UK and so why a student

447
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,200
needs to go away and do a year on PHP I

448
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,890
have absolutely no idea when when that

449
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:00,990
year could be better spent learning JIRA

450
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:17,470
you [ __ ] cynic we stopped learning

451
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,930
experience don't let us ticketing

452
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:28,690
systems no absolutely in PHP is defense

453
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:31,210
I think that's actually a good way to

454
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:33,610
learn security just because there's so

455
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:38,380
many ways you can screw it up yeah like

456
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:44,560
I mean that that's one other first whoa

457
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,800
I guess technically the first like web

458
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,230
language I did write a bunch of cgi-bin

459
00:21:50,230 --> 00:22:06,790
stuff and see because it was yellow

460
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:14,620
black blinking text all right under

461
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:20,230
construction listen we are done our time

462
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:23,740
is done with you Kelly and it happened

463
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:26,250
so fast

464
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:29,500
but now it was brilliant absolutely cool

465
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:37,150
so cool will you enjoy doing that and on

466
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:38,740
behalf of the bear farmers and the

467
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,270
people listening thank you very much in

468
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,010
big feet so thank you for having it

469
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:44,710
having me hopefully I was not completely

470
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:49,720
nonsensical Thanks thanks Kelly all the

471
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,240
best yeah you too thanks for having me

472
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,930
cheers bye-bye
