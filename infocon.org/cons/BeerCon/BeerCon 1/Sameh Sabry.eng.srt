1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,129
so Sammy if you can go ahead and unmute

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:04,859
and tell us a little bit about you and

3
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:09,330
who you are well thank you very much and

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,630
I feel really privileged to be the first

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,930
six

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:19,130
one I feel happy as well slightly sleepy

7
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:24,290
because it's 12 a.m. here in Dubai it's

8
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:27,050
warm and rainy so I'm not sure it's the

9
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:31,460
best combination or not I guess being

10
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,329
warm is fine

11
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:34,550
yeah probably better than being too cold

12
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,250
and ready yeah

13
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:40,250
my name is Thomas Aubrey and this is my

14
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,320
name my handle my everything guy and

15
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,690
tend not to change my name as much

16
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:48,530
because well so many people would figure

17
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:51,579
out who I am anyway

18
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:54,940
so put your name out there I have been

19
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,370
doing sober security since I was a

20
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:00,430
teenager I've been wearing at many hats

21
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,739
and my life so this is why I love that

22
00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:06,490
many hats Club I've been doing mini hats

23
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:07,330
in my life

24
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:10,600
and but recently and for the for the

25
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,190
last probably 10 years of my life have

26
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:16,000
been more glue than anything else trying

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,979
to sit next to the people who are

28
00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:21,479
defending the world for a better cause

29
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:25,960
so I work with cyber security companies

30
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,610
and today I work with that cyber

31
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:31,710
security software company I play music I

32
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:37,330
cook but I speak a few languages so I

33
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,759
might pick up a few words here and there

34
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,970
and English is not my first or second

35
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,850
language so I find something please

36
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,330
don't judge

37
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,640
honestly speaking today I went when I

38
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,410
speak and when I spoke earlier to the

39
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,390
guys about what should we be covering

40
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,910
today and in there there was was

41
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:03,420
basically an open platform so today I

42
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,940
have a few things to share with you of

43
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,220
which one of them is personal and I

44
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,679
thought maybe other people could benefit

45
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:14,090
from it and the rest are more in

46
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,770
information security so that I'll start

47
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,950
with a personal piece in 2009 in

48
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,140
specifically in the last few months I

49
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,020
realized on a very personal level that

50
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,420
actually eating fats could help you lose

51
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:32,400
weight for for yeah for so many years we

52
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,500
thought that fat is bad and fats are

53
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,709
evil but I realize the mat last couple

54
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:40,860
months that if you eat good fats you are

55
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,709
actually on a good direction of losing

56
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:45,630
weight so a person like me who needs to

57
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,420
lose a lot of weight started using that

58
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,790
and in the last couple months I almost

59
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:55,080
lost 10 kilograms now you do now you do

60
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,709
the math so you get it in pounds or

61
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:01,739
whatever measure 2 Q 2.2 pounds to

62
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:03,630
kilograms that's that's an amazing

63
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,900
accomplishment

64
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:13,260
I need another 30 or 30 kilograms so you

65
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,060
do the math as well gotcha

66
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,700
no I this is basically based on stopping

67
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,400
carbs eating healthy fats eating good

68
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,470
and real butter real not basically

69
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:28,470
handling the sugar and insulin levels in

70
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:28,920
your blood

71
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,280
oh yeah boy that's great

72
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,560
do you think this is do you think this

73
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,350
is a major problem then because of like

74
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,739
the introduction of Western foods into

75
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:42,120
the Middle East

76
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,640
and the fact that the Mediterranean diet

77
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,910
was largely one of the most healthy

78
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,890
diets that you can have do you feel that

79
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:55,590
it has Outd with John oh well the Middle

80
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,990
East is a really big term you probably

81
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,340
know that more than anyone else

82
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,220
yeah for so many

83
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,140
areas and regions in Middle East food is

84
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,120
basically Elias and something next to it

85
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,490
what a spirit and something next to it

86
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:12,630
so I I wouldn't really blame the Western

87
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,140
cultures

88
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,589
and other things but this one I believe

89
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:20,750
it it's all our fault that's all our a

90
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,920
mistake because we typically eat rice

91
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,350
and anything next to it or bread and

92
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:33,050
anything and carbs actually manipulates

93
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,910
the sugar levels in your blood and

94
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:38,090
therefore you feel really hungry and you

95
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:41,690
eat much more than you could and you eat

96
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,910
all the bad things and the body can only

97
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:47,570
take a few a few grams of carbs and

98
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:50,750
everything else becomes fat and that's

99
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,700
that fats that lives in your blood

100
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,540
but while consuming good fats and I and

101
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,000
I and I keep on taking good fats by

102
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,680
consuming good fats you will make sure

103
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,540
that there are no sugar spikes or

104
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,480
insulin spikes and therefore your budget

105
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,480
is saturated for the longer period of

106
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,160
time and actually you teach your body

107
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,260
and this is why I like it and it's

108
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,690
called biohacking you teach your body to

109
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,090
live on fats instead of living on

110
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:21,710
glucose or sugar and it helped me a lot

111
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,590
on a personal level giving the

112
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,480
confidence that I can break the norm

113
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,550
because everyone a dummy can only eat

114
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,950
rice and something next to it over bread

115
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,840
and something next to it and guess what

116
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,760
for the last nine weeks I have been

117
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:41,270
consuming zero carbs no zero rice zero

118
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,880
bread zero straightforward cards which

119
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,470
give me another dimension of my

120
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,040
personality that I could do something

121
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,930
something something different something

122
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:55,400
that I never thought I could I could do

123
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,130
some I can ask you a question please

124
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,860
so there is a theory that if you eat

125
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,300
well then your mental health is

126
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,870
generally better yeah could be something

127
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:08,000
I've dreamt some night Silas your bread

128
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,190
I do believe that is the case could you

129
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,930
say that that's helped you in your own

130
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,220
mental health the fact that you've got a

131
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,080
better diet you're feeling better about

132
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,300
itself obviously you your body's in

133
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,100
better condition does that make you feel

134
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,960
better and mentally so would without any

135
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,190
scientific reasons and I can assure you

136
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,330
that this

137
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,850
this statement is 10,000 percent correct

138
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:37,010
for sama public wireless for me I double

139
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,500
again when you're too heavy you need to

140
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,540
feel that everything is hard you have no

141
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,370
energy you don't want to wake up in the

142
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,490
morning you're always in a bad mood

143
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,080
you're always giving yourself an excuse

144
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,310
not to do something

145
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,500
however when you feel like that when you

146
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,530
feel easier what honestly I have been

147
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,080
having no naps and I don't need naps I

148
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,460
have been ok with with caffeine but not

149
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,090
too much caffeine I start I stopped

150
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,820
having heartburn which was a really

151
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,410
major problem and it's a major problem

152
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:12,620
50 whew overweight people because we eat

153
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:17,300
more than an average person so honestly

154
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,290
speaking eating better according to my

155
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,690
current diet plan makes me feel much

156
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:28,550
better lighter funnier easier it helped

157
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,770
it helped a lot yeah and this is what I

158
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:34,100
actually wanted to start my my 20-minute

159
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,590
window with something personal that to

160
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:40,310
work yes that a changing diet could

161
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:43,840
actually help but actually it does so I

162
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,460
introduced that thing as well

163
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,620
intermittent fasting and that is helping

164
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,570
a lot I never thought that I could stay

165
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,240
for 16 hours or 18 hours without food

166
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,240
but now I do and I'm not cranky and I'm

167
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,540
not mad that I'm not feeling you know

168
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:05,060
angry I'm actually okay yeah so the

169
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,280
first thing that I learned in 2019 is

170
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,360
that changing your food as possible and

171
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,550
whatever I've been eating for the last

172
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:16,790
so many years of my life is is something

173
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:19,730
you could change and it changes changes

174
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:23,210
sometimes really good and and the fact

175
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:26,780
that I used for this term the sentence I

176
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,720
used and I kept it on a small paper that

177
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,340
the whole world tells your fats would

178
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,919
kill you but in reality good fats could

179
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,289
help you become better and even lose

180
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:38,409
weight if that's what not for your goals

181
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:41,690
really that's that's the person in peace

182
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:42,539
that

183
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,279
the technical piece or the information

184
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:47,310
security relevant piece is honestly

185
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:51,360
focusing on focusing on understanding

186
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,720
what you can do and what you have

187
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,320
versus what you want that cheese and let

188
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,389
me explain a little bit on what I mean

189
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:03,480
by that sense so many of us probably all

190
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:10,290
of us and even more people than me a lot

191
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:15,040
we've been focusing about the very

192
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,400
complex things the very hard change to

193
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,100
deliver the very hard things to achieve

194
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,339
while neglecting the fact that these

195
00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:26,440
things might not be maximum with

196
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,810
available resources we'll give you an

197
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:32,320
example you I cover the Middle East 30

198
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,740
and Africa within my control so if I

199
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:39,470
have a technology at the end

200
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:43,400
many cases and then you know I see

201
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,320
people who do not even know the

202
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,090
difference between a firewall and

203
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:50,480
antivirus it would be really stupid to

204
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,830
teach them or to give them a security

205
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,590
software that is based on click on thing

206
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:00,110
for exam you know what I mean like if if

207
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,260
I

208
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:06,600
the right basics

209
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,320
the unrealistic stupids choose my

210
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,020
friends to to give them something as

211
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,480
advanced as a realtor hunting platform

212
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,480
or looking for anomalies or looking for

213
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,570
in memory process project injection but

214
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:25,740
you know what I mean I learned I learned

215
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,200
that understanding your limits and

216
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,150
understanding your available resources

217
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,160
whether it's a budget whether it's

218
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,770
people whether it's who you speak with

219
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:37,370
whether it's the language I have been in

220
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,260
so many countries with so many different

221
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,110
languages imagine you know if you give

222
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,510
if you if you give someone who doesn't

223
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,540
speak English at all a phenomenal play

224
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,450
by Shakespeare he or she is not gonna

225
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,160
get out of it and then say you know what

226
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,260
that was stupid I wasted as so many

227
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,850
hours of my time watching or listening

228
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:59,220
or reading about Shakespeare right yeah

229
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,320
although it's really an amazing piece on

230
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,780
its own so understanding what you have

231
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,550
and understanding your limit

232
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,230
understanding your capability

233
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,810
understanding what's there helped me a

234
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:12,900
lot as a consultant in positioning that

235
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,880
I've technology for the right people and

236
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,470
there is no one fit for everyone there

237
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,690
of course there are some similarities

238
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:24,750
between people and needs and wants and

239
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,940
stuff like that however there's not

240
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,460
there's nothing such as this is the

241
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,340
right solution for everyone on earth for

242
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:37,290
every demand on earth period so stuff

243
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,600
like ease of use stuff like language

244
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,460
stuff like understanding human resources

245
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,280
and human power really helped me a lot

246
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,520
shape a lot of my recommendations and

247
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,400
suggestions for 2019 to so many

248
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,530
different people and in my opinion the

249
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,030
results were much better than what I

250
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:57,780
thought than what I expected so that was

251
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:02,860
the second piece today we intend to

252
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,200
try to achieve the best or try to get

253
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,510
the best or try to do the best but

254
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,280
sometimes doing the best or achieving

255
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,240
the best is not necessarily

256
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,519
really the best for that specific

257
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:16,949
customer or that specific user or that

258
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:20,759
specific consumer in in a direct way or

259
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:21,839
another does that make sense

260
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,589
I just yeah I am I able to to push the

261
00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:27,839
message that for me what I'm trying to

262
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,720
say is example I've seen a customer in a

263
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,399
government sector in the Middle East who

264
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,389
has zero people that speaks English and

265
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:38,249
they were evaluating to software

266
00:12:38,249 --> 00:12:40,110
solutions one and both of them were for

267
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:43,050
anti-spam get win it's nothing major one

268
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,600
of them required a lot of English skills

269
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,480
to read through the menus and to read

270
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,819
through the configuration I was honestly

271
00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:52,470
done in a way that was really hard for

272
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:55,050
for so many people so they don't have a

273
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:57,449
security background they have very basic

274
00:12:57,449 --> 00:12:59,730
knowledge of English and you need to

275
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:02,300
build it from the scratch versus another

276
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,369
smaller technology not as sophisticated

277
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:08,819
as technology aid but it had three

278
00:13:08,819 --> 00:13:11,879
buttons on and off so for me as a

279
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:14,279
consultant when I looked at this I

280
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:17,069
cannot decide maybe the smaller

281
00:13:17,069 --> 00:13:19,649
technology that only has three or enough

282
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:22,290
muffins or most are more suitable than

283
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:25,079
your things because in both scenarios

284
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:27,809
you have no one to administrate them no

285
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:29,999
one would know that with more knowledge

286
00:13:29,999 --> 00:13:33,720
to really configure any of them and more

287
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,889
important you don't even understand half

288
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:40,019
of what's written on the first one sure

289
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,850
why don't you go with the second one and

290
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:44,309
achieve out of ten scenarios without

291
00:13:44,309 --> 00:13:46,410
touching anything versus achieving zero

292
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:49,709
scenario of ten does that make sense yes

293
00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:53,339
it does you know I learned that so

294
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:56,490
instead of trying to put everything I

295
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:59,670
know and to achieve everything I know or

296
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:02,429
you know everything what everything you

297
00:14:02,429 --> 00:14:05,519
know as the best of the best possible

298
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,759
sometimes you need to downgrade a little

299
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:10,529
bit to achieve something that makes more

300
00:14:10,529 --> 00:14:14,069
sense that is more relevant to the

301
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:15,929
current situation and more relevant to

302
00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:18,679
the available resources yeah a great

303
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:20,939
completely the last piece I want to

304
00:14:20,939 --> 00:14:23,999
share with you is I had this I had this

305
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,150
talk at another conference

306
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,850
and Las Vegas blackhat I'm not sure if I

307
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,800
could mention conference names or not

308
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:36,260
because I just did so last week is I had

309
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,690
this conference I had the speaking slot

310
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:41,630
in blackhat this year and wasn't really

311
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,110
super technical but I want to share two

312
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,430
notes from that one with you as well

313
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,839
because that's something I learned in

314
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,390
2019 and I was able to document it as

315
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:54,050
well is how we see others how we see how

316
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:57,050
defenders see attackers on how attackers

317
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:59,450
see us and it's amazing because that's

318
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:02,060
life game from different resources

319
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,860
different people over the internet as

320
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:06,880
different with Twitter polls different

321
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,740
feeds

322
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:13,040
it's amazing how hard our jobs is versus

323
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,160
how easier it is to be on the attacker

324
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,140
side and I'm not saying that finding

325
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:21,589
novel techniques and eateth noble ideas

326
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:25,430
is easy but for us we have thousands and

327
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:29,570
thousands of hosts to defend 24 by 7 36

328
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:32,600
5 days of the year or even more because

329
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,750
it's more than 3 6 5 yeah however for

330
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,080
them we just need to compromise one host

331
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,330
we need to accomplish or exploit one

332
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:44,209
credibility for us we need to patch and

333
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:46,690
fix every possible vulnerability

334
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:49,459
attackers are highly paid defenses are

335
00:15:49,459 --> 00:15:52,160
typically not highly based in comparison

336
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,550
what to what attackers I make and

337
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:57,920
defenders are static they don't move as

338
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,410
much attackers are moving all the time

339
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:02,810
and today I'm getting a text from a

340
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:05,570
gentleman in China tomorrow from Russia

341
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,430
after the model from Egypt after

342
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,380
tomorrow from the UK and these guys keep

343
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,450
on changing in different time zones

344
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:14,510
different locations while at my location

345
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:17,270
my IP might have been a might my

346
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:20,690
existing in the real world remains

347
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:23,150
almost the same I have a very limited

348
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,220
time and resources they have infinite

349
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,770
time and resources for them failure

350
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:30,140
means you know what screw it next victim

351
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,540
let me see for us in so many cases

352
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,579
specifically in the Middle East and even

353
00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:37,820
more in Dubai and Kuwait and Saudi and

354
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,400
this part of the world failure inside

355
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,310
security echo there equals to in so many

356
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,650
cases getting fire than going back home

357
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:51,890
sure so that's that's you one

358
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:54,500
if I can call it or like one bird's-eye

359
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,080
view of my tactics versus defenders that

360
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:01,970
I was able to get get this year and

361
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,010
honestly it was a consolidation of what

362
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:06,950
we learned in the last few years and and

363
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:09,050
honestly just to leave something with

364
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:12,109
you something more positive I learned

365
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:17,839
that with the use of human skills we can

366
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,700
get to get a lot of that but that's not

367
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,730
enough because there are not so many

368
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:24,740
there's not so much expertise in the

369
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,260
world enough to stop every possible bad

370
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:31,670
thing so I believe the way to get closer

371
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:35,120
to defend get closer to attackers and

372
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,300
even and potentially try to be at their

373
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:42,350
same speed is by using a lot of data

374
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:44,330
science a lot of machine learning a lot

375
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,360
of artificial intelligence trying to

376
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,910
automate a lot of the things that this

377
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:53,180
is not require very complicated power

378
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,390
very complicated mindset but tries to or

379
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:59,390
uses a lot of muscle work and if

380
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:01,310
possible that would be ideal to

381
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:04,250
orchestrate the remaining part so we try

382
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,800
to leverage a lot of data science and

383
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:11,270
artificial intelligence to because we

384
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:15,260
are as humans we are not enough and so

385
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,110
we need to depend on our good brain and

386
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:22,280
building good models and automate a lot

387
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:26,450
of these positive and potentially that

388
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:29,180
would be perfect an ideal a store Trish

389
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,610
or could fit whatever AI and automation

390
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,970
couldn't fit by using a mask any the

391
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:37,900
loop not just man on top of them yeah

392
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,970
this was everything I have two minutes

393
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:42,860
left if there is a question I would love

394
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,720
to take it yeah Sammy I've got a

395
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:50,000
question so you you obviously are in the

396
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,670
middle in the Middle East are you seeing

397
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:55,070
because the population is really young

398
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:58,250
are you seeing people go into the cyber

399
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,890
security professional computer science

400
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:04,840
or IT as viable career options

401
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,120
or or your people still kind of

402
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,850
skeptical that that's a good way to make

403
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:13,090
a living or or or contribute what is

404
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:15,610
your feeling it's actually it's the

405
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:18,789
complete opposite so right now in the

406
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:21,220
Middle East everyone and I literally

407
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,169
mean everyone wants to become a cyber

408
00:19:23,169 --> 00:19:25,210
security professional or an information

409
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:27,850
security professional not because

410
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,130
everyone has the passion for it but

411
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:33,730
because it's one of the few areas where

412
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:37,559
people are not still able to shut down

413
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:41,580
in so many cases you see that at all for

414
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,049
2020 we're not going to do any network

415
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:45,909
renovation we're not going to do any

416
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:48,820
infrastructure innovation but we'll

417
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,130
still spend money on security so people

418
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:54,220
see the need of security in the market

419
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,860
and therefore anyone who is around the

420
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:00,039
technology space is trying and one way

421
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:01,809
or the other to get into the information

422
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:04,179
security spaces to be honest because if

423
00:20:04,179 --> 00:20:10,990
it is the highest paying job today and

424
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:13,480
it's because it's it's relatively more

425
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,570
stable and honestly there are less

426
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:18,460
people in that space so it's not as

427
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:21,899
saturated as other areas like you know

428
00:20:21,899 --> 00:20:25,270
application development or system

429
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,159
engineering but you know what I mean so

430
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,190
the traditional would traditionally is

431
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:33,100
very valuable because killer a system

432
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,559
engineer is a real could be really good

433
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:39,309
security expert yeah but you know I've

434
00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:41,890
seen more people especially the right

435
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:43,990
now so many of the newer universities in

436
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:46,720
the Middle East are accelerating their

437
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,210
schools with some other good schools in

438
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:51,100
the US and the UK in Europe in general

439
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,710
and Australia and in Canada and so many

440
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,669
different and good respectable called

441
00:20:56,669 --> 00:21:00,940
universities and schools so the programs

442
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,710
for information securities became

443
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:05,470
available before that went back in the

444
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:08,049
days that people who taught me security

445
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:11,049
were mathematicians because the security

446
00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:14,080
topic was not even there right right or

447
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,630
for security people it was all about

448
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:17,980
encryption

449
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,919
and communication encryption because of

450
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:23,230
the middle-east and Wars and armies so

451
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,059
foreign and secure communication was

452
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:27,669
something they knew or the at least they

453
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:29,880
thought they knew

454
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,070
so no but right now we see more programs

455
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,630
in schools we see more programs and

456
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:37,390
universities and the IT became part of

457
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:40,630
our daily life so my dad was 70 years

458
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,790
old knows what's a virus what's a

459
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,710
problem with a malware and knows that to

460
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:47,860
come to a PC or a laptop or or a mobile

461
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:50,860
device so because of the availability of

462
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,370
these ideas it became more exciting to

463
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:57,010
more people to join that feel yeah of

464
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:57,429
course

465
00:21:57,429 --> 00:22:01,419
cool okay summer awesome thank you very

466
00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:03,040
much indeed for sharing some your

467
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:03,790
insights

468
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:07,120
Percy really yeah I personally found you

469
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,520
rim you testimony around changing your

470
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,960
diet and changing your life to be

471
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,000
fascinating so thank you very much

472
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,669
indeed for that thank you

473
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:17,919
so we've got a couple of minutes before

474
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,150
we have Zoe rose up a quick update on

475
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,340
this god it's kind of up and it's kind

476
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:31,960
of down and what we're not gonna do is

477
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,970
is talk about discord for the

478
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:37,120
foreseeable future I was just gonna say

479
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,030
Mike if you're watching on assume we've

480
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:42,940
had a few extra beer farmers join us

481
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,400
tonight I think you'd be great

482
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,860
John open Dekker do you want to say

483

pre-dynastic I don't know

497
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:39,890
if you if he unmutes it could be very

498
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,930
loud as there's usually a dog trying to

499
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,760
terrible that's true that's true

500
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,380
good evening good evening

501
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:51,020
apologies for my voice I'm full of the

502
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:54,260
illness that's going around the house so

503
00:23:54,260 --> 00:24:01,580

504
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:06,200
finally have this upon us it's taking a

505
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,350
lot of effort to get you but I think it

506
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:11,170
will be all worth it in the end
