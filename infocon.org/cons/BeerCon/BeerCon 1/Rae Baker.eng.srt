15
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,650
security I my background is graphic

16
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,450
design and I've been doing that for

17
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,220
about 15 years

18
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,220
I started school first security and risk

19
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,880
analysis about a year ago almost yeah to

20
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,150
the semester a year ago and from there I

21
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:27,299
attended Larry conference and I played a

22
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:32,159
trace labs missing person event and from

23
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,140
there I got really into open source

24
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,860
intelligence so that's kind of where my

25
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:42,570
focus has gone so I go to school I'm the

26
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,479
president of the tech Club at Penn State

27
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,700
as well so I've made a lot of

28
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,950
connections right way and like we bring

29
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,070
a lot of speakers in and they talk to

30
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:58,860
the club virtually I also volunteer for

31
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,530
operations they just be oh okay listen

32
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,259
Ally we heard from Joey on that yeah

33
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:08,250
yeah so I do a investigation for them

34
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,770
and I've kind of become

35
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:16,890
oh great freakin yeah so that's that's

36
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,890
right it's been a nice turn

37
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:22,230
that's one suspect so describe your day

38
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,050
at work what do you get up to well my

39
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,020
day at work is still designed so oh my

40
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,500
my security stuff is after that I do a

41
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,490
lot of self-study so I spend a lot of

42
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:41,480
time writing blogs on security and ocean

43
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,980
to teach myself things because you know

44
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,170
you go to school and they teach you

45
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,230
things but not everything you need to

46
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:53,300
know so I try and like filling the gaps

47
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:57,090
so I read a lot of blogs and then I do a

48
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,080
lot of work with operation save escape

49
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,150
writing training and designing stuff

50
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:08,010
doing those that work with domestic

51
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:12,660
violence victims stuff like that super

52
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:16,410
cool so earlier we have Rock and Viking

53
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:19,020
talking about the ocean were they do you

54
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,320
know it's pretty incredible stuff so it

55
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,720
sounds like you you're applying what you

56
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,810
do in a similar kind of context in terms

57
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,450
of you know keeping people safe finding

58
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,130
people and all kind of stuff is that

59
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:36,900
fair yes yes so the operation safe

60
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:42,480
escape work we basically like reverse

61
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,800
those victims of domestic violence who

62
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,959
have come to us for help to see where

63
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:49,830
they're vulnerable

64
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,530
and we'll offer them like training and

65
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:56,760
tips on how to secure their devices and

66
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,790
and pull themselves away from their

67
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:03,660
abusers get them home that's so

68
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,000
important because one of the realities

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,840
is that I feel that the technology that

70
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,780
we've come to rely on actually has made

71
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:18,149
stalking easier and and as a result of

72
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:20,548
that if you aren't an information

73
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:22,019
security

74
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:26,520
Center practitioner the basic security

75
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,430
of your device of your technological

76
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,300
life of your online accounts is really

77
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,300
esoteric it's it's out of reach for you

78
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,849
know somebody that isn't in this

79
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:43,129
industry and from one of these people

80
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:45,900
the people that are abusing them are ten

81
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,520
people yes which makes it even harder

82
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,590
yeah and you know it ranges from the

83
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:56,220
types of things to because you know IOT

84
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:01,229
is giving you know an attacker the

85
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:04,680
ability to you know monitor things that

86
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,289
are going on in the home I you know and

87
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:09,900
through baby monitors and turning those

88
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,389
on and things like that so the attack

89
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:14,370
surface I think for a person that is

90
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:19,069
trying to dismiss keep a domestic

91
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:24,210
domestic relationship gone bad is so

92
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,830
broad and I don't think we think about

93
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,020
that a lot we think about oh you know

94
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,389
get a good password on your on your

95
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:33,539
phone but it's you know a lot of the

96
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:36,000
times it's the apps it's the checking in

97
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,180
its yes yes doctor we're yeah and when

98
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,099
you talking about a relationship a

99
00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:46,139
person that you trust them that's

100
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:48,900
already in a rather powerful position

101
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,349
compared to say some thread actor that

102
00:05:52,349 --> 00:05:54,029
you've never met and they're trying to

103
00:05:54,029 --> 00:05:57,060
hack your websites yeah and we've had

104
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,099
stuff like people putting things in the

105
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:02,969
cars to track them like you know stuff

106
00:06:02,969 --> 00:06:05,870
that that an average person would never

107
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:11,039
consider even looking for yeah yeah Wow

108
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,319
and so I what is sort of the

109
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:17,279
relationship then with law enforcement

110
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:20,069
because I know if you have a bunch of

111
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:21,990
evidence and you show okay this is a

112
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,789
very bad person they've done this they

113
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:26,389
just they've done this are you getting

114
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:28,889
support from law enforcement or

115
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:32,820
prosecutors or is yes you are good we

116
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,720
have

117
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,850
I know there's lawyers that we have that

118
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:39,470
work pro bono with a lot of the victims

119
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:44,670
in their state and I know law

120
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,280
enforcement does work with a lot of them

121
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,100
to help summer more helpful than others

122
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,900
but I know we started working with New

123
00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:00,780
York recently Chris gave a talk and he's

124
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:07,560
the executive director he gave us so

125
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,460
their domestic violence team is very

126
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:17,880
connected with us right now and and so

127
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,780
is their hope I mean you know that's

128
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,890
really that baller

129
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,360
dollar ninety a question you're putting

130
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,100
a lot of time and effort into this

131
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,950
you've created the not-for-profit I are

132
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,770
you are you feeling like you have some

133
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:35,520
victories to celebrate oh yeah yeah I

134
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,810
personally have been on maybe two or

135
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:43,050
three O's in cases where I followed it

136
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,640
from the beginning like phone

137
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,210
conversations with the victims and we've

138
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,490
had several outcomes that have been very

139
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,640
nice to hear oh we do see that what

140
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,480
we're doing is making an impact I think

141
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,910
it's just snowballs the more people who

142
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:02,250
hear about it that it's an option and

143
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,170
the more people we connect with and

144
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:08,600
companies and help out the easier it is

145
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,840
are there any sort of fundamental kind

146
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,300
of things that you keep seeing over and

147
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,460
over again that people are doing that

148
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,170
they really shouldn't be doing like are

149
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,510
there any sort of common takeaways or

150
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:30,630
threads common not most of the cases

151
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,840
come in and we'll tell them you know

152
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,610
change your passwords do this the stuff

153
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,610
they're coming to us with is kind of

154
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:44,730
random and half of it is they have a

155
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:47,460
feeling that somebody is doing something

156
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,020
but they're not sure they don't

157
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,120
understand like what's going on they

158
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,870
think somebody's tracking their car so a

159
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,399
lot of it is us trying to figure out

160
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,320
what is actually going on and what the

161
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,529
abuser is saying is happening but is it

162
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:02,430
really happening

163
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:07,140
you can ask your Rea in the next 12

164
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:11,339
months what you plans to broaden out the

165
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:13,020
work that you're doing sounds like

166
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:17,089

trained to assist with like technology

175
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,440
issues because I don't know how to deal

176
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,850
with that when somebody calls in and

177
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,270
says you know my partner is stalking me

178
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:54,089
through my car or my phone you know they

179
00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:56,310
don't know what to say so we're creating

180
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:57,959
training materials for that sort of

181
00:09:57,959 --> 00:09:58,880
thing

182
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,260
reaching out to companies and getting

183
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:05,940
their buy-in on you know helping us

184
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,160
giving us products that we can then give

185
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,300
to victims

186
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:15,450
personally I am you know going to school

187
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,880
so to try to get through another year of

188
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,350
that and just I mean this year has been

189
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,839
crazy for me I went from knowing nothing

190
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:28,320
and no one at security to people reading

191
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,779
my blogs and caring about things that I

192
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:34,020
say and that's seems incredible for a

193
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,740
year so I'm just gonna keep truckin with

194
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,850
that well you can test it yeah I mean

195
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,899
you keep up that work and you know the

196
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:47,910
great thing there are a thousand other

197
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,500
people like you doing the same thing

198
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,459
because if it saves the life of an

199
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:58,110
individual then it's worth doing right I

200
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:00,350
always say that when the bear

201
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:03,260
do a talk if we influence one person in

202
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,990
the audience to go and do something good

203
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,760
