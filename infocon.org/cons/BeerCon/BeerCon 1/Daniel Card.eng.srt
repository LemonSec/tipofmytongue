1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,859
right Daniel it's Daniel Oh God

2
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:07,830
is that we're building and he got his he

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,900
got his card out this evening Daniel we

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,049
were just amazed by you my friend well

5
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:14,639
you know it was there it's the right

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,980
number right well the great number it

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,410
was the absolute number the sweet spot

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,930
of numbers everybody can donate what you

9
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,880
donated then we're well we're gonna have

10
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,410
a bloody good holiday just don't tell my

11
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,610
missus cuz nothing about what we do it's

12
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,739
public right that is true that is true

13
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:36,360
but you never know probably doesn't

14
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,940
watch my Twitter feed for what so it

15
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,760
isn't much interests as a as really

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,879
doing anything else I think so the

17
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,579
benefit of several whispers yes let's

18
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,039
let's ceremony listeners we currently

19
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,629
have 49 listeners for eyes dumb card is

20
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:58,440
an honorary bear farmer he is indeed for

21
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,739
many many reasons but for one real

22
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:03,960
particularly powerful reason tonight in

23
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,850
that a donated 1337 pounds to our cause

24
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:12,020
which is incredible which is 32 single

25
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:16,020
target yes in one single donation so

26
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,040
damn we thank you no problemo well

27
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,350
that's a it's like my customers pay

28
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,380
their invoices on time right just send

29
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,409
me any around speaking of which I think

30
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:30,210
people need to know a little bit about

31
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,540
Daniel cards so Daniel how did you get

32
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,640
into information security and and and

33
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,310
how did you sort of like become the

34
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,740
major success and mogul that you are

35
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,350
today

36
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,310
[Laughter]

37
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:47,299
oh sure major successful mobile but and

38
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:49,740
how did I get into information security

39
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,820
well I think it's how I got into

40
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:56,100
technology and when I was a kid

41
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,159
my parents got a PC they installed doom

42
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,570
and they said you were not allowed to

43
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,000
play this game right course you know

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,560
like that was like absolutely the game I

45
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,080
was coming to play say yeah not only did

46
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,910
I manage to uh I mean it the way they

47
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,380
stopped to try to stop me was stupid

48
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,750
they yeah I think they they hit the file

49
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,520
so I wouldn't know where they were so I

50
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:19,230
didn't know to run them which is clearly

51
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,140
a bit nuts so there was a law a hacker

52
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,680
damn yeah yeah little hacker Dan and but

53
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,569
they also had only configured the PT

54
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:29,819
sound card and you guys are probably of

55
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:31,350
the right age to remember what that

56
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:34,709
sounds like oh yeah that was pretty [ __ ]

57
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:37,739
anyways I an able the sound blaster and

58
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:39,750
I scared the [ __ ] out of myself because

59
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,480
imps jumping out you fireballs growling

60
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,330
not on the PC speaker was a it was a

61
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:53,819
different experience so and I started

62
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:56,280
removing malware from small companies

63
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,180
machines and you know the start of my

64
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,739
technology journey was very much in the

65
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:04,230
gaming in the gaming space and I really

66
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,150
wanted to be a game designer I really

67
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,459
wanted to make games like doom and I

68
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:10,170
started doing level editing and 3d

69
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,600
modeling and graphics and I realized I

70
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,900
was really [ __ ] at those things and that

71
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,000
culminated around the half-life sort of

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,880
time when I released the level when I

73
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,410
was like I'm really not that good at

74
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,769
this um but I am pretty good at

75
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:27,959
understanding people's problems I'm good

76
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:29,670
at applying technology to them I'm good

77
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,440
at looking at things from a holistic

78
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,640
point of view and working broad and deep

79
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,320
level so I tend to fly around the broad

80
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,150
spectrum and then going to back at level

81
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,850
analysis when I need to learn lots of

82
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,530
things and then instantly move on to

83
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:47,880
something else and forget everything

84
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:53,430
I've learned say oh yeah that that's

85
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,140
really you know I started off her from

86
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,150
an avid gamer point of view I moved into

87
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:01,560
tech we've tech on security to me that

88
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,060
they are the same thing there's no

89
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,180
really like there's no difference

90
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,459
maybe that's the age thing but to me

91
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:09,960
technology deployment and

92
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,410
to get here just the same thing so you

93
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:18,450
you quite active in the CTF side of

94
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:22,680
things and and in fact you contribute a

95
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,410
lot you did quite a few CTS for the

96
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,990
b-sides do you only maybe give a quick

97
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:31,230
overview of what porn defenders yeah yes

98
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,800
I heard started and I just before you do

99
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,320
that just before you do that I apologize

100
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,680
for my colleagues language there it's

101
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:46,730
not my status

102
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:50,280
so I started pwned defend I obviously

103
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,330
play hack the box and I can try working

104
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:56,370
CTS and you know hacking all the things

105
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,920
is great and I decided to create

106
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,870
something I just started just to see if

107
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,880
anyone would play so I just built a

108
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,430
runnable web service and made a game box

109
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,680
but I thought I'd do it with twist I

110
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,480
wouldn't do it in an arena I thought I'd

111
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,580
do it just open on the internet and see

112
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,460
how long it took someone to bone it and

113
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,530
from there it really grew so people

114
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,310
started playing inside doing critic

115
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:22,440
conferences and really my idea here is

116
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,160
to bring real-world scenarios with real

117
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,100
well tap that you will see if you go

118
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,810
into the security if you work in

119
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,370
technology you'll see this stuff in

120
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,110
companies and I'm trying to bring that

121
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,900
into the CTF arena more so I'm trying to

122
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,450
bring stuff it's realistic but I'm also

123
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,040
trying to bring stuff into the arena

124
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,860
that means people who have any level of

125
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,840
skill can play I always see on Twitter

126
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,240
people say I don't look good enough to

127
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,000
play CGS everyone is good enough to play

128
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,970
the CTF until you play you won't be

129
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,800
learning these skills but they should

130
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,980
definitely a root to everyone so that's

131
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,050
why I create own defend in touch words

132
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:04,880
so far it's going pretty well

133
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,970
yeah but personally I think it's a huge

134
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,580
asset to the community so a big big

135
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,400
thank you for the work you've done let's

136
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,689
call this cold I mean the security

137
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:16,069
community is great I know there's a lot

138
00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:18,469
of drama on Twitter and it's very easy

139
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:20,389
to say something that offends someone or

140
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:21,860
or they get offended at being offended

141
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:29,270
or you know but there's so much good in

142
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,039
the community and the people are meeting

143
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,259
yourselves included but every day I

144
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:35,060
speak to someone new one of the things I

145
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,979
love about engaging online and through

146
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:39,889
the community space is if you don't give

147
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:41,629
you as an actor chamber any talk to

148
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:43,719
people it's a really a great place to

149
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:46,669
meet people to help people to learn from

150
00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:50,120
people but I've got a big network online

151
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,099
and we help each other and I think

152
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:53,599
that's something that gets lost in all

153
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,659
the number of followers or the dramas or

154
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:59,300
whatever fits going on in InfoSec

155
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,960
Twitter of the day but it's really ways

156
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,639
of making connections professionally

157
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,319
personally that can really help because

158
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,949
I think we're in an industry that is

159
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:11,840
really tough in the sense of it's so

160
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,039
broad it's so deep but everyone suffers

161
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:18,740
from impostor syndrome everyone realizes

162
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,629
the more they do the less they know and

163
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:24,949
we're in a sort of like a battling

164
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:27,020
position and I think that it's only free

165
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,360
we're working together as a team as a

166
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,310
community that you really managed to

167
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,930
overcome these things like it's

168
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,089
important that people know that they're

169
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:37,009
not meant to know everything they're not

170
00:07:37,009 --> 00:07:38,599
meant to do everything they're not meant

171
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:41,419
to be the best everything it's for a

172
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:45,229
team community that couldn't put it

173
00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:48,710
about myself actually you make a good

174
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:52,629
point and I watch you not in a weird way

175
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:55,430
but they watch you we shot quite a lot I

176
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:58,250
think it's fair to say and you kind of

177
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,169
cut through all the crap you just get on

178
00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:01,969
with it you know you've got a mission

179
00:08:01,969 --> 00:08:04,310
whether it's do nice ETFs whether it's

180
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:07,129
you know releasing videos about how to

181
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:09,080
defend or attack and all that kind of

182
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,120
stuff and you've seen your farmer

183
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,449
stirrings and that as well but you do

184
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:17,750
seem to have a an almost unique ability

185
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,420
to

186
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:22,950
just detach from all the crap and I mean

187
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,960
what we're all about so just explain to

188
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,850
people how you do that

189
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:28,890
I just thought blocking everyone that

190
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:34,980
talks [ __ ] I Spit AG is not blocking

191
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,650
anyone it takes a lot for me to block

192
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:42,299
someone um I I just could just try and

193
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:44,730
focus on what I'm doing professionally

194
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:48,060
as well as like with people and my days

195
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,220
as you can probably see from when I put

196
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,640
my frog morning world best years my days

197
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,530
are sometimes really though I get up

198
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:58,380
quite early I work a stupid number of

199
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,650
hours and I try and balance everything

200
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:07,620
badly and I think the Regis boy by

201
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,390
focusing on what you want to do and want

202
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,500
you're trying to get out of the world

203
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,460
and not focusing on the drama so much

204
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:17,310
and it really helps and like I said I

205
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,230
try not the echo chamber in Twitter

206
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,720
sometimes I go on massive rants or long

207
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,360
threads but I learn I try to engage with

208
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,770
people I actually want to talk to people

209
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,600
I want a conversation I don't just want

210
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,870
to share my opinion so that's what I

211
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,980
think I think it's more about

212
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,870
communicating with each other than it is

213
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,210
about communicating your point because I

214
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,680
I know every day that I learned

215
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,450
something I learned that I don't know

216
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:42,000
enough and I love learning

217
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,760
so the more I learned the more I know I

218
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,220
don't know anything the better I feel

219
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,840
about that effect because you have to

220
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,840
accept it I've been in the industry for

221
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,190
you know coming on to 20 years probably

222
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:56,070
and that doesn't include like my really

223
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:59,730
young days and I'm like well I don't

224
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,770
never gonna be the best that everything

225
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,170
in the world and that's okay but I'm

226
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,700
pretty good at what I do I love what I

227
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,180
do is great fun I love helping companies

228
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,030
I love helping people so if you take

229
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,680
that positive approach and trying to

230
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,720
apply that was pragmatically as possible

231
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,590
is the world is a [ __ ] place yeah and we

232
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,510
can't do everything can we right no

233
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:24,180
absolutely also everyone has a [ __ ]

234
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:24,780
opinion

235
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:28,020
right like you can post something where

236
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,580
you can talk to someone in a conference

237
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,649
or you can speak some in a meeting room

238
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:33,089
someone will say something about

239
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:35,160
technology which is right there right

240
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,059
you're wrong

241
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:37,889
yeah and that you just got to accept

242
00:10:37,889 --> 00:10:39,839
that that's the case and if you can have

243
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,269
debate with them getting to be more

244
00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:48,509
level-headed or you know like if it

245
00:10:48,509 --> 00:10:50,730
matters enough you can start arguing and

246
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:52,740
you can defend your position or you can

247
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,999
put you know whatever you need to do

248
00:10:53,999 --> 00:10:56,309
other time you just say well and he's

249
00:10:56,309 --> 00:10:58,019
just gonna moan any or he's gonna moan

250
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:00,209
anyway or they're just gonna have that

251
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:02,970
opinion or they love VMware or Microsoft

252
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:05,220
or they love penguins and it's like Co

253
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,259
you love penguins and you want penguins

254
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:08,910
used everywhere go ahead let's go I

255
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,949
don't really care as long as the tech

256
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:12,829
does well the business objective is and

257
00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:15,959
it's a doctor ball it's usable its

258
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:17,850
support of all and it fits within your

259
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,999
constraints I'm break over so yes try

260
00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:22,589
and take a bit of a level-headed view

261
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:24,199
you're never gonna achieve perfection

262
00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:26,429
I've had someone turn around to me

263
00:11:26,429 --> 00:11:28,649
before and say they want 100% security

264
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:31,589
and nearly fell on my [ __ ] ass yeah

265
00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:33,720
because it doesn't exist it doesn't

266
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,429
exist

267
00:11:34,429 --> 00:11:38,759
beware of security absolutism indeed I

268
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:42,209
wrote a blog about this which is quoting

269
00:11:42,209 --> 00:11:43,559
Star Wars which I'm probably now going

270
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:45,870
to misquote but only the safety and

271
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:48,569
absolutes and yeah and that's what we

272
00:11:48,569 --> 00:11:52,019
get if people are too too opinionated in

273
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:54,300
this space it's a real problem like it's

274
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,009
a problem for productivity it's a

275
00:11:56,009 --> 00:11:58,410
problem for a doctrine I mean the number

276
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,839
of people I speak to you think we all do

277
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:06,149
magic be speech [ __ ] yeah and they just

278
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:07,949
want to get on do their business and

279
00:12:07,949 --> 00:12:10,139
they one of them like you know they have

280
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:12,689
focuses it's not that people don't care

281
00:12:12,689 --> 00:12:15,689
about security it's just they care about

282
00:12:15,689 --> 00:12:18,269
other things as well so it's all about

283
00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:20,999
making sure you're mixing you know

284
00:12:20,999 --> 00:12:23,309
understanding requirements and mixing

285
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:24,809
your viewpoints and perspectives so that

286
00:12:24,809 --> 00:12:28,439
you can draw a full picture because some

287
00:12:28,439 --> 00:12:29,850
business models rely on certain things

288
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:33,360
happening and it's important to

289
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,559
understand business architecture

290
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:37,139
business drivers and business operating

291
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:39,449
models as well as all the zeros and ones

292
00:12:39,449 --> 00:12:42,839
and the you know the risk points the

293
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:44,910
vulnerabilities and all the crazy fit

294
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:47,670
see any computer yeah but in the end

295
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,310
we're mainly here and the me I'm

296
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,920
excluding some of the defense and

297
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,300
critical infrastructure stuff in this

298
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,610
but as the majority of people are

299
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,950
working in the commercial space they are

300
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:02,010
defending against commodity frets you

301
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,990
know you need to be pragmatic about what

302
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:07,050
you do I think you nail it they're

303
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,200
really down with the word pragmatism

304
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,150
yeah we we can't get everything we want

305
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,370
and we'll never nail on a percent

306
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,410
security and it's about picking your

307
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:19,170
battles using your time your resources

308
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:22,920
your people your expertise wisely to get

309
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,960
the right result and apply controls

310
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,480
where they're actually needed you know

311
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,180
that's incredibly important well it's

312
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,280
very hard to make every single take the

313
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,050
CIOs control set right it's a great

314
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:34,650
baseline

315
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:38,280
it's got you know thousands of seconds

316
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,950
in from memory yeah it's very difficult

317
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,830
to do everything like it's important to

318
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:46,790
pick what's important like the number of

319
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:49,080
organizations that you can walk into and

320
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,260
run responder and get I've userland

321
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,830
or domain admin it's not so it's like

322
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:58,080
when we start doing the Foundation's and

323
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,330
you can avoid the basic term but if we

324
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:01,950
can start working on the foundation that

325
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,720
we can start engaging with the business

326
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,630
if we can start having business language

327
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:09,480
conversations and implementing controls

328
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,510
that are adoptable that people can use

329
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,820
that are within the constraints of

330
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,070
budget resources skills training and all

331
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:18,900
the other pieces yeah you're going to

332
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,270
find your journeys a lot easier it's not

333
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,310
gonna say be easy because we are

334
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:27,090
essentially in a very hard space we've

335
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:29,130
got technology you deployed all over the

336
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,200
world there's you know most

337
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,700
organizations have got high technical

338
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,950
debt they've got weak security past

339
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:37,080
years and they've got quite a lot of

340
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,270
constraints yeah so it's about how do

341
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:42,060
you move in those bases and you move

342
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,210
well for communication

343
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:49,410
yeah very completely agree okay yeah I

344
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:52,770
hope you have a question down yes what's

345
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:56,110
it like to own a Ford Mondeo

346
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,790
it's funny because it's probably got

347
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,650
more Volvo components than it has

348
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:06,130
thought if the birds II don't ask them

349
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:09,460
was before Ford's part say masculine so

350
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:12,450
it's a bit of a joke with them if you

351
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:15,760
buy one of the coolest cars in emphasis

352
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,290
it's really nice when it when it doesn't

353
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,880
have any issues it's really nice when

354
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,230
you haven't got to pay for fuel so

355
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:29,050
everything insurance it's a cool car

356
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:31,300
right it's a I don't do a lot apart from

357
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,910
work I work spends whatever time I kind

358
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:36,160
of my family and then I like driving say

359
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,820
he said do you ever pretend to be James

360
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,310
Bond I've got the James Bond soundtrack

361
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,860
in the car

362
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,350
I think that though is not unique to me

363
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,210
I think quite a lot of the people I

364
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:51,910
speak to online especially those we

365
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:55,510
asked that Sunday hashtag they also have

366
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:58,870
a Bonfim in the car or do they it's

367
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,400
