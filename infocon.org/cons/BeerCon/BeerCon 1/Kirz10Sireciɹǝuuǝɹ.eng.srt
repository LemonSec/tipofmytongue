4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,510
accent you are apparently a programmer

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:25,439
turned a recruiter oh yeah this is super

6
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,529
cool because we we wonder about the

7
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:31,439
world of a per sec recruitment oh yes we

8
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,010
do oh how cool the industry is or is it

9
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,710
really [ __ ] easy

10
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,660
tell us about what you do okay so yeah I

11
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,170
started

12
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,879
I'll age myself it was mmm early mid 90s

13
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:49,410
I did a little bit application

14
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,800
programming and then I I found myself

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,579
doing ite standing up and running it

16
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:58,590
helped us a little bit for startups and

17
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,050
then for local government and then I

18
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,510
realized that what I was really good I

19
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,780
was building those chains more than more

20
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,460
than the technical stuff love the

21
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,049
technology and I still get to be

22
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:12,240
involved in it and a part of it because

23
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,880
I'm surrounded by it but recruiting is

24
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,450
when I'm really super good at um so now

25
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,630
I run recruiting team I retain team at a

26
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,180
technology company so that's that's who

27
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:24,450
I am

28
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,250
I don't care if you call me Karen or

29
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,290
everybody at conferences either calls me

30
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,270
Crenna or car hacking person girl

31
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,790
whatever but my name is actually

32
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,509
pronounced Kirsten and people write but

33
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:39,689
that's who I am and and I'm a Saints fan

34
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:44,909
who dad what's up Bri alright Kirsten

35
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:48,390
cool great intro so you were a

36
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,189
programmer back in the day and you eat

37
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:51,840
it's a candy dude sack and you are a

38
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,720
techie person so how he found moving out

39
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,259
one realm and into another one and how

40
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,590
is the one thing helping me doing it I

41
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:05,490
think it's very important for recruiters

42
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,280
to to make themselves knowledgeable if

43
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,140
they didn't come in with any technology

44
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,959
and I trained my recruiters one of them

45
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:17,700
just went and got a double us-cert and

46
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:23,130
reinvent so it doesn't mean that I can

47
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,630
sit down and do all the things that you

48
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:28,050
guys can do right or the technical

49
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,920
people can do [ __ ] I was programming in

50
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,109
Visual Basic like a million years ago

51
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,150
but I think it's very important to

52
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,230
understand what you what you're

53
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,550
recruiting for at the end of the day

54
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:45,209
could I recruit in healthcare yes kind

55
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:48,510
of recruit in I don't know construction

56
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:53,220
probably but I want to do I want it to

57
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,360
be something that I'm passionate about

58
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,100
and as far as our community goes I've

59
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,410
been listening to each of the not all of

60
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,540
them but a few of the sessions up to

61
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,370
this point we're trying to slow down on

62
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,720
my drinking so I can stay awake for

63
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,900
[Music]

64
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,870
listening to what you're saying and

65
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,060
noticing you know I'm on Twitter all the

66
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,140
time and I want to tell you what I was

67
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,480
going to talk about and how Twitter

68
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,400
changed my mind at 3 o'clock this

69
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,660
morning my time the technology because

70
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,790
if you're not sleeping and who sleeps

71
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,359
right and and you're out of wine what do

72
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:36,600
you do on Twitter might you just get on

73
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,940
Twitter yeah you punch is you for waking

74
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:47,220
him up but I saw a post will be back up

75
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,170
what I was gonna talk about is I was

76
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:52,440
just gonna do like I talked to six or

77
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,450
seven recruiters I said hey tell me here

78
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,760
your best and worst candidate

79
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,350
experiences and this is gonna be very

80
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,000
entertaining right I'm gonna tell you

81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,989
guys these great stories and then as I

82
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:06,329
started to collect those stories from

83
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,730
them I realized that's not helpful at

84
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11,010
all right because if I tell the story

85
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:15,209
about you should never show up drunk or

86
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:16,858
you should matter

87
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:19,180
well you should only flip over the desk

88
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,560
if you're interviewing for the WWF but

89
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,960
that's not helpful it's it's trash right

90
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,870
it's like click so I said I'm gonna do

91
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,360
better than that and I hope I pronounce

92
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,050
her name correctly

93
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,330
Alyssa who's actually coming up here

94
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:37,979
after me here or tomorrow morning yes

95
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:40,870
yeah she's in that she's in the room and

96
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,639
I want to shout out one thing

97
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,969
besides that her tweet prompted what I'm

98
00:04:45,969 --> 00:04:48,009
about to speak about and sorry I'm

99
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:49,539
Italian I just go off in a lot of

100
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,860
directions I hope you can follow them

101
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,750
okay

102
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:59,830
shout out she just did a article on

103
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,629
LinkedIn you should all look at it and

104
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:03,250
read it it's about leadership and it's

105
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,909
one of the most poignant things I've

106
00:05:06,909 --> 00:05:08,469
ever read about leadership it really

107
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:10,990
struck me and I've been reflecting on it

108
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,550
trying to be a better leader based on

109
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,960
what she said someone see that real

110
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,150
quick but good thing last night and I

111
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,270
believe the original she wasn't the

112
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,759
original tweet I want to give credit to

113
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,710
the person who did it I wrote it down

114
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,750
but I can't find it it was about

115
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,509
horrible job descriptions it was a

116
00:05:28,509 --> 00:05:31,089
screenshot of a job description that

117
00:05:31,089 --> 00:05:34,180
listed I'm not kidding you 30 and

118
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,639
requirements they didn't say preferences

119
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,740
they didn't say was that was that the

120
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,240
Sony architecture one pick widely

121
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:54,629
lampooned by the entire community the

122
00:05:54,629 --> 00:06:01,180
company redacted what I want to walk you

123
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:04,830
through is in my opinion and experience

124
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:08,229
how does this happen I have two theories

125
00:06:08,229 --> 00:06:11,259
and what should you do about it

126
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:14,889
how should you respond so do you have

127
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:19,689
any any questions first before no lay it

128
00:06:19,689 --> 00:06:25,959
on us okay I haven't heard any clicking

129
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:28,870
of beer cans tabs opening in the last

130
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:31,709
few minutes

131
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:41,550
it sounded like the French Revolution

132
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:47,530
I'm gonna take you to before I got into

133
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:51,820
info sack recruiting at about the year

134
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:56,170
2000 and it did have some examples that

135
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:59,080
that I thought maybe would be

136
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,730
interesting decides flipping over tables

137
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,950
from being drunk let me just say one

138
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,020
thing you shouldn't do and then I'll get

139
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,620
to the to the job postings the only

140
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,960
example I wanted to point out and I

141
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,030
don't think very many normal non

142
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:17,260
sociopathic humans would do this but you

143
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,330
can do variations of this there was a

144
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:22,900
person this was my very first Def Con

145
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:28,420
back oh my god mm it was 10 years ago or

146
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:33,310
more and I was brand new I was a baby I

147
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,960
didn't know anything I didn't I didn't

148
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,210
yeah I was like they threw me right in

149
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:40,090
the pool and I had my personal cell

150
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:42,730
phone number on my business cards you

151
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:45,810
know that's how much of a kid I was and

152
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:49,170
came home after after it was all over

153
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:52,090
started getting text messages from this

154
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:55,180
person who wanted to be a candidate to

155
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,130
one of the positions that I had posted

156
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:00,150
on my company's website at the time and

157
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:05,860
wanted I guess to impress me by talking

158
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,320
about and sending screenshots and

159
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,980
excerpts from domestic case files from

160
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:15,850
my personal past from a very dark time

161
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:21,010
in my past and that's pretty awful so

162
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:24,190
let me just say free pointer to the

163
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:27,130
universe if you're capable of doing dark

164
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:32,229
creepy things find a better way to let

165
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:35,650
people know so that was um I don't think

166
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:36,820
it ended up working out very well for

167
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,250
that individual but that was my worst

168
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,320
candidate story

169
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:46,329
mmm just shocked you know like that it's

170
00:08:46,329 --> 00:08:49,410
just beyond like how do people really

171
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:52,389
work that I get if you're critical about

172
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:53,980
a job description I get if you're

173
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,320
critical about you know maybe the way

174
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,600
the company treated you or their process

175
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,990
but to then kind of go to that dark

176
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:05,500
place of like stalking or or you know

177
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,480
making a person feel very uncomfortable

178
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,500
or unsafe just what is the mental you

179
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,740
know process there you know what and

180
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,709
guess what person that doesn't even make

181
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:20,470
you a hacker no I know all the best

182
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,339
hackers in the world

183
00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:23,529
that's not hacking that's super googling

184
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:25,720
that's cheap and gross right those types

185
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,850
of records if you really wanted to

186
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,500
figure out where I used to live and

187
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,019
they're all there are public records if

188
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:34,750
you really wait weird and bored um so

189
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,769
that didn't even it wasn't even

190
00:09:35,769 --> 00:09:38,560
impressive it's just creepy I don't know

191
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,569
what I don't know how that happens I I

192
00:09:40,569 --> 00:09:44,500
feel very badly when I see people having

193
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,319
bad experiences it's it's it's why I

194
00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:49,029
volunteer it's why I speak at

195
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:51,550
conferences it's why I train people how

196
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,529
to interview and how to write their

197
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:55,209
resume so that they'll have a better

198
00:09:55,209 --> 00:09:57,699
experience it's why I try to make my

199
00:09:57,699 --> 00:10:00,550
recruiters better to close the gap in

200
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:03,490
this process and make it less awful hey

201
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:09,130
not every recruiter sucks for you

202
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:11,250
Kirsten

203
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:16,000
LinkedIn yeah okay so a lot of people in

204
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,029
industry general whatever the you know

205
00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:21,819
the mission that we're in tends to be

206
00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:24,160
approached by people in LinkedIn

207
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,260
recruitment companies and recruiters and

208
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:29,529
all that kind of stuff yeah and I get a

209
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:31,959
lot and I'm guessing a lot of other

210
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:35,319
people get the same thing I saw in a

211
00:10:35,319 --> 00:10:39,360
database the word Salesforce

212
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:44,389
your name next to it me No No maybe so

213
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:46,680
so here's a job that you may be

214
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,540
interested in because it's got the word

215
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,569
Salesforce that was a database match and

216
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:54,839
all that kind of [ __ ] yeah or a very

217
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:58,110
formulated template approach that says

218
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:01,709
we have a job and your profile seems to

219
00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:05,040
fit it perfectly yeah and then I look

220
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,300
and it's not even close to what I do

221
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:12,839
Executive believably any and then you

222
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,870
know the other weirdness is like a

223
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,639
recruiter hits you up for an

224
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:21,809
introduction to somebody else and I'm

225
00:11:21,809 --> 00:11:26,370
just like I don't get it like geez I

226
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:28,649
should have prefaced with I want to make

227
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:34,290
a blanket apology it is not your fault

228
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:44,009
you're one of the good ones I'm sure I

229
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:50,610
did you know I reached out to a systems

230
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,620
engineer and said do you want a program

231
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,120
in Java or something stupid like that

232
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,240
that was Sean right Zach I've got the

233
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,639
best one I had a recruiter reach out to

234
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,319
me asking if I was interested in a job

235
00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:05,490
fine

236
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:08,100
java web development fine I was doing

237
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,170
all of that except for was the same

238
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:20,519
company in the same role so these train

239
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:30,929
wreck stories but I wish we had ours I'm

240
00:12:30,929 --> 00:12:32,339
ready to take the punches right I'm

241
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:33,629
ready to have people throw tomatoes at

242
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:35,309
me I would get up on the stage and every

243
00:12:35,309 --> 00:12:37,769
graze her hand and complain and and I

244
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:40,559
feel horrible because I want to solve it

245
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,809
I really do I was you know that little

246
00:12:42,809 --> 00:12:46,910
kid running around trying to fix things

247
00:12:46,939 --> 00:12:50,040
yeah I guess that's called social

248
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,170
justice warrior now that's awesome

249
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:57,629
though no that is true and I do want

250
00:12:57,629 --> 00:12:59,550
people to understand and I'm gonna

251
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:03,149
mention LinkedIn in my solution to this

252
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,939
wretched Job Description it had I think

253
00:13:05,939 --> 00:13:09,199
43 requirements there's two different

254
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:11,850
reasons but right off the top of my head

255
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,800
I can think of why a Job Description

256
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,370
would be that awful so one of them is

257
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:20,420
gonna be because it was written

258
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,519
specifically for and my company doesn't

259
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,850
do this we are in legit shop but back in

260
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,319
the day when I did telecommunications

261
00:13:28,319 --> 00:13:32,959
before as a sec a lot of the candidates

262
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,649
required a sponsorship for a visa right

263
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:40,290
so let's just say a person who's a

264
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:42,899
perfect fit who could do this this is

265
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:46,610
back in the day now work with me like 3G

266
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:49,439
ETL whatever whatever eyes this is could

267
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:53,550
climb towers in CDMA right so here

268
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,740
there's this candidate and they need an

269
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,199
h-1b and so I have to file for that so I

270
00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:00,779
have to follow the rules and post the

271
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:02,069
general up and leave it open for

272
00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:03,899
whatever this whatever the stated number

273
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:05,870
of days is let's just pretend it's 5:00

274
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:09,120
to have the job open so I'm gonna very

275
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,519
creatively write that Job Description in

276
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,379
such a way that it is sure fit for this

277
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:19,529
person and a lot of other people won't

278
00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:21,209
necessarily apply to it because it's

279
00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:24,569
awful and let's just say I'm going okay

280
00:14:24,569 --> 00:14:27,180
he's posting this job I know exactly who

281
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,160
I want to hire but I have to post it I'm

282
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,660
gonna have to prove that I followed a

283
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,790
competitive process and was being fair

284
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,949
I wasn't discriminating against people

285
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:37,949
who aren't this person in case there are

286
00:14:37,949 --> 00:14:40,079
some protective factor other than this

287
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,139
person and let's just face it that

288
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:44,970
person just statistically speaking is

289
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:46,649
probably a white guy

290
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:50,279
it isn't that right and I'm pleased

291
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:51,749
everyone who isn't a white guy don't get

292
00:14:51,749 --> 00:14:53,870
mad at me it's just it's just statistics

293
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:58,580
so if you if you aren't that /

294
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,470
and I write the Job Description and I

295
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,180
say okay I want you to have my what can

296
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:07,070
I think of a cissp and a PhD and three

297
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:12,830
years of La Crosse Crossing college wink

298
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:17,570
wink he's gonna get the job and everyone

299
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:19,459
else is gonna be angry here's how and

300
00:15:19,459 --> 00:15:22,430
there's another reason why some job

301
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,230
descriptions are terrible this is

302
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,540
probably way more likely the case in

303
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,130
fact when I looked at the one last night

304
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,510
on Twitter and you can look at Alyssa's

305
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,850
page my page and I'll find this other

306
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:35,000
guy's name originally posted it and I'm

307
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,740
gonna write this whole thing up and turn

308
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,360
it into a blog and post it for everyone

309
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,550
because pregnant amount of time but the

310
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,220
other reason is going to be straight-up

311
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,990
administrative errors my company's only

312
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,910
have thousand people we've got like

313
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,310
hundreds of jobs open so think of the

314
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:51,500
huge companies that have thousands of

315
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,070
jobs open they're really not paying

316
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,570
close attention and they could be an

317
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,570
administrative error it could be a

318
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:01,339
misunderstanding it could be I've seen

319
00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:02,930
this happen before when the applicant

320
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:05,510
tracking system some horrible applicant

321
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,850
tracking system that was written in 1984

322
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:10,970
in takes the position descriptions and

323
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,870
reformats them and takes all of the

324
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:17,029
subtext makes them in bullets now it

325
00:16:17,029 --> 00:16:18,890
looks like there's 50 requirements when

326
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,779
a lot of those were only preferences and

327
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:22,579
the job description is horrible and

328

00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:27,950
probably devastated if he knew why

355
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,690
requirements I'm hoping that there's

356
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,220
some flexibility there I don't really

357
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,860
have lacrosse experience I don't really

358
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:43,420

you're gonna go back to LinkedIn and

00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,710
the VP of the solutions architecture

365
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:06,040
division where this job likely rests and

366
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,100
you're gonna say hi sorry to bother you

367
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,740
marry the director I I noticed this and

368
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,180
really excited and really interested in

369
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,530
maybe Bartholomew hasn't gotten around

370
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:16,900
to his messages yet and I understand but

371
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,450
I'm super eager and please take a look

372
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:21,700
at my profile and here's what I'm gonna

373
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,230
promise at the whole world however many

374
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,550
people are on right now

375
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:27,730
you can quote me if you don't get a

376
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:32,380
response I will buy you a beer wow this

377
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:42,550
is C at DEFCON do you think there's

378
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:45,730
another reason perhaps and that's just

379
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:48,460
simply that those placed in the job just

380
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,410
don't know what their wines or what they

381
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:54,430
even looking for I think it's very like

382
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,560
I said there could be a misunderstanding

383
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,380
but I feel like there couldn't there

384
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,240
isn't likely cash I hope there isn't

385
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,700
such a disconnect in between the person

386
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,190
who wants to fill the job and they know

387
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:08,170
what their customer wants don't get me

388
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:08,580
wrong

389
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:12,100
most of my end customers are the US

390
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,830
government and wash pick you're going to

391
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:19,570
say sometimes delete all that the end

392
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:22,129
customers

393
00:19:22,129 --> 00:19:24,659
sometimes the end customer changes their

394
00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:27,570
mind frequently so that happens it

395
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,549
really really does you're out there

396
00:19:29,549 --> 00:19:30,929
you're there you're the recruiter or

397
00:19:30,929 --> 00:19:32,729
you're the manager and you think you

398
00:19:32,729 --> 00:19:35,429
know what they want and then they change

399
00:19:35,429 --> 00:19:38,159
their mind or they completely change the

400
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:39,479
requirements they change the location

401
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:43,139
they change the tools that you need

402
00:19:43,139 --> 00:19:45,809
everything so that happens and in those

403
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,309
cases maybe they're trying to cover all

404
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:49,289
the ground and that's why they put that

405
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:52,739
many things on there but they should all

406
00:19:52,739 --> 00:19:54,869
the potential employers should clean up

407
00:19:54,869 --> 00:19:56,879
the job descriptions they really should

408
00:19:56,879 --> 00:19:58,919
and you have to get through all these

409
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:00,209
hurdles you have to get through these

410
00:20:00,209 --> 00:20:02,700
awful job descriptions and resume the

411
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,039
application process the interview

412
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,499
process getting getting dropped on

413
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:11,149
accident you know going getting ghosted

414
00:20:11,149 --> 00:20:13,320
there's so many girls you have to get

415
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,719
through the best way to do it is what

416
00:20:15,719 --> 00:20:17,849
we're doing right now networking and

417
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:20,299
communicating being at conferences

418
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:22,739
communicating with each other on social

419
00:20:22,739 --> 00:20:24,539
I have to say I appreciate what you said

420
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:27,119
about how we stand up to each other for

421
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:29,879
each other yeah there's been fighting

422
00:20:29,879 --> 00:20:33,959
yeah there's issues this community has

423
00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:36,179
been so there for me like I can't even

424
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:39,809
tell you oh yeah giving me opportunities

425
00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:42,839

426
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:44,459
couple of weeks ago and everybody kind

427
00:20:44,459 --> 00:20:47,759
of rallied together and raised money for

428
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:51,809
my family like it's amazing it's it's

429
00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:54,119
mostly overall very good and because

430
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:56,429
it's good I can care about it so much

431
00:20:56,429 --> 00:21:00,589
