1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,750
we're going to now move to Kaitlyn

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,620
Bowden and Jamie Duxbury what we need

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,980
here to do is we're doubling up because

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,400
there's a couple of sessions here

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,980
back-to-back that we want to get in as

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,570
many people as we can it just seemed

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,730
that this time was a very popular time

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,580
so good morning to you Kaitlyn and good

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,130
morning to you Jamie

10
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:32,308
good morning and do we have Kaitlyn on

11
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:37,590
line we see her but we don't hear her

12
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:45,719
yet perfect okay can you hear me now we

13
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,550
certainly can wonderful

14
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,829
Kaitlyn thank you so much and Jamie

15
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:51,660
thank you so much I know we're we're

16
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,579
doubling up a little bit but let's start

17
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:56,760
with you Kaitlyn the badass army has

18
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,309
come out of nowhere and it's been a huge

19
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:04,170
impact again hailing from Ohio which

20
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,680
seems to be a hotbed of cyber security

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,960
these days tell us a little bit about

22
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,290
that project well it started a couple

23
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,680
years ago I found myself a victim of my

24
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,630
images being shared online and I

25
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:19,799
discovered that there weren't really

26
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,439
that many resources for this sort of

27
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:25,170
thing and I started reaching out to

28
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,000
other victims just in the hopes that we

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,180
could you know combine forces and maybe

30
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,520
just get something done and I don't know

31
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,920
exactly what we've done this but it has

32
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,710
been working well I think I think you're

33
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,560
underselling it completely because am I

34
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,390
to understand that there are now some

35
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,600
state laws either enacted or in

36
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,430
consideration to deal with the issue of

37
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,979
revenge part we have gotten a couple

38
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:52,200
state laws passed on stir

39
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,140
uh-huh oh hi oh has one now thanks to us

40
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,540
a badass did a lot of work out in

41
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,170
Montana

42
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,920
getting that law into place and we are

43
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,990
working on a federal law that would help

44
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,969
bridge the gaps between the state laws

45
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:09,119
and pick up where they are you know

46
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,200
leaving victims that's fantast

47
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,810
and I wish you all the luck and effort

48
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,960
on that on that I guess the question is

49
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,080
is he taken a very in-your-face

50
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,330
controversial some would say approach to

51
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:26,120
dealing with this issue was there a

52
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,380
reason for for that aggression because

53
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,050
it seems like the soft sell was not

54
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:38,240
working um no it was just me being me I

55
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,770
don't really know how to do anything

56
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:44,090
except be myself and frankly I was

57
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,300
really pissed off I mean I think most of

58
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,450
us in that situation would be so I'm

59
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,980
gonna be a little bit more aggressive

60
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,590
about it because I was sick of everybody

61
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,740
just letting it be swept under the rug

62
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:00,290
right right and it's such a huge

63
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:03,950
invasion and you you you're not really

64
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,530
are you and see I don't know about this

65
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,750
because I just sort of see the badass or

66
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,210
me and see what they're doing are you

67
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,190
new to information security have you

68
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,230
been in the industry for a while or what

69
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:18,050
is sort of the person behind this um I

70
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:21,680
was a bartender oh I am brand-new to

71
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,290
information security I'm not a highly

72
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,240
technical person

73
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,890
what I am good at is community

74
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:34,250
organizing and I know enough to get by

75
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:38,180
on the tech but I can't code a line I am

76
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:42,650
media WordPress anybody that can but

77
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,810
what I deal with mostly is going to be

78
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,000
end-user security and making sure that

79
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,360
everyday users people who you know don't

80
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,560
know their exits from their VPN that

81
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,840
they are staying secure and making sure

82
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,470
that their privacy is protected as well

83
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,700
as letting them know what their rights

84
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,660
are as far as their privacy yeah well I

85
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,180
I kind of want to draw Jamie into the

86
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,430
conversation a little bit here just so

87
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,220
that you know it's not totally one-sided

88
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,399
Jamie absolutely are you you're sitting

89
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,470
there you're listening to this strong

90
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,839
advocacy someone new and infamy

91
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:23,180
security now you've been in information

92
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,460
security for for a while for forever

93
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,780
what are usually some of your thoughts

94
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,750
of dealing with this problem and getting

95
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,660
the end users to to pay attention to the

96
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,139
consequences and issues it's it's we

97
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:41,180
live in we live in the modern world

98
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,960
where the Internet doesn't forget easily

99
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,139
the days of innocence and the blissful

100
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:50,030
days where we could post things say

101
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:53,030
things do things and people would forget

102
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:56,000
our embarrassment that those days are

103
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,139
long gone

104
00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:00,200
the entire arena of sharing images or

105
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,270
sharing intimate things and then having

106
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,160
that published elsewhere or shared

107
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,820
elsewhere

108
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:08,000
it's the extreme age isn't it it's the

109
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,110
toxic world and it's also even 40 then

110
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:15,830
requires caitlyn and people to then turn

111
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,229
the tables on those people those those

112
00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:21,680
so those miss endeavors or those those

113
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,600
innocent people finding out the hard way

114
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,320
that the internet has got a long memory

115
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,180
the education piece vote for myself is

116
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,030
just as important as kind of trying to

117
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,520
fix the problem matter after it's it's

118
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,160
out in public people need to understand

119
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,320
that sharing an innocent or a kind of

120
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,419
risque picture between you know between

121
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:44,570
your most confided a liar your partner

122
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,940
can have long consequences if your phone

123
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,320
is compromised if your pictures are

124
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:48,979
compromised

125
00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:52,130
it's the shocking reality that people

126
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,260
have lost the innocence of sharing

127
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,080
intimate images or intimate things with

128
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,860
other partners it's a scary world we

129
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,139
live in but unfortunately Katie you're

130
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:04,729
you know you're filling a gap though

131
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:07,190
that it's this is sad but we need to

132
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,220
have that people out there and powering

133
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,840
people to fight back in order to call

134
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,630
back those images and to to provide some

135
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,669
support some help because there isn't

136
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:17,330
anything else

137
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:20,360
so you fill the void that unfortunately

138
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,849
sadly needed it would be significant the

139
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:25,280
time we live in so good for you well

140
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,130
today I agree so much with that and I

141
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,560
think Caitlyn may be can you tell us a

142
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,620
story of a recent success where

143
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,130
a perpetrator of revenge porn was

144
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,669
brought to justice

145
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,780
you

146
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:50,289
okay I hope you're there

147
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:58,490
oh there we go we've had a lot of really

148
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:01,420
great successes with our civil lawsuits

149
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,150
where they're suing for money well sadly

150
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:08,270
our criminal lawsuits have not gone over

151
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,480
extremely well there's a lot of issues

152
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,250
with the laws we have to prove intent

153
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,290
which makes them really hard to

154
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:20,150
prosecute we have had a case that we've

155
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,670
been working on for about two years that

156
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:25,700
is a good friend of mine whose pictures

157
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,990
have been out there for about ten years

158
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:27,680
now

159
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,990
Wow and we have been working to catch

160
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,430
this guy he was he's been sharing

161
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:40,370
underaged images of teens and we had to

162
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,290
teach the police how to use discord we

163
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,940
had to really walk them through every

164
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,420
step of evidence collection and he was

165
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,700
arrested and he's actually being charged

166
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:54,440
with a lot of counts of sharing child

167
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,920
pornography and it's interesting the way

168
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,920
that we handled it differently than how

169
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,440
the police normally do we actually were

170
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,370
there for the the when they did

171
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:10,340
discovery and went through his devices

172
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,340
and we but we um identified all the

173
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,190
victims and then we contacted contacted

174
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,040
them rather than having police do it

175
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,790
yesterday as a result he's we have more

176
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:25,760
victims coming forward in this case then

177
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,460
there has been in a really really long

178
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,160
time that's kind of hacking the system

179
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,070
in a lot of ways mm-hmm I mean it's all

180
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,919
about the approach it's gonna go over a

181
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,360
lot easier when it's somebody that

182
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,479
understands what you're going through

183
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,799
contacting you and saying hey we have an

184
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,179
opportunity to give you some justice

185
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:46,730
rather than having a uniformed officers

186
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:50,090
show up at their house right right tell

187
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,010
me a little bit about the civil action

188
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,380
because that might be something that a

189
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,920
lot of our UK listeners would be

190
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,389
unfamiliar with ok the civil action is

191
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:05,579
normally it would take a victim hiring a

192
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:08,519
lawyer and you know obviously suing them

193
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:11,670
for defamation for you know if there is

194
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:14,040
a civil tort written into their state

195
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,610
law and we have had some luck with that

196
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,370
what we do is we work with lawyers that

197
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:23,309
will work to pro bono cases or on

198
00:09:23,309 --> 00:09:25,499
contingency meaning they just get a

199
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:28,319
portion of the winnings in the event the

200
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:31,410
case goes well and we've had a lot of

201
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:34,079
success with that I don't want to name

202
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:35,490
dollar amount of course not

203
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:37,290
yeah sometimes you do want to punish

204
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:39,709
them by hitting their pockets

205
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:42,329
nationalisms of the victim and you know

206
00:09:42,329 --> 00:09:44,910
the lawyer takes a percentage but we try

207
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,759
to cover their costs whenever possible

208
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:50,329
that's great so Jamie in your in your

209
00:09:50,329 --> 00:09:54,029
security career have you been involved

210
00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:58,999
in investigations and a digital work

211
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:01,980
unfortunately quite a lot my career was

212
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,569
spent working with Tier one ISPs it's in

213
00:10:06,569 --> 00:10:08,550
the obviously the form to early days of

214
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:11,399
the Internet unfortunately high speed

215
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:13,319
internet connections tend to gravitate

216
00:10:13,319 --> 00:10:18,509
all Wakeeney the more less savory type

217
00:10:18,509 --> 00:10:21,509
so unfortunately my career I've already

218
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:23,819
been involved in at least three separate

219
00:10:23,819 --> 00:10:26,360
investigations with work colleagues

220
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,860
basically associated for child born and

221
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:32,579
hosting not for actually creating images

222
00:10:32,579 --> 00:10:36,059
but for hosting and inquiring and it's

223
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:39,420
as I say as now as a parent it's the

224
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,759
most invasive and scary thing to have

225
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:43,649
you know literally somebody that we work

226
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:46,470
with not necessarily closely to then to

227
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,999
be disciplined by the police and then go

228
00:10:47,999 --> 00:10:49,459
through the entire investigative piece

229
00:10:49,459 --> 00:10:53,100
as some jaitley was saying to scary is

230
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,809
the fact the police are not necessarily

231
00:10:54,809 --> 00:10:56,939
keeping up with the entire volume of

232
00:10:56,939 --> 00:10:59,220
media that's being produced so you know

233
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,519
a typical typical house will have no one

234
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:03,929
could gigabytes of day so we're dealing

235
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:06,269
with terrorized terabytes of data a lot

236
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:08,309
of its encrypted and the police are not

237
00:11:08,309 --> 00:11:10,620
necessarily keeping up with being able

238
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,929
to actually filter through an HD that

239
00:11:12,929 --> 00:11:14,699
they can acquire the images and acquired

240
00:11:14,699 --> 00:11:15,420
for

241
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,800
dataset images but they're not

242
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,600
necessarily processing those images or

243
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,910
breaking encryption so that the weight

244
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,500
of data being captured in any

245
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,110
investigation is increasing tenfold and

246
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,120
beyond and I don't think need that don't

247
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,010
think the technology's keeping up from

248
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:30,780
the law enforcement side in order to

249
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,150
help the system to actually bring people

250
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,100
to justice in a timely fashion so

251
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,140
keeping your against with the work that

252
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,090
you're doing to actually assist that law

253
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:41,310
enforcement to the u.s. it's fantastic

254
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,690
it seats training them and actually

255
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:45,360
improving their capability in order to

256
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,430
help more people in absolute extra pain

257
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:50,760
what we preserve to charge thank you

258
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,580
we're doing our best over in the UK you

259
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,800
guys have a lot more resources than we

260
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,220
do

261
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,860
there's the revenge porn hotline I know

262
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,200
there's a lot of legal representatives

263
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,910
there's an entire legal group dedicated

264
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:06,270
to fighting this sort of thing at

265
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,520
revenge porn lawyers there's a lot of

266
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,940
other groups in orange like mine doing

267
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,550
great work we just happen to focus more

268
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:17,400
on the tech side dodge and victim

269
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,100
advocacy a lot of the other orgs mostly

270
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:24,930
just focus on the legal so I and I want

271
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:27,810
to get back to that what sort of advice

272
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,700
do you have for young ladies and young

273
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:34,250
men that may want to share intimate

274
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,200
pictures I mean you know there was that

275
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,480
controversial statement I think it was

276
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,500
Nancy Pelosi maybe that said that you

277
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,690
know you just shouldn't share it or

278
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:47,220
maybe it was on the view I can't

279
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:50,460
remember but that's not a reality in the

280
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,980
way the youth are communicating today

281
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,370
right yes absolutely and it's not just

282
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:58,230
the youth it's everybody's relying more

283
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,090
and more on technology to foster their

284
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:03,780
relationships and what we recommend is

285
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,490
one you want to make sure that you're

286
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,680
sending it to somebody that you trust

287
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,690
if somebody's pressuring you to do

288
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:10,710
something and you're not comfortable

289
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,860
with it they don't deserve your news

290
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,900
basic agency and consent are really

291
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,490
important things and something you want

292
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,860
to take into account before you allow

293
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,320
somebody that kind of vulnerability yeah

294
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,330
the other thing we do recommend is

295
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:27,150
watermarking your images with the name

296
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:29,910
the recipients that way if they are

297
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:33,270
leaked it one you know who did it into

298
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,700
it also puts the onus and responsibility

299
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,080
on them to make sure that it stays

300
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,589
secure good plan and also you want to

301
00:13:40,589 --> 00:13:42,360
keep your pictures out of your camera

302
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,520
roll you want to keep them in a private

303
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,490
other you know area because the first if

304
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:48,960
somebody gets a hold of your phone the

305
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,220
first thing they're gonna look for it

306
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,860
there that kind of person is your camera

307
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,560
roll so using an app that I personally

308
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,800
use keep safe but there are several

309
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,960
other apps that you can use that can

310
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,160
safely and securely search store images

311
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,670
and remote wipe get good one as well

312
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:11,430
that is very important basic

313
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,100
cybersecurity measures that we recommend

314
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,950
for all users need to be put into place

315
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,980
you know secure passwords using password

316
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:23,670
managers two-factor authentication these

317
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,680
are all things that you know we don't

318
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,980
think twice about using but the end-user

319
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:31,350
you know as somebody's grandma not that

320
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,700
they might have needs but you know what

321
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,640
I mean somebody's grandma or just the

322
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,040
typical high school girl using tik-tok

323
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,600
and things like that they might not

324
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,120
think of these things and it's my job to

325
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,920
remind them of the consequences if they

326
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,220
don't

327
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,589
Jamie that's interesting you know that

328
00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:48,930
Caitlyn and really personalizing the

329
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,690
issue for users do you think maybe we're

330
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,610
not doing that enough in our sort of

331
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:56,400
annual security awareness training that

332
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,959
we're not really talking about that

333
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:00,779
threat model are we I think I think

334
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:02,370
again it goes back to security awareness

335
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:04,380
and it's more of a holistic approach so

336
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:07,529
so I think it's all part of the of rich

337
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:09,930
tapestry so in itself you know showing

338
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:12,810
images it shouldn't necessarily be you

339
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:14,730
know Aikido a cornerstone of anything

340
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:17,370
but for younger people it's really key

341
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:20,520
as part of a security policy or security

342
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,660
framework it's less important I think a

343
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,980
corporate policy doesn't need care about

344
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,500
showing intimate images however people

345
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,209
need to general awareness with what can

346
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:32,550
happen and go back to the technology and

347
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,810
war smokey I think that's a great idea

348
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:36,089
but I don't know of any applications

349
00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:36,790
that rewards

350
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:39,790
market and again I'm I'm an old grumpy

351
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,830
person so you know nobody wants to see

352
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,210
new pictures of me and I can't imagine

353
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,700
that the pressure to be placed with a

354
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,530
third party in order to send you know

355
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,710
risque or nude pictures it gives what -

356
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,210
Pandora's box when those pictures are

357
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,560
out there out this very it's very

358
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,170
difficult to to maintain or manage them

359
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:58,390
out of the event and peopled admit it's

360
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,640
the awareness piece to understand if you

361
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,320
do something on the internet you say

362
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,090
something on the internet it's very

363
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:06,070
difficult to retrieve it or to turn it

364
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,980
around or to to you know to get rid of

365
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:12,070
that evidential the trail you may have I

366
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,810
posted a picture of me nobody won't see

367
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:16,060
that but it's out though it's going to

368
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,210
be there is captured is cached so

369
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,590
understanding that the repercussions are

370
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:22,480
with us in a corporate workplace ending

371
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,270
at an eternal document over and trusted

372
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,970
be emailed to a third party or sending a

373
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,830
picture that you wouldn't necessarily

374
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:32,110
want your neighbors or your mother or

375
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:34,630
your friends to see over you is having

376
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,700
that awareness of the repercussions what

377
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,670
can happen yeah I think but I think

378
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:44,020
that's more of a societal issue than it

379
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,120
is you know just don't take the pictures

380
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,550
rightly sauce maybe it's also the modern

381
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,560
gratification people expect you know you

382
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,270
could you know with two clicks you can

383
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,430
go to our hardcore porn site so people

384
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,350
just expect that instant gratification

385
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,720
if you know I'm going along you know

386
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,190
I've been married for twenty plus years

387
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:02,770
what quite happy talk to see pictures of

388
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:05,310
each other you know it's new

389
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:08,770
gratification and risque pictures you

390
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,839
know a smiling picture of a friend space

391
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:13,359
is much nicer than you know a full

392
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,089
frontal nude shot I'm gonna place and

393
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:18,910
people need to remember you know who do

394
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,680
you know nobody wants to see me naked

395
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,770
for that sake but you know a risque

396
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,359
pictures of risque Patriot so it's

397
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,890
difficult you know they're different

398
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:29,620
wells the beer farmers beg to differ I

399
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,690
think our new policy is going to be is

400
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:34,230
your sensitive parts are sensitive data

401
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:37,990
so Thank You Caitlin so much do you have
