1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,990
all right well it falls to me to welcome

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,350
our last guest a Canadian an outspoken

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,300
member of the information security

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,940
community I would say with a brand that

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,730
has global recognition like to welcome

6
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:15,780
Dave Louis

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,810
Gattaca thank you so much for making

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,369
this Dave I understand that you are

9
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:23,100
suffering from both jet lag and flight

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,970
delays today so they could grab me uh

11
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,640
tell us a little bit about what people

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,800
need to know about and Gattaca the brand

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,230
and Dave Lewis the person well see I

14
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,290
never really subscribed to the brand I

15
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,719
just a guy hasn't been doing this for

16
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:41,850
far too long and I made a lot of

17
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,200
mistakes along the way so I get to share

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,820
my stories and hopefully people can

19
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,079
learn from it and that's the way I like

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,579
to you know that's a great thing because

21
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,860
you know obviously we've got some great

22
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,039
Canadian people working in Canada but

23
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,629
you do it a fair amount of work

24
00:00:57,629 --> 00:00:59,820
internationally I do want to talk a

25
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,800
little bit about what we're at what

26
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,180
countries 20:19 brought me to spin the

27
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,740
wheel this year I did about 360,000

28
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,080
kilometers worth of travel and that took

29
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,310
me to Hongkong Singapore Thailand Greece

30
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:23,250
UK US Canada Italy Germany I mean it

31
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,090
just keeps going and going yeah so so

32
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,090
basically what was on your mind in 2019

33
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,369
what were your sort of keynotes and sort

34
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:35,250
of the key synopsis if you will of what

35
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,799
you're thinking well the vast majority

36
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,320
what I've been tackling is sort of

37
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,180
rooted in my first talk that I gave back

38
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,520
in 2013 where I talked about supply

39
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,490
chain security and everybody sort of

40
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,840
looked at me like I had three heads back

41
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,159
then and suddenly in these days

42
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,420
everybody's talking about it which is

43
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,090
kind of cool and it's just looking at

44
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,649
security in a much different way because

45
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,869
I remember years ago after having an

46
00:01:57,869 --> 00:01:59,820
external pen test done trying to explain

47
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,560
the results to the CIO at this

48
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,149
particular company and them saying oh

49
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:04,380
it's okay we have a firewall

50
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,899
everything's fine and that sort of

51
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:08,489
really made me realize that we have to

52
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:10,199
get back to tackling fundamental

53
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,260
security you know the tenants that

54
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,519
we have seemed to have drifted away from

55
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:17,069
chasing the who shinier the zero day of

56
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:20,549
the day and I think that that focus that

57
00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:22,530
we have lost collectively is something

58
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,760
that we really need to pay attention to

59
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,260
you know it's doing things like

60
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,750
vilifying benders and looking at oh look

61
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,060
at that zero day we sort of lose focus

62
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,519
because you know one it's not always

63
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,739
correct and two it's a wasted effort

64
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:36,989
when we should really be looking at core

65
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:39,269
things like network zone segmentation

66
00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:41,970
logging patching I mean I know nobody

67
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,510
finds any of that sexy per se it's far

68
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,150
from sexy be exactly but you know what

69
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:52,349
this is how the business yeah so you

70
00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:54,299
said you've been doing this for a real

71
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,790
long time so how did you get started and

72
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,849
and how did you sort of come up you know

73
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:04,549
to be a very in demand kind of speaker

74
00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:06,870
that part I still wrap my head around

75
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:11,010
because reasons but it actually all

76
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,209
started when I used to work for a record

77
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:14,370
company back and they called MCA records

78
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,959
and then ultimately changed to Universal

79
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:18,449
Music and we had a computer system

80
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:21,900
installed at the office and I rapidly

81
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,349
found that I enjoyed that I had started

82
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:27,959
out with computers back in 1983 so I did

83
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:29,459
have some sort of understanding of it

84
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,370
and I also realized that nobody in the

85
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,549
music industry grows old per se okay

86
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,579
it's not an industry that is kind to

87
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:41,010
older folks and I got your eyes that

88
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,459
early on I was at a conference and

89
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:47,310
rather an award ceremony and the emcee

90
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,780
said look around the room is it the only

91
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,220
people with gray hair and here I'll be

92
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,370
in a ponytail and there'll be the CEO of

93
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,230
the thigh CEOs in the room for had gray

94
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,480
hair in ponytails and I went okay time

95
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,639
to change and that's when I made the

96
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:03,150
jump into information technology at

97
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,949
first started out as a rapid application

98
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:09,030
developer and then my I think ten days

99
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,799
into my first job as a developer I

100
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,389
realized that the security team for this

101
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:13,440
bank and fifty five thousand employees

102
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,949
had one security person Wow yeah and I

103
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:18,959
went okay put up my hand because at that

104
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,310
time at that point in time I was running

105
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,870
my own botnet

106
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,400
this is something it definitely

107
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,160
interests me very very cool and I guess

108
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,370
you know that goes to the point where

109
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:31,770
what we've done in the past may may come

110
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:34,770
back to haunt us in the future but I

111
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,500
want to go back to the music career so

112
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,690
what did you think when you know

113
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,270
file-sharing started happening in the

114
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,550
music industry you know Alan Astor

115
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,860
because you were around during that time

116
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,450
right oh absolutely

117
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,370
um it wasn't that actually came after I

118
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,950
left the record company the really funny

119
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:56,220
thing about it was that when I had my

120
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,940
original interview at MCA they asked me

121
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,860
where I saw the music industry going and

122
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,380
I said in the next five years I imagined

123
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,720
we would be buying music online and they

124
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,880
hated that

125
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,830
I was actually laughed at they said oh

126
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,910
that would just mean everybody would

127
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,350
have the special device they could

128
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,960
download music onto I said yeah if I had

129
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,410
any idea how it's gonna be my goodness

130
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:24,570
yeah yeah there yeah so you know we've

131
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:27,480
we're you we're at the tail end of a +

132
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,170
24 hour 40-plus speaker or even more

133
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:35,010
speakers you know it's great to have you

134
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,750
here because you've got that sort of raw

135
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,870
long arc of information security from

136
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,750
from a country not known for incredibly

137
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,550
aggressive foreign policy and I think

138
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:48,150
that's fair to say how do we see they

139
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:51,000
did you see you know if you see the

140
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,600
internet fragmenting along geopolitical

141
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,030
lines or do you feel it it still has

142
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:00,240
that open kind of all information should

143
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,960
be free type of character unfortunately

144
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,420
I see things leaning more to a draconian

145
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,630
side than I want them to be when I go

146
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,310
back to the early days in the 90s there

147
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,230
were like we were freely sharing

148
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,030
everything I mean I had my own file

149
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:16,950
sharers going sharing we're small the

150
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,050
rest of it and it was very common to

151
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,940
share books and thinks that effect but

152
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,210
nowadays I see it very much tilting in a

153
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,400
way that I'm not overly enthusiastic

154
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,640
I'll be honest I do see it fracturing

155
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,290
along geopolitical lines I know at least

156
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,610
two countries that have set up

157
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:36,819
um contingency so that if they had to

158
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:37,960
they could shut off the rest of the

159
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,550
world and operate their own internal

160
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:43,389
internet interesting yeah so a the

161
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:45,699
pieces of the puzzle are there it just

162
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:47,409
they haven't been all put together and I

163
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:48,909
really don't like the picture that's

164
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,189
going to develop as a result I need a

165
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:57,310
DHCP server for 1.8 million devices all

166
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:00,879
wrote it on a 10 dot X network we laugh

167
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,889
but I know that exists right now yeah

168
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:05,740
and how do you think that plays into

169
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,990
things like nation states and States

170
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:11,500
attacking each other well the funny

171
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,389
thing is you know there's typically you

172
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:14,919
know three or four countries that are

173
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:17,139
you know routinely vilified by the media

174
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:20,409
as being you know the evils types on the

175
00:07:20,409 --> 00:07:22,029
internet but the reality is is any

176
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:23,319
country that has an internet connection

177
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:26,439
has some sort of program in place well

178
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:29,199
yes they attack each other but more to

179
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,360
the effect of you know mining for

180
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,240
information and gathering information in

181
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,620
some cases you have countries that are

182
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,120
going out there trying to steal currency

183
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,099
because you know tariffs and all the

184
00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:40,240
rest of it that they have applied to

185
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,849
them but yeah it's really interesting to

186
00:07:45,849 --> 00:07:47,830
watch it fracturing along geopolitical

187
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:51,789
lines I think we are at the second world

188
00:07:51,789 --> 00:07:54,879
crypto Wars at this point okay so the

189
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,259
earlier version of that but I honestly

190
00:07:56,259 --> 00:07:58,539
see us stumbling into that you're

191
00:07:58,539 --> 00:08:00,879
referring to crypto backdoors being

192
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,279
mandated by countries that's another

193
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:05,229
example of it that's another front as I

194
00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:07,870
see developing which I do have a very

195
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,120
distinct problem with yeah while I

196
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,490
understand their point of view I do not

197
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:16,719
necessarily agree with it yeah so you go

198
00:08:16,719 --> 00:08:19,110
to a bunch of different international

199
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,689
conferences is there any sort of

200
00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:23,889
characteristics that are sort of unique

201
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:27,550
to those kind of conferences so ie you

202
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,050
mentioned that you'd spent a lot of time

203
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,300
in Asia what what is the information

204
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:35,429
security seem like in Asia these days

205
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:38,409
there is actually a pretty strong group

206
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:41,589
there for sure from one country to the

207
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:44,589
next but you have the cultural nuances

208
00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:47,450
that play into the information secure

209
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:49,250
teams or groups rather in those

210
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,080
countries so you will see things like if

211
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,390
I give a presentation in Japan if I

212
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,280
crack a joke it'll probably fall flat

213
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,020
because culturally they it's not

214
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,170
acceptable to laugh at the speaker

215
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,970
whereas in the Philippines you know God

216
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:02,900
love them they'll be rolling in the

217
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,090
aisles if I you know happened to land a

218
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:07,370
good joke all right good note for the

219
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,470
bear farmers future tour yeah there you

220
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:09,650
go

221
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,440
yeah but yeah no I mean I I do see a

222
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,360
very very strong especially in Singapore

223
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,800
there is a very strong security

224
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,250
community there and it's just growing

225
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:22,730
it's rated as the number one security a

226
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,710
country in the world according to the

227
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:30,260
ITU yeah um and on that note do you feel

228
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:33,530
that you know Canadian law Canadian law

229
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:38,510
enforcement is is not up to spec on this

230
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,310
or do you feel like we're doing the best

231
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:43,250
we can in a very Canadian sense or well

232
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,170
being Canadian we tend to do things

233
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,990
quietly we have like if if discussion

234
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,370
was a currency we'd be the richest

235
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:54,320
country in the world oh yeah sorry

236
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,090
yeah but the reality of it is is there

237
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:01,760
is a very strong security underlay here

238
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,070
as well like we look at CSE which is our

239
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,930
game version of the NSA for one a better

240
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:06,320
term

241
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,930
they do very excellent work in their own

242
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:11,780
right as well I mean I'm familiar with

243
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,610
folks from the RCMP and the work they've

244
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:17,690
done one of their now retired members

245
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:21,110
was a long long time contributor to the

246
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,840
end case software yeah he provided all

247
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,060
sorts of software for that that he wrote

248
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,720
of his own volition and provided it just

249
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,700
some of the examples and we also have

250
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,910
things like citizen lab in Toronto so

251
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,680
there's a lot of it we just tend to be

252
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,370
not as vocal as other countries may be

253
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:43,160
ya know but it can't be better than

254
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,260
always I'm gonna transition a little bit

255
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,790
because we're gonna work we're taking

256
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,400
down the final kind of minutes here you

257
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,500
know if there was somebody out there

258
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,990
that was really like interested and has

259
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,030
the passion all right for information

260
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,100
security what would be sort of your

261
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,010
advice on on getting their career kick

262
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:03,140
started what do you see as being sort of

263
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,660
like the most effective you know biggest

264
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,120
bang for the buck well see this is the

265
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,880
crazy thing of it is these days you can

266
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,830
use there's all sorts of online courses

267
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,690
there's all sorts of communities that

268
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:17,330
you can get involved with you know

269
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,160
despite the fact that Twitter can be a

270
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,470
toxic stew it's a great way in all sorts

271
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:24,950
of people fair so their networking is

272
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,630
key you know reaching out introducing

273
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:29,360
yourself and you know being civil about

274
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,970
it too yeah don't go away

275
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:35,180
look at me I'm me oh no you're not no no

276
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:38,180
let's get over ourselves being willing

277
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:41,030
you know to ask questions and not being

278
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,820
afraid to hear the answers because you

279
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,170
know we're not always good at listening

280
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:48,200
collectively but when I started back in

281
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,730
the day there was literally you know

282
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,140
three or four people that were talking

283
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:55,250
on IRC and the rest of it and I mean

284
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,720
obviously I'm being facetious at that

285
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,340
point but yeah anything we had to learn

286
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,170
was by ripping apart and figuring it out

287
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,940
because there weren't university courses

288
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,340
in it there weren't anything you know no

289
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,770
videos you can just flash online so the

290
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:09,050
opportunities there are absolutely

291
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,390
plentiful it's just a matter of having

292
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,830
the wherewithal to reach out ask

293
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,510
questions and do the digging and find

294
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,940
the information right right and I guess

295
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,920
you know Canada's tough one because we

296
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,290
have these vast geographic distances and

297
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:23,870
the costs are travel tooted to make it

298
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,270
to the conferences that that's a huge

299
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,220
challenge so I guess you know virtual

300
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:31,760
and YouTube courses is is probably the

301
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,870
more popular and least inexpensive way

302
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,400
today and a lot of the conference's

303
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,220
stream their content is well alive in

304
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,660
addition to that a lot of them actually

305
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,890
provide all this information later on

306
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:45,440
YouTube so those attracts do tend to

307
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,110
show up and are freely available in many

308
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:52,040
cases so well one of the things that you

309
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,530
mentioned in theirs that the travelling

310
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:56,840
than that so Dave do you think things

311
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,130
like what we do around here

312
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:02,240
will be a helpful and be something that

313
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,060
might become more common but when you

314
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,130
say things around here what are you he

315
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,840
started to serve as our vegetable

316
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,970
conference yeah oh absolutely yeah no

317
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,800
absolutely this is the kind of thing

318
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,000
that needs to happen more

319
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,910
often because where is you know where is

320
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,740
I am able to travel the world to meet

321
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,150
all of these you know customers and

322
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,440
people and talk about security issues

323
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,720
that's not something that everybody has

324
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,120
that opportunity to and I'm very aware

325
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,030
of that so something like this is a huge

326
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:31,070
huge benefit to hit the wider audience

327
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,570
because there's a lot of folks coming up

328
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,610
in most of the conference's I speak at

329
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,050
all asked a simple question I'll say how

330
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,490
many people in this room have been here

331
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,380
in this industry for two years then I'll

332
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,000
say five years ten years and just to get

333
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,420
a gauge of the room invariably about 80

334
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,610
75 or 80 percent of the room has only

335
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:49,550
been at this for two years yeah it just

336
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,920
shows that there is a huge appetite for

337
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,970
content is it fair to say that the

338
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:59,750
content challenges you know because I

339
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,430
you know we talked to a few people

340
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:05,000
working in cloud-based platforms and you

341
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,830
know one common Gabe mentioned was cloud

342
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:13,940
is sort of beta still and people are

343
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:17,120
running apps in it and it changes it's a

344
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,220
very dynamic place it's a dynamic place

345
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,750
but I mean I don't see that as a

346
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,030
detractor in any way shape or form okay

347
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,980
the attractor I see is when people go

348
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,960
crashing into it without all the

349
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,820
information they need to do it like s3

350
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,670
buckets on AWS are a great example right

351
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,990
with the credit card in a web browser

352
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,430
you can spend one of these up put any

353
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,560
sort of data in it you want excuse me

354
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,560
and then carry on but the problem is is

355
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,380
the vast majority people is that is up

356
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,880
don't have a security understanding or

357
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,400
background in many cases and we have

358
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,930
security practitioners is incumbent upon

359
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:53,210
us to share that information to teach

360
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:54,830
them so they don't make simple mistakes

361
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:57,920
like making these buckets public yeah by

362
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,980
default these are set to private there's

363
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,540
even a banner across the screen that

364
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,370
says you know for the love of all is

365
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,610
holy please do public right I mean I may

366
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:10,610
be paraphrasing but you've got a you've

367
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:14,060
got to deliberately misconfigure your

368
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:19,610
assets in cloud to be yeah now but you

369
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:22,040
know we hear about in the news even

370
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,449
today leaky s3 booking

371
00:15:25,449 --> 00:15:28,209
the other data breach blah blah blah but

372
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:30,220
actually and the technology gets blamed

373
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,220
often yes for the problem what actually

374
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,989
it's miss configuration that's not the

375
00:15:34,989 --> 00:15:37,720
technology right and this is where I

376
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,549
have a problem because that tends to be

377
00:15:39,549 --> 00:15:41,290
vilifying the end user which I have a

378
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:43,839
serious problem with because nine times

379
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,279
out of 10 these are folks that actually

380
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,019
have never been taught or do not

381
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:49,779
understand so I take that as a personal

382
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:51,279
failure on our side as security

383
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,439
practitioners I'm not communicating that

384
00:15:53,439 --> 00:15:54,519
out I agree

385
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:58,299
but just to turn I agree now is not the

386
00:15:58,299 --> 00:16:00,339
technology but there was a point in time

387
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:02,579
where the technology was a problem and

388
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:05,829
my perception is the security folk were

389
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:09,220
not brought in to kind of say hey what

390
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,929
about this and those what are your

391
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:13,329
thoughts on that oh absolutely I mean I

392
00:16:13,329 --> 00:16:14,859
work back in the days where we had cave

393
00:16:14,859 --> 00:16:19,329
paintings so I mean I'm very familiar

394
00:16:19,329 --> 00:16:21,009
coming along to how things have

395
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:23,470
transitioned because security was seen

396
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,809
as in some cases not even an

397
00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:27,369
afterthought but something to be routed

398
00:16:27,369 --> 00:16:30,279
around and these days it's well

399
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:31,989
understood that this is a conversation

400
00:16:31,989 --> 00:16:34,029
to have up front so you have one pound

401
00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:36,129
up front you can pay or 10,000 pounds on

402
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:38,019
the back end to fix the problem yeah so

403
00:16:38,019 --> 00:16:40,389
it is in a risk discussion that's a

404
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:41,919
whole lot more sense to have that

405
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:44,109
conversation before the bad things

406
00:16:44,109 --> 00:16:46,389
happen great and ultimately whether

407
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:48,369
we're building a server on pram or in

408
00:16:48,369 --> 00:16:50,889
the cloud the problems have been there

409
00:16:50,889 --> 00:16:54,549
forever and what drives infrastructure

410
00:16:54,549 --> 00:16:56,289
and software and systems to be built is

411
00:16:56,289 --> 00:16:59,169
get them working right you're working

412
00:16:59,169 --> 00:17:00,850
are they operational yes I mean we

413
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:03,009
talked about this in previous talk does

414
00:17:03,009 --> 00:17:05,349
it work yeah fine great great move on

415
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:07,959
next project and that's that

416
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:09,669
historically has been the problem in

417
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:12,699
cloud similar problem and you've spoken

418
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:15,699
about this before yeah get everything

419
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:18,159
working and if that means getting a

420
00:17:18,159 --> 00:17:21,250
security group in AWS [ __ ] around with

421
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,138
so that you've got very different and

422
00:17:23,138 --> 00:17:26,349
access control list and encryption after

423
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:28,779
the f5 load balancer and encrypted

424
00:17:28,779 --> 00:17:31,330
databases like all of the everybody

425
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,789
knows how to do this stuff like our nose

426
00:17:33,789 --> 00:17:36,240
I'm gonna say the theory behind

427
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,669
but where it seems to fall apart is like

428
00:17:38,669 --> 00:17:40,830
when you're dealing with the tech stack

429
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,260
and there's minor incompatibilities or

430
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,929
stuffer at different you know release

431
00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:49,020
levels and then just to meet that

432
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:52,860
production deadline you know things are

433
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:56,580
cut right just make it work yes just

434
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,649
make it work and I know you know when

435
00:17:58,649 --> 00:18:00,990
you go in post on it and you look at

436
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:03,179
these things yes sometimes you can get

437
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:04,799
away with putting the database

438
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,750
connections inside few SEC panels for

439
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,390
instance as a as a workaround solution

440
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:11,429
right but not if it's a high latency

441
00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:13,770
thing so you know we're always battling

442
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:17,309
and you know trying to retro actively

443
00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:20,460
apply you know security and this was

444
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,740
also because it's shifting sands from

445
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,230
audit and compliance perspective right

446
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:28,440
you know as a great example I know of an

447
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,470
audit finding that one in 16 character

448
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:35,520
service passwords now you know well well

449
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,580
you know there are systems perhaps even

450
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,490
Dave Louis has worked on them that don't

451
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:44,880
physically have the capability of a 16

452
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,799
character password in fact the operating

453
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,730
system is locked at 800 I can confirm

454
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:54,240
yeah so swing in your spark platform for

455
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,700
instance it's a great example I'm not

456
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,799
gonna be compliant with that audit

457
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,429
finding right so Dave we're wrapping it

458
00:19:02,429 --> 00:19:05,130
up here because um you know we've we've

459
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:07,440
had a long haul if you could impart some

460
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,710
of your wisdom to the next generation

461
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:13,529
coming up you talked about getting

462
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:16,980
involved what do they what technologies

463
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,070
do you think that they need to know

464
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,809
moving forward

465
00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:23,460
well the technologies I would put to one

466
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,380
side I would say learn how to

467
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,200
communicate and learn how to write yeah

468
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,880
those are key fundaments cuz if you

469
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,799
cannot communicate what it is that

470
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:33,630
you're trying to address in a salient

471
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,720
fashion it's never going to get done and

472
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,970
then Twitter gives you a go standstill

473
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,730
sorry Visio diagram is like a very

474
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:44,490
powerful tool and unfortunately I don't

475
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:47,130
see enough of them well even now you now

476
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:49,110
we look at stuff like AWS and

477
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,550
and Google cloud and all the rest of it

478
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:53,280
the issue I have there is this you

479
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,080
doesn't even work anymore because of the

480
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,700
scale that you can spin up in a matter

481
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,070
of hours so where I could build out an

482
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,780
infrastructure for a data center which

483
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,610
literally took me about a year and a

484
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,860
half to do I can now do that in the

485
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,640
space of the two days yeah so it just

486
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:15,210
yeah but also I guess it's not about the

487
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:16,980
tech is it you're right Dave it's about

488
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,460
the approach and the the method by which

489
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:23,640
you develop technology yeah if you look

490
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:28,770
at AWS then you I guess you code as much

491
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:32,430
as you possibly can so that means in AWS

492
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,110
terms you're talking about cloud

493
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:36,960
formation right so you've got something

494
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,790
you can review you've not somebody

495
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:41,310
spending up on ec2 instance manually and

496
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,080
doing all that configuration around it

497
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,030
it's all done in a format ID and

498
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:47,640
well-understood configuration file or

499
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,970
files and then there's also your

500
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:53,610
documentation so if you've got properly

501
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:56,400
built infrastructure using code then you

502
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,570
can read that code and you can

503
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:58,860
understand how they just which is being

504
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,230
built that's why it's assuming the code

505
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,940
is documented properly and I've yet to

506
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,380
find any that I've ever called

507
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,690
documented properly you will one day you

508
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:20,850
one day yes document this word really

509
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:23,040
quick question Dave yeah what is an

510
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,410
advisory see so I've been intrigued by

511
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:29,550
that's Hospice I'm very curious well

512
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,410
this is a role that I started at Akamai

513
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:33,120
when I was there for five years and then

514
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,040
when I transitioned over to duo and now

515
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,800
Cisco it came with me so it basically is

516
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:42,260
a conversation how do I put it

517
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,550
glorify talking head is the easiest way

518
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,770
to put it yeah somebody that goes around

519
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:49,200
I speak at about 40 or 45 conferences a

520
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,140
year trying to impart ideas of you know

521
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,890
supply chain security or zero trust or

522
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:57,660
getting back to core fundamentals so

523
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,490
having the conversations and trying to

524
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:01,260
share lessons learn from you know I

525
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,640
spent 20 years as a defender

526
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,080
before I crossed into the vendor space

527
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,270
and you know being able to have these

528
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:09,480
conversations in a non funny way and not

529
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,160
going hey look at that vendor over there

530
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,050
they're terrible that doesn't further

531
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:14,940
the conversation any way shape or form

532
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:18,110
and it's not Canadian

533
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,360
but ya know it's literally it's about

534
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,860
you know having those conversations so I

535
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,360
get the you know meet at conferences

536
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,280
meet with customers and I do a lot of

537
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,320
security research as well and I haven't

538
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,450
done any vulnerability disclosure since

539
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,640
2008 I think was my last one

540
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,410
oddly enough the same year my daughter

541
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:36,030
was born so I was pretty much the end of

542
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:40,080
that but ya know so that's the role is

543
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,850
very much about infecting the

544
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,680
bloodstream and trying to get the point

545
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,410
across that we can and we do have the

546
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:48,600
ability to do a better job oh that's

547
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,410
awesome that's cool yeah and I get to

548
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,520
