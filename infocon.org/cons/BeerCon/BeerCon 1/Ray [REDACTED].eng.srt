afternoon everyone

10
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,590
Asia we have just crossed the halfway

11
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,189
point our summer cast

12
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:28,980
our past fundraisers and we are

13
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,390
certainly hoping to reach the halfway

14
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,668
point on our goals as well very very

15
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:35,100
shortly that we are that we are so

16
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,530
you've told us that you've got quiet I

17
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,110
don't know an action-packed agender of

18
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:47,340
things you want to talk about we match

19
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,239
any donations of 133 thousand seventy

20
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,510
pence made that offer without realizing

21
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,370
that GoFundMe doesn't allow people to

22
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:05,489
donate seventy pence I will be in the

23
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:07,799
next hour I'll be matching any donations

24
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:10,740
whatsoever the Exide so if you are a

25
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,680
half asleep one twitch right now and you

26
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,060
want to just make a donation for two or

27
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,000
three pounds during this talk please do

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,430
so because we want to keep this momentum

29
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,380
up you could go into the second half so

30
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,659
but Mike gift you're right I did have a

31
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:25,740
few things I wanted to talk about

32
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,759
because I am very old I'm the old school

33
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,360
hacker and I call us the wargames

34
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,000
generation meaning that we were preteens

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,829
but we're the movie wargames came out in

36
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:40,320
1984 sure I was gonna give up a nice

37
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,030
little history of the history of freakin

38
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,350
and a lot of the people that were there

39
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,170
but I've been listening to the beer pong

40
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,890
podcast for about ten hours now and I've

41
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,270
heard a lot of things that kind of

42
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,770
trying to decided that I want to talk

43
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,079
about something else which I haven't

44
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:57,840
really heard that much about and that is

45
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,719
this you know we as a community as an

46
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,600
infoset community there are about three

47
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,399
million of us there's 2.8 million

48
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:08,429
workers in the cyber security field ok

49
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:11,270
and if we think in terms of how big

50
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,520
Twitter

51
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,700
those seconds even if it will be

52
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,050
extremely generous okay we're talking

53
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,670
about under three hundred thousand

54
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,650
people and then of those three hundred

55
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,980
thousand people there's probably maybe

56
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,110
five hundred that are particularly vocal

57
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,780
or particularly well-known and so when

58
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,150
we talk about community issues community

59
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,220
building and a lot of these things it's

60
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,040
really important to understand that what

61
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,230
we see on the surface even in the mini

62
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,710
heights of discord is the absolute small

63
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,180
percentage of the very very small

64
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,680
percentage of the entire community

65
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,080
period right so we're talking about you

66
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,050
know significantly less than 10 percent

67
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,720
of everyone who works in InfoSec will

68
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,780
ever attend a con at all okay

69
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,550
hopefully this this counts as the cons

70
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,720
that may be really be getting that

71
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,640
number up yeah and Twitter is not a

72
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,160
statistically significant reflection of

73
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,660
the community its what Twitter is a

74
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,900
representation of a very specific type

75
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,660
of member of the community right and I

76
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,610
think that that is I've heard several

77
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,709
folks talk about cybersecurity shortage

78
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:20,910
this how shortage certainly the need for

79
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,900
diverse viewpoints and things like that

80
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,990
that is the one of the biggest drivers

81
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,510
that I think is extremely important when

82
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,790
we talk about growing this industry from

83
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,560
3 million to 7 million people in the

84
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,290
next few years is we have to open it up

85
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,780
we have to get people with different

86
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,850
ability levels different different

87
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,190
different underrepresented communities

88
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,240
you know certainly increase the

89
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,570
diversity for people of color and LGBTQI

90
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,040
all of those types of things because

91
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,630
it's simply a matter of survival we

92
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:53,260
absolutely are better the more diverse

93
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,030
we are nice but I'm going to play that

94
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,170
in there any thoughts on that

95
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:59,140
I completely agree completely agree and

96
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,330
it's interesting isn't it Jenny thoughts

97
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:04,270
about the the UK community circuit being

98
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,220
pretty much the same people and it's

99
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,070
true you know what I've been practically

100
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,050
all these science conferences in the UK

101
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,780
this year and you do see the same people

102
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,489
every time okay

103
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:17,529
and I guess socials it speaks to your

104
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:20,200
point ray about it about the the actual

105
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,940
active community in four seconds a real

106
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,790
microcosm of the wider industry it's

107
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,570
just the same

108
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,280
people all the time that's not a bad

109
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,010
thing but I think again to your point is

110
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,110
it's high time we started seeing fresh

111
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,150
faces and getting new ideas and new

112
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,940
experiences involved yeah no just keep

113
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,190
in mind that the vast majority of people

114
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:42,940
will never actually necessarily tweet or

115
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,400
give a con talk or even be on a panel

116
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,350
right but they are reading some of those

117
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:52,450
things right you know when we get into

118
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,940
some of our our echo chamber type

119
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,850
discussions or our you know micro disk

120
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:00,010
arguments or whatever about password

121
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,510
policies etc I think we just need to be

122
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,260
very kind so the fact that there is a

123
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,400
entire community of probes out there

124
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,680
that are not necessarily speaking but

125
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,990
are definitely listening to us so that

126
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,670
was that was the kind of the that was

127
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,260
kind of my big my big plug based on that

128
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,850
and I have enjoyed a lot of the other

129
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,860
podcast we've got all I'm here today but

130
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,420
I actually really want to build that out

131
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,670
towards kind of something that I'm

132
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:24,190
extremely passionate about and what I'm

133
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,900
actually kind of involved in this

134
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,660
podcast for and that is you know when we

135
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,030
look at statistics I'm an American so

136
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,920
pardon me for using an American

137
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,350
statistics here but really would be more

138
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,480
applicable to use global ones but about

139
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,370
one in five people prettier than the

140
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,350
flip okay so one one about twenty

141
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,210
percent of the people in the world

142
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:46,510
suffer at some point from the flu and

143
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:49,390
because of that we have vaccines we have

144
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,370
hand-washing campaigns we have

145
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,830
sanitizers we have things on the tube

146
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,810
that advertise you know behaviors and

147
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,360
things like that but twenty eight

148
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,880
percent of the world population has

149
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,860
suffered a mental health issue in the

150
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,810
last twelve months so think about that

151
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:07,960
statistic okay and the vast majority of

152
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,870
those twenty eight percent of people did

153
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,370
not get any treatment at all they did

154
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:13,900
not go to a doctor they did not get a

155
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,270
medicine they did not even necessarily

156
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,850
talk to a priest or counselor at all

157
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,220
though that is and ultimately that

158
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,110
really kind of was what brought me to

159
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:26,800
this podcast was one of our two

160
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,220
charities that were fundraising for is

161
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:33,010
mental health hackers just an initiative

162
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,419
the demand of Berlin and some other

163
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:36,460
folks started in order to address this

164
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,860
and by the way I know

165
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,080
talk a lot about Amanda Berlin but we

166
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,490
can't talk about this without also

167
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:43,099
mentioning people like Jason Street

168
00:06:43,099 --> 00:06:45,210
hockey and a lot of other folks that are

169
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:47,120
very very much at the forefront of

170
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,520
addressing mental issues in our industry

171
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:55,020
because our industry has a lot of

172
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,870
behaviors that are identified to self

173
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,689
harm something medication gas lighting

174
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:03,300
and posture snare drum toxicity all of

175
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,439
those things with a lot of the other

176
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:06,719
pipe coasters I've been talking about

177
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:09,569
but the one that really really really

178
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:12,360
kind of stings and I think it's the

179
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,189
elephant in the room if I can use an

180
00:07:14,189 --> 00:07:17,669
American expression took off we've got

181
00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:22,289
wedding yet again and that is that a lot

182
00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:25,919
of the folks in our industry and the

183
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,870
shocking number of folks both publicly

184
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:30,330
and Muslim finally had been affected by

185
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,939
childhood sexual trauma so just to give

186
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:36,000
you kind of overall statistics we're

187
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,439
typically talking about one in five

188
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:39,629
males and one in three females have had

189
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:41,699
some type of sad childhood sexual trauma

190
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:44,550
in their lifetime at about ninety

191
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,800
percent of people that have a

192
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,569
developmental delay or disability

193
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:51,500
compensation assaulted so you can see

194
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,210
that those statistics first of all are

195
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,740
just absolutely shocking we're talking

196
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,330
about four million in the United Kingdom

197
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:01,020
about 50 million in the USA but when I

198
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,060
was getting ready to talk at the

199
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,330
first-ever mental health village it was

200
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:10,589
actually Derby time in 2018 I decided to

201
00:08:10,589 --> 00:08:11,909
see what those statistics would look

202
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:14,129
like inside our community so I went out

203
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:15,719
and hired to research crimes and

204
00:08:15,719 --> 00:08:18,210
interest of getting a little bit of a

205
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,370
scientific way of looking at the same

206
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:22,949
statistics and I asked him you know tell

207
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:25,680
me how many people in the hacker

208
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,319
community and the InfoSec community have

209
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,879
been affected by childhood sexual trauma

210
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,578
and the results were extremely

211
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:34,500
surprising because neither company was

212
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,260
able to give me those statistics neither

213
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,779
company was actually able to come up

214
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:40,979
with something that they considered to

215
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,559
be reliable metrics for that I marilee

216
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,970
because people don't necessarily answer

217
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,949
the survey it's you know artifis later

218
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:49,230
truthfully or whatever but what they did

219
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,000
tell me just

220
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,140
is that if we look at a career matrix

221
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,100
where you would put in prosthetic

222
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,770
professionals and hackers etc is

223
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:02,540
probably closest to police officers

224
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,140
psychiatrists and priests

225
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,200
right all of which have overwhelmingly

226
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,020
disproportionate representation of folks

227
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,190
that have been affected by childhood

228
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,510
sexual trauma at some point of their

229
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,270
life and so I think that it's safe to

230
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,130
say like that statistic about one in

231
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:20,220
five males at one of three females is

232
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,529
probably way way way low for our

233
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:24,690
industry and it is something that you

234
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:25,860
know folks like Dennis applies

235
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,040
foundation and mental health hackers etc

236
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,540
I'm really really been talking a lot

237
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,100
about and the reason I'm bringing that

238
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,410
up by the way is because I know that on

239
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,990
the the microcosm echo chamber Twitter

240
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,820
there are still some folks out there

241
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:43,950
that are anti COCs right codependents

242
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,720
like they're still opposed to that and I

243
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,610
think if you look at that in terms of

244
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,529
the statistics that escape you might

245
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:51,120
have a little bit of a different opinion

246
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,640
about that because the vast you think

247
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,500
about what's going on at a conference if

248
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,210
you realize that up to meme you know up

249
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,980
to half the folks there and affected by

250
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,350
assault or trauma in their life it kind

251
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,470
of changes the aura surrounds around

252
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:06,780
behaviors what do you do I think that's

253
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,550
fascinating I think it puts a hell of a

254
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:12,360
lot into perspective I also think you

255
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,890
should probably color the way people

256
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:14,970
think when they're dealing with other

257
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,920
people and I often think about this

258
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,200
generally in life that this is saying

259
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,480
that you know don't don't ever judge

260
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,890
people because you don't know what kind

261
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:26,010
of bad day they're having so when you

262
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:29,370
trolling people on the web Switzer or

263
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:32,670
whatever or being a dick generally and

264
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,860
you know you really could be the the

265
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:39,660
switch that finishes somebody off so I

266
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,339
think I think we all can learn from that

267
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:43,950
and even if we can't get inside the

268
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:46,950
understanding of how people feel we

269
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,180
should be sensitive to the fact that

270
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,100
they are necessarily they aren't

271
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,470
necessarily full of beans and everything

272
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,089
isn't necessarily going great for an

273
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:56,640
individual in their life and we

274
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,350
shouldn't compare that problem but I

275
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,580
think we should do everything within our

276
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,470
power to to try and sensitive to other

277
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,340
people's situations

278
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:06,250
yeah absolutely I mean I do see progress

279
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,170
being made and I would tell you again

280
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:11,800
I'm on fire so it's a long time I would

281
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,840
tell you I've seen eating in the last 24

282
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,270
months a lot of the efforts including

283
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,620
this podcast itself which they're

284
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:21,550
raising money for about a civil rights

285
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,080
organization as well as the mental

286
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,330
health trackers sitting there oh by the

287
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:27,250
way if you're listening to this you can

288
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,360
donate right now the link is right

289
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,430
directly in the Twitter meeting still

290
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:35,320
right now you see did you see yeah I do

291
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,690
see progress being made there and I

292
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,670
definitely see I know dear farmers does

293
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,380
a lot of stuff and he has to collect

294
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,810
ours as well I mean if you go to youtube

295
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:46,990
and you take them in fact that will help

296
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,970
they'll see tons of videos for people

297
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:51,370
talking about impostor syndrome and and

298
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:54,250
gaslighting and self-harm and very very

299
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,740
famous talk that everyone should watch

300
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:01,120
was Jason streets talk at sky dog sky

301
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,670
and sky khon sky don't come I don't know

302
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,320
the only thing that's gonna scare

303
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,110
against his rant about a lot of issues

304
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:10,120
of any quality than assault deception so

305
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,770
I don't mean to be necessarily a total

306
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,720
downer about these types of things but I

307
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,730
do think they need is something that we

308
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,980
don't discuss enough and I will tell you

309
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:21,310
that I think that it probably would

310
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:23,170
behoove us to be a little bit more aware

311
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:24,370
of that especially when we're talking

312
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,860
about using language that might trigger

313
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,660
people I know that there's a big joke to

314
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,250
say to a your warning this before you're

315
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,350
wanting that but certain words can

316
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,910
actually bring back memories and in a

317
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,830
way but you know you may actually intend

318
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:36,400
itself

319
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,200
ya know that's it that's that's sort of

320
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,790
my soapbox that's my soapbox are we

321
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,950
getting donations up so much that would

322
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,650
be

323
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,940
I'm sure think we're reaching for that

324
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:49,690
credit cards right now and if not we'll

325
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:52,060
come find them will tear their money one

326
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,130
way or another can I ask you a question

327
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:55,839
right sure

328
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,050
do you find that the information that

329
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,000
you provided arias is really really

330
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,839
interesting and quite scary actually

331
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,610
would you say that that is

332
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:09,670
representative of InfoSec as a thing or

333
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,110
would you say it's representative of

334
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,750
wider technology as an industry or would

335
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,089
you say that it's it's representative of

336
00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:16,810
human life

337
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,730
is it something that work was seeing as

338
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,650
a problem in information security per se

339
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:23,680
or is it is it a general problem well I

340
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,090
mean and I'm not gonna necessarily

341
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,670
mention any of the previous podcasters

342
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,110
that have been on this podcast but I'll

343
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,640
just speak from my own experience sure

344
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,590
there's a certain generation of us in

345
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,420
InfoSec that started out black hats

346
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,460
right and when I say black hats I don't

347
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,980
mean working through the NSA on CNA and

348
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,560
then traveling the nation states I'm

349
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,750
talking about cracking Commodore 64

350
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,790
games and dialing BBS is that were in

351
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:52,840
Canada just by defeating copy protection

352
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,960
or doping gang suits or I guess in the

353
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,610
more current generation it might be

354
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:01,120
mining gold on boards or something like

355
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,190
that yeah so because of the fact that

356
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:06,660
nympho SEC has a gray hat or a black hat

357
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,380
roots that are out there

358
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,660
you're going to necessarily attract

359
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:13,150
certain people that have had criminal

360
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,790
deviances or criminal to the pass or

361
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,530
just this incredible and innate

362
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:20,080
curiosity right and in the last five or

363
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,210
six years we've managed to take that to

364
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,670
take back the term hacker right so that

365
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,380
you can think about books like Marcus

366
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,090
Carey's try the hackers and you think

367
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:29,920
about a lot of the conference's that now

368
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,480
use that in the positive way et cetera

369
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,600
we definitely turn the tide so to speak

370
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,180
at least inside of our history on that

371
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,880
particular term but I do think that it

372
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,850
is indicative of society overall it's

373
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,890
just it's a very narrow use case right

374
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,450
because it takes a special kind of a

375
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,760
person to want to be involved in this

376
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,340
industry it's you know right you have to

377
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,590
have a little bit of a um a little bit

378
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:56,350
of a I don't want to say malfunction but

379
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,820
there's certainly the characteristics

380
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,830
for there that are out there and that's

381
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:02,170
that's one of the reasons why you know

382
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:04,660
when in many many cases people talk

383
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,400
about the family the hyper family

384
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,340
immediately get to be have these

385
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,920
relations well in many cases and again

386
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,300
I'm not going to speak for other people

387
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,070
but in many cases some of our family

388
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,510
lives maybe weren't that great right

389
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:19,600
with a family of origin or a parents or

390
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,490
whatever else that is so there is a need

391
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:23,800
that can be met by this community and

392
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,530
that certainly does have two sides to it

393
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,110
one is the generosity and the

394
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,769
overwhelming support

395
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:31,379
and the other one is sort of the

396
00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:33,759
infighting in the feuding typically does

397
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,480
along with the family yeah yeah sure so

398
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,529
we just want to be more of the first

399
00:15:38,529 --> 00:15:41,350
unless it's a second I guess but you

400
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:44,649
know I will tell you I strive to always

401
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:46,089
try to meet people with completely

402
00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:48,220
different backgrounds and it is amazing

403
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,449
to be you've had two people in the

404
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,879
podcast in the last 10 hours that were a

405
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:54,579
year or under or just around the year

406
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:57,069
and I've already amassed these massive

407
00:15:57,069 --> 00:15:59,170
huge followings and passive networks of

408
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,179
people etc so I don't think it should be

409
00:16:01,179 --> 00:16:03,220
intimidating to people based on your the

410
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,350
experience yeah I don't even think it

411
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,790
should be in two million people very so

412
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,860
whether you can code or whether you can

413
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,660
reverse engineer already good social

414
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,089
engineer all of those insecurities and

415
00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:15,309
concerns I think kind of go to the

416
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:17,230
wayside when you understand you know the

417
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,670
community at whole and how much

418
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:21,009
diversity that's out there yeah

419
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:24,009
completely so really we were going to

420
00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:25,540
talk about predictions no the original

421
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,429
would you guys saw me on this we were

422
00:16:27,429 --> 00:16:30,910
going to talk about 2019 and review of

423
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:33,759
2020 looking forward we have a whole lot

424
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,049
of that to me other folks happily we

425
00:16:35,049 --> 00:16:37,329
haven't really gotten any any really big

426
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:51,249
ones goals see somebody really truly put

427
00:16:51,249 --> 00:16:54,069
a stake in that one because even just

428
00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:56,199
today we were seeing you know Microsoft

429
00:16:56,199 --> 00:16:58,389
announced 44 million passwords that were

430
00:16:58,389 --> 00:17:01,179
being reused across data breach sites

431
00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:03,579
etc so the credential stuffing is

432
00:17:03,579 --> 00:17:06,549
absolutely positively going to work I

433
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:10,148
think that we will continuously see

434
00:17:10,148 --> 00:17:12,250
progress made make it maybe a

435
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,230
multi-factor American banks over the

436
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,520
last ones to embrace it

437
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,138
but I think with some regulars and

438
00:17:17,138 --> 00:17:18,730
regulations and some laws changing I

439
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:21,099
think we will probably see a lot more of

440
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:24,010
that I very much think that we will

441
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,109
start to see and I'm hoping that we will

442
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:28,799
start to see a much more diverse

443
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,120
representation than keynotes and I will

444
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,059
call RSA up right now because RSA

445
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:36,549
been criticized very very much for not

446
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:38,950
having women to be notes this year there

447
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,870
this year their keynotes are absolutely

448
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,429
amazing

449
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:44,049
female lineup and they've gone the key

450
00:17:44,049 --> 00:17:45,700
note aside and okay D mysterious is one

451
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,669
of those there's a few others really

452
00:17:48,669 --> 00:17:49,990
good mine up so I think that they have

453
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:52,870
responded to that type of activity in

454
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:55,179
that criticism and I think the mini ads

455
00:17:55,179 --> 00:17:56,890
Club is probably gonna cost ten thousand

456
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:00,360
number just at some point in the year

457
00:18:01,409 --> 00:18:02,980
reasonable to me

458
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:06,340
and I think and there will be more of

459
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,230
the same

460
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,460
yeah I think it'll be there'll be more

461
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,350
breaches that we more nation state

462
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:15,250
badness happening there were more people

463
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,289
falling out and more drama I think

464
00:18:17,289 --> 00:18:18,820
probably on social media I don't think

465
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,780
it's something we're ever going to

466
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:24,309
really get rid of in the world but we're

467
00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:25,840
on the right side of it so I think as

468
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,220
long as we keep doing what we're doing

469
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,169
keep fighting the government will get

470
00:18:29,169 --> 00:18:30,490
that how much do you think elected

471
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:32,080
security is gonna be in the news for the

472
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,360
next year 2020 do you think it'll be a

473
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,980
lot a little probably a lot we haven't

474
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,450
seen a lot of progress being made there

475
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,340
you know I don't know if you follow that

476
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,590
blaze or Rachel toe back on Twitter etc

477
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:48,658
but I've seen a lot of discussions but

478
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:53,440
yeah and obviously you know when we talk

479
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,909
about the influence campaigns and

480
00:18:54,909 --> 00:18:56,500
Facebook and some of those other folks

481
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,500
it's it's it's it's rather dicey whether

482
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,360
anything is really being done to to stop

483
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,340
that aspect of its you yeah no I

484
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,890
completely agree okay well we're we're

485
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:09,250
out of time right really really best

493
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,480
thanks to the entire AV crew that has

494
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,240
been working for 14 hours straight and
