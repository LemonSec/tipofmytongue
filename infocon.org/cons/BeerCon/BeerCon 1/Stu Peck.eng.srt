clean living and the love of the baby

9
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:36,690
Jesus let me tell you so what if you

10
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,360
believe that this is sort of like the

11
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,129
second time that you're opening the show

12
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:46,379
but this is your official talking

13
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:52,559
segment so I guess the question is Stu

14
00:00:52,559 --> 00:01:07,770
what's going on we've we've got like 30

15
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,830
more guests today so are that more that

16
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,240
I think maybe somewhere around 30 so

17
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:28,590
you're 29 brother served the three small

18
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,450
kids so pretty sure it's gonna go

19
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:46,290
downhill quite rapidly before I got some

20
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,619
sleep and it's it's been amazing amazing

21
00:01:49,619 --> 00:02:02,040
on my conference I'm really impressed by

22
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,840
the way the communities come out on that

23
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:10,530
we're at 4225 in donations really really

24
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,849
amazing

25
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:15,459
the many hats clubs though you guys have

26
00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:19,480
been doing online events for how long

27
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,159
now well just under two years the

28
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:28,120
community started in September the 27th

29
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,310
two years ago ever it was right answer

30
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:34,540
to me sympathy yes we've been you know

31
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:39,090
our first guests was Jack I'd actually

32
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,180
and podcaster thing was kind of started

33
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,329
because we wanted we had a community and

34
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:49,269
and it was it was I don't know is it

35
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:52,810
like about 900 just shy of a thousand

36
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,430
people think at the time it's you to

37
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,680
just under just under a thousand I think

38
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,040
and the problem is with communities

39
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,139
without online community is that you've

40
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:03,519
got to give people a reason to be there

41
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,849
yeah it's great talking about InfoSec is

42
00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:11,230
great having conversations but because

43
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,909
we're all kind of busy people were quite

44
00:03:12,909 --> 00:03:16,180
and we can fit with being or quite

45
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,780
quickly an online chat can also quite a

46
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:27,069
lot of times descend into madness so

47
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:28,900
having a reason for people to come back

48
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,799
or to engage or note excited about

49
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,109
something is one of things wants to do

50
00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:38,379
so so the whole idea was to try and get

51
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:40,780
you know people well known people and

52
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,639
less event people as well to talk about

53
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,009
interesting things and that's go away

54
00:03:45,009 --> 00:03:50,709
started because it's mainly because I

55
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:59,739
wanted it was I hey we're just gonna run

56
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,989
a community in yeah what no idea what

57
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:03,790
the hell we were doing I certainly had

58
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,290
no idea what the hell I was doing I mean

59
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:12,250
I've been around in IRC you know I'll

60
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,680
see you know pretty enjoyed that and I

61
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,819
think a lot of people have seen enjoyed

62
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:18,099
that as well and and so when we decide

63
00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:20,199
to start many hats Thomas I wanted

64
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:23,320
something that was quite known I looked

65
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,690
at sort of platforms at the time and

66
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,730
there's discourse of the site I'm not

67
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:30,580
gonna do it not gonna do like a for news

68
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:36,640
Forbes at that so how did it morph into

69
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,730
a physical meetup because it's it's not

70
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:42,550
just an online thing now it's almost a

71
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,770
convention in its own right right like

72
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:57,550
44 Khan you did you did yeah I don't

73
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:22,390
recall that so two passes right so if I

74
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,350
take you the next day

75
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,300
so when you get podcast on then you have

76
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,780
podcasts on discord you guys pretty cool

77
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,490
get some pretty good names at the time

78
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,320
and I'm still surprised about the number

79
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,610
of you know people yeah a lot of your

80
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,010
line of guests here we've had all night

81
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:42,940
Rory Dave Kennedy quite a few of the

82
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,800
people that you spoke to so far I know

83
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,370
about streets we've had on and we got

84
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:52,020
like people like Miko I wishes I

85
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:05,350
archived stuff but yeah go to your

86
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,610
question because I'm obviously quite

87
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:12,910
tired and brambly focusing on the points

88
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,730
right so it's like the next level really

89
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,140
for us to me like we've got you've got a

90
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:20,260
community here and online and the idea

91
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,970
was to kind of go well we'll go to

92
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,550
conferences meetcha there and again I'd

93
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,870
be too crafty meet up soon

94
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,290
for a second time speaking outside I

95
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,240
think I think I should you know get

96
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:47,810
people together no no we can we can do a

97
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,420
physical one so actually Stu her suicide

98
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,690
well uh I can I can host you at photo

99
00:06:53,690 --> 00:07:05,770
box if you want to do he was like hey

100
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:14,270
and it's kind of made it happening just

101
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,860
kind of happen to them I got speakers

102
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,440
themself and see at least you did it

103
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,120
talk as well

104
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,830
there was a Chrissy did the other one

105
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:25,070
yeah cuz she Morgan it's a swordfish and

106
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,750
it just kind of happened

107
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,790
and we had a great turnout like about

108
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:37,460
1840 for cotton to come to our meetup

109
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:40,310
which was I oh that's pretty big I just

110
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,720
II floored actually said we want to host

111
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:49,370
you as I've got kids and going to your

112
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,470
meetup so that's why we did it the

113
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:54,860
following year it was successful I've

114
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,120
learned a lot of lessons from hosting

115
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:12,560
meetups actually having a coat on and

116
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,480
it's a good mix of people so rather than

117
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,510
just being all I see so sore you know

118
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,850
blue team professional InfoSec people we

119
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:22,160
have hackers we have you know CISOs we

120
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,860
have students slice of the life yeah

121
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,930
it's it's a cross-section of the entire

122
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,120
people may be outside you developers

123
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,340
come as well from a wasp and things like

124
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,650
this and you know so it's a really good

125
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,690
cross-section of the community in it it

126
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:40,099
just kind of works alright so yeah we're

127
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:42,169
quite lucky in that sense that we can

128
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:44,510
transcend the online community and do

129
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:48,010
meet that protocol

130
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,320
you know I'm quite proud to say that

131
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,560
failed this cuz the reason I'm quite

132
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,690
proud just because the venue went bust

133
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,970
so we wouldn't lost all the money oh

134
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,730
yeah yeah actually went into

135
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:03,550
administration at like about four weeks

136
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,560
ago

137
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,940
yeah raise the 89 thousand for the place

138
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,910
we had climbed and then like we just

139
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,650
lost the venue cost which is like 40

140
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:20,080
grand wow that's quite well established

141
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:33,450
venue as well it's not like it was yes

142
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:37,480
crazy crazy stuff well I'm so glad with

143
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,870
the success of like the many hats club I

144
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:43,090
mean obviously beer con one when two

145
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,340
happened without you and your crew and

146
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,470
and your support

147
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:50,170
what do you see 20/20 involvement

148
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,060
because you did mention that you're

149
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:55,000
gonna go full-blown nonprofit is is this

150
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,060
gonna be sort of your major effort

151
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,830
because you do have a day job as well

152
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:08,260
right full-time I don't think I can turn

153
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:11,350
into a full-time and I don't foresee

154
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,720
that happening in the short term it is

155
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,490
like a full-time job in some respects

156
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,020
because he any spare time I have I'm

157
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:24,730
doing stuff but it's very much very much

158
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:27,700
for me a big pressure now because you've

159
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:34,090
greatly the monster yeah over 7,000

160
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:36,460
people under bin it's how many those

161
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:40,960
people alive or lurking also he'll

162
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,570
invest their time is a core of people at

163
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:46,210
better time and a lot of people like to

164
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:57,940
lurk because but but nonprofit it for me

165
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:01,120
it's quite important because

166
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,279
we know we can raise money for good

167
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,339
causes so last year we raised I think it

168
00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:08,920
was like just shy of six grand

169
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,579
we raised in selling off auctioning off

170
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:14,920
through rate with reproductive tickets

171
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:21,180
for Derby cough money for die initiative

172
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,009
innocent Orkin and actually healthy

173
00:11:24,009 --> 00:11:25,629
habits as well actually you ready to

174
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:27,699
just have just under like five think

175
00:11:27,699 --> 00:11:30,910
it's like just under six or five but for

176
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,980
a community it's not really that you

177
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,839
know that was just crazy simply paid

178
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:43,449
like eighteen nineteen hundred free that

179
00:11:43,449 --> 00:11:44,980
was thanks to the kindness of Dave

180
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:51,360
Kennedy gifting us off to a podcast so

181
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,980
it was really cool right and he was

182
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,749
massively behind it so so we're quite

183
00:11:58,749 --> 00:12:01,569
lucky in that sense and I guess the the

184
00:12:01,569 --> 00:12:03,430
idea is that what we do want to do like

185
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,870
more things like this where we can raise

186
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:07,240
money for good cause it's a baby do our

187
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,139
own fundraisers and just help and the

188
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:12,699
money goes to help people the community

189
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:16,089
so other causes of we support or invest

190
00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:17,620
money to you know there's this plans

191
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,829
that I build light labs proper labs for

192
00:12:20,829 --> 00:12:27,129
people but just like you know just an

193
00:12:27,129 --> 00:12:29,499
area where we can test theories out or

194
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:32,529
we can you know we could do work on okay

195
00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:41,379
how do you like maybe starts out an

196
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:43,209
information security actually proper pen

197
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:52,749
testing maybe in a it's just it's really

198
00:12:52,749 --> 00:12:54,610
about the community coming together

199
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:58,179
sharing knowledge and so if somebody

200
00:12:58,179 --> 00:13:01,929
wants to join the many hats club do they

201
00:13:01,929 --> 00:13:05,410
have to pay the $150 membership per year

202
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:09,100
fee as well as the facilitation of

203
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,310
booking fee

204
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:14,449
[Music]

205
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,860
me and I will give you details I will

206
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,080
also include free use of Google for the

207
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:30,780
air so yeah it's a great deal but so Stu

208
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,850
what is what is sort of membership in

209
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:49,050
the many hats club look likely good very

210
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:50,610
rare it's the only artistry parts you

211
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:51,530
had this year

212
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:54,000
yes on the eve of beer calm one of

213
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,120
course we have to have an average that's

214
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:01,260
sort of on zooms which which is amazing

215
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,660
that the that you're affecting figured

216
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,780
out what we could do as we've got close

217
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:18,290
to that half-hour mark before the show I

218
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:22,770
think there's gonna be fundraisers and I

219
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:27,000
think that's gonna be I never want this

220
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,910
to be enough to pay for it think right

221
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:34,260
yes he should be free community

222
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,410
shouldn't be choice

223
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,790
so what are some of the huge success

224
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:41,160
stories of the many hats Club like

225
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,200
everything some people that's joined and

226
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,360
then went on to do some amazing things

227
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,090
or like how do you see sort of this

228
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:51,060
being the snowball that that builds so

229
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:56,960
it's quite interesting actually I did

230
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,460
home story behind this so I haven't got

231
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:03,420
a non-story sure it's sometimes it's

232
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,080
phenomenal

233
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,550
and I get quite I have to pinch myself

234
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,770
and say Jesus of crates when there's

235
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:10,860
actually you know BOTS someone ever

236
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,060
thought banging first a join the

237
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,339
community and has now got their first

238
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:17,190
job and I'm like such an amazing

239
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,330
accomplishment

240
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:19,070
really

241
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,470
and then of course at the same time I've

242
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:24,230
got people have come together who you

243
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,270
know like the the people that now they

244
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:29,180
become my friends like psycho fire king

245
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,920
in drag for example it's a great example

246
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,880
of that

247
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,800
there's people have met each other wrong

248
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,750
anyhow attack we've now done projects

249
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,430
together I've got often spun off new

250
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:40,640
communities all gone off and done

251
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,130
research together for example right and

252
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:45,590
release that research and it's just like

253
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,690
collaboration and a scale that you know

254
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:50,210
I didn't think was never my intention

255
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:52,430
and it's a nice it's a nice happy

256
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:56,030
accident right and then it's like we did

257
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:59,530
like a couple years ago we did last year

258
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:02,890
you didn't like it

259
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:07,070
what hasn't the highlight for you how to

260
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:11,240
help do you weep and then they just

261
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,380
didn't have to talk like in many houses

262
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:18,500
I learned about this I changed my career

263
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:23,360
or release of research or I'm now

264
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,370
actually know what what's doing I'm part

265
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:27,080
of the community and I'm proud of being

266
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,360
part of the community and we sometimes

267
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,220
get called the many house club cult all

268
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,710
the many hats cults

269
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,850
there's a big following people that

270
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,830
really join the community that there

271
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:42,890
every day one every day people come back

272
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,360
and they're there and they're

273
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,950
contributing or they're joining voices

274
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,900
or they're you know they're doing some

275
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:53,810
research or and it's great and you know

276
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:56,120
and it's not it's not about me it's

277
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,010
about community it's about what they're

278
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:00,800
doing it's about how they are using as a

279
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,650
platform to help themselves knowledge

280
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,480
and I think that's that's important

281
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:12,050
thing really you know trying to build a

282
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:13,880
community for the sake of building

283
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,199
community it's about making it useful

284
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,280
for people I'm trying to go all we don't

285

295
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:00,940
really made a good name for themselves

296
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,620
it's don't the community but it's not

297

00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,990
about the community everyone sees the

316
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:58,990
negative side on Twitter I think you

317
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:03,370
know and we're with a you know Austin

318
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:05,140
it's how you deal those issues and how

319
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,200
you try and change with a big community

320
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,280
you're always gonna get people to come

321
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,320
in and cause issues and it's about how

322
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,480
you deal with that and we have such a

323
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:24,310
strong code of conduct we don't we try

324
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:28,050
