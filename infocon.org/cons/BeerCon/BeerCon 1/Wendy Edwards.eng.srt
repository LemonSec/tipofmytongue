1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,480
okay so without further ado can we bring

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,150
Wendi upwards into the into the chat I

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,730
think we can I think we can Wendy would

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,840
you mind on muting your microphone

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,060
yes good evening one day hello Wendy I

6
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,580
are you okay how are you doing boy how

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,890
are you yeah pretty good things seem to

8
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,949
be going okay so far we just had a chat

9
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:28,439
with Chris Quebec er about internal

10
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,740
systems and all that kind of stuff which

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,230
was really interesting now I've got a

12
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,910
question for you because we've known

13
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,260
each other on Twitter for probably about

14
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,100
18 months I think the one thing that

15
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,530
really struck me when I saw your Twitter

16
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,899
profile was that you you call yourself

17
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:50,070
an an ass of data not oh yeah yeah so I

18
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,780
wonder if you wouldn't mind giving us a

19
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,969
little bit what that actually means

20
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:56,360
because to me that sounds fascinating

21
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,949
it's so an actually you know so that so

22
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:01,079
I've actually gotten people who assume

23
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,870
that I work for NASA and I don't ok so

24
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,540
so the NASA data knots is a program

25
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,729
where people can that allows people

26
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:10,650
people enjoying it and learn more about

27
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,320
data science cool so it's like I've

28
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,049
gotten to travel through the

29
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:18,119
headquarters a few times and hey we have

30
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,130
something called water cooler chats

31
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,920
where people present sessions just

32
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,930
usually related to data science a they

33
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,220
talked about machine learning and stuff

34
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,950
and so it's in I just met some really

35
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,650
wonderful people through there does you

36
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,170
work contribute to the the furthering of

37
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,530
what NASA does or how does that work ok

38
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,619
so it's gonna do thing we we don't work

39
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,740
for NASA and so we can't do so they

40
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,899
can't specifically request us to do

41
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:48,570
projects for them because the rules

42
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:52,259
prohibit it but we we have participated

43
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,570
in their citizen science challenges so

44
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:55,890
there's something called the NASA space

45
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,079
apps challenge his I know if anybody out

46
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,840
here has participated in that not me but

47
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,490
I'm guessing people will say so actually

48
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:07,290
have yeah oh no I haven't but I was just

49
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,229
gonna say agreeing that these are the

50
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:11,160
type of program

51
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,910
that we want to bring to light for for

52
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:18,090
the audience and so I guess what I'm

53
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,220
trying to say is this is a great

54
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,770
initiative and it's just your program

55
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,960
that you've come up with no it's not my

56
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,210
program NASA space apps challenge is

57
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,120
actually a separate program that's

58
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,850
that's also run by NASA but who keeps it

59
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,230
David knots have gotten together to

60
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,760
participate in the NASA space apps

61
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,860
challenge and that's really good that's

62
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,240
really kind of neat it's sort of a

63
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,330
citizen science hackathon that uses that

64
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,540
very often uses NASA and other data to

65
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,420
address problems related to Earth and

66
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,910
space to actually Earthlings basics

67
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,000
exploration so for example um this year

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,700
one of the challenge of the challenges

69
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,880
related to ocean trash and rising water

70
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,150
levels they do actually quite a lot with

71
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,890
a lot of challenges related to climate

72
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:08,010
change and I guess when people think of

73
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,140
NASA to begin with obviously the the

74
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,360
name is National Aeronautics and Space

75
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,090
Administration and I think people

76
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,520
presumably think that's just about

77
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,760
sending people in rockets to space but

78
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,350
but I know but I'm not that familiar

79
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,209
with the work but I do know that they do

80
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:26,640
a hell of a lot more than that they do

81
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,130
look at like you say the things that are

82
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:35,010
going on on the planet the planet is

83
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,130
well mister they send satellites into

84
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:41,280
space the tape that basically do a lot

85
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,830
of imagery and remotes and so a lot of

86
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:44,730
times you're talking about

87
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,380
when you talk about the satellite

88
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,790
pictures a lot of times that falls under

89
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,590
the category some people remote sensing

90
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:52,410
right and they do impact a whole lot of

91
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,989
processing on it so I mean there are

92
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:58,800
things I think the world but they I

93
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,930
can't remember them on top of my head

94
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,400
sorry but it's like there are things you

95
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,360
can um there are pretty bizarre stuff

96
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,190
but web-based explores and stuff you

97
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,690
call up and view a whole lot of data

98
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,770
about Earth okay like you can view uh

99
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:15,900
you can view the satellite images even

100
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,228
view temperature you can view

101
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:24,560
information about winds even view

102
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,810
algae in the ocean if there's just all

103
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,030
kinds of stuff sounds fascinating

104
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:33,229
it really is and there's there's also

105
00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:36,439
something called unit that has a lot of

106
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:38,749
information related to basically

107
00:04:38,749 --> 00:04:41,779
disasters Brian okay you can view that

108
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:44,689
too so it's so in a sense their interest

109
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:46,039
in Earth is basically because they can

110
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:47,900
send satellites up into the atmosphere

111
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,090
that will turn around take pictures of

112
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,830
the earth and sent and we learn a whole

113
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,539
lot from those from that imagery that

114
00:04:53,539 --> 00:04:56,900
they speak I mean in fact like some of

115
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,990
the NASA some of the outer space photos

116
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,629
helped quite a bit like with real time

117
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:05,000
disaster management because like for

118
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,650
example you've got a tsunami or a wild

119
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:12,080
fire or a flood or something those

120
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,150
satellites are taking real-time pictures

121
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:18,800
of what's going on it's very helpful for

122
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,129
people I guess climatologists and people

123
00:05:22,129 --> 00:05:24,830
I guess even things like predicting the

124
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,909
weather and things that are going to

125
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:28,330
happen in the next couple of days you

126
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,879
know it's obviously the planet's climate

127
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:34,909
is very important this is subject that's

128
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:36,800
in the news and on people's lips all the

129
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:43,490
time I mean it's like like the these

130
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,469
disasters and extreme weather and stuff

131
00:05:45,469 --> 00:05:47,300
they're they're getting worse and more

132
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,949
frequent and the amount of money we're

133
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:50,509
spending on them is getting a lot higher

134
00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:53,080
yeah sure it is

135
00:05:53,080 --> 00:06:01,969
it's like great a sunburn is not long so

136
00:06:01,969 --> 00:06:04,339
I mean and this is interesting Wendy cuz

137
00:06:04,339 --> 00:06:06,259
do you find yourself now sort of in the

138
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:09,439
middle between the technology world and

139
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:13,879
a world that is busy changing and it's

140
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:16,939
sort of what maybe is your role in in

141
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:19,460
this do you are you a keep the lights on

142
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,430
person or are you a looking at the

143
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:25,370
future and trying to guess where we're

144
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:28,639
going to be act so interpreting what I

145
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,169
do so I actually am a software developer

146
00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:33,889
so in terms of at work and so so in

147
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:36,349
terms of that I would say both I mean

148
00:06:36,349 --> 00:06:37,910
it's like I maintain a lot

149
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,590
that's there but I mean I think about

150
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,360
what are our future needs gonna be and

151
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,000
what are we gonna need for that so

152
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,100
obviously with these giant datasets are

153
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,670
you using cloud or on-premise

154
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:51,470
infrastructure to to manipulate and to

155
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:54,290
kind of like dig deep into the data

156
00:06:54,290 --> 00:07:02,170
science side of things we actually have

157
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:04,370
sequel servers that are hosted somewhere

158
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:09,500
else okay so I mean as far as what

159
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,800
that's so so basically we're not using a

160
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,040
WMS or a server we're using a sequel

161
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,490
server that is technically hope run it

162
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,900
was technically hosted I believe out of

163
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,260
Chicago all right and you're located

164
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,260
what part is it so so I'm looking it I

165
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,940
don't know anybody's fort of Champaign
