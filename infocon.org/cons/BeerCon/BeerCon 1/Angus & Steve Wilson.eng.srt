1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,330
coming back at you with - I would say

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,520
forces to be reckoned with in the

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,010
community folks that contribute a number

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,630
of different ways we're talking about

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,519
Angus and Steve Wilson

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,730
Angus give us an introduction we shall

7
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,580
yeah yeah Grafton good evening good

8
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,320
night yes Ronald

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:25,230
so I'm on Angus rate I have been working

10
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,480
in intersects the last three years but a

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,010
different start I've been I'm a

12
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,949
technical recruiter my background I

13
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,600
served a certain time in the British

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,450
military did some tours and then I did

15
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:37,469
six years in physical security

16
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:40,530
contracting promptly in Eastern West

17
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,440
Africa and in the Middle East and then

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,950
sort of my stars aligned I met with our

19
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,219
current CEO or work with Marcello Mansur

20
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:53,579
and I've been working in cybersecurity

21
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:56,190
recruiting since since then about three

22
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,699
years now beautiful and Steve Wilson as

23
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:02,969
your see your signature person it

24
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:04,830
doesn't seem to be a conference without

25
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,900
a lock-picking village how are you this

26
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,320
morning

27
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,890
yeah yeah had some sleep what was up

28
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,780
listening quite late and kind of dozed

29
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,369
off I've had some technical issues this

30
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:15,900
morning but I hope things are working

31
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,430
now and you can hear me all right

32
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,740
so far a loud and clear good good good

33
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,220
good okay keep doing then also a bit of

34
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,049
a military background for you as well as

35
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:27,840
throughout Steve not so much I mean I

36
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,880
was a civil servant I worked a Ministry

37
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,590
of Defence but but never never anywhere

38
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,450
near the sharp end you know I was always

39
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,549
always at the back I didn't technology

40
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:37,920
together you know the people slightly

41
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,960
more Barry for the knife would use up

42
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,630
front but yeah it's been interesting one

43
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,990
and then yes I've been hacking things

44
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,549
ever since

45
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:50,729
exactly so Angus I guess we'll start

46
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:54,720
sort of broad overview of you know 2019

47
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,549
what were your impressions of it was it

48
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,469
a good year for you was the challenging

49
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:01,200
here it was a I'll be honest it was it

50
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,560
was a it was a pretty challenging year

51
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,500
now I I mainly do re technically

52
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,419
advanced creating normally in the US

53
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:12,640
market so we do everything from like

54
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,430
engineering architecture consulting

55
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,800
stuff like vitamin D fi our pain tasting

56
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,620
and then babble in a bit of sea level as

57
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,480
well it's been a it's been an

58
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,920
interesting year

59
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,750
you know you quickly learn in this game

60
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,720
that just because clients have open

61
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,160
positions doesn't mean actually hiring

62
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,050
yeah but uh it's a little well I I was

63
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,450
made to attend summer camp and then I

64
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:42,630
had a bit of a situation with CBP and

65
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,790
came home straight away but no it's been

66
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,980
good years ended well we had Vsauce kept

67
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,640
on yesterday rescue Becca was with us a

68
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,430
lot of great talks we had a singer from

69
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:58,480
sales Post who gave us ever a Wi-Fi

70
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,890
hacking workshop which was really really

71
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,050
good and now it's been awesome I think I

72
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,880
also found my feet with many hats Club

73
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,930
this year and I tried berry act as many

74
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:10,510
people into tmht as I can because it's a

75
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,489
it's an awesome group of people it's an

76
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:14,950
awesome resource and it doesn't matter

77
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:18,010
what level of competence you are in this

78
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,870
game you know I'm starting to learn a

79
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,079
bit of you know forensics and oceans and

80
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:25,930
stuff and and the Iman TMS she is just

81
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,989
awesome it doesn't matter how how how

82
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:31,989
basic your your question is there's

83
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:34,360
always someone to help out so no it's

84
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,010
been it's been it's been a tricky here

85
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,410
but it's Indiana on a good note which is

86
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,440
which is which is what matters I want to

87
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,090
talk a little bit about that Angus

88
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,239
because I think you know I talked about

89
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,280
my sort of view of the industry and I

90
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,549
think that recruiters that have a bit of

91
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:54,220
a technical background and can really

92
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,220
work with the customer to get a job spec

93
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,560
that that that is accurate to the

94
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,450
position that they're looking for is

95
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,680
truly you know the height of the art

96
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,180
yeah it's interesting thing it's like so

97
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,760
when we win win win there it's a new

98
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,260
client or an existing client comes to us

99
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,720
and say hey with some clients we'll just

100
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,720
have like an open open Rick so if we see

101
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,399
position on their website we just missed

102
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,110
and say hey can we run with us and they

103
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,050
say yeah sure

104
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,539
and but with new clients what really

105
00:04:26,539 --> 00:04:27,889
happens is they say hey we need

106
00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:30,159
assistance with let's say a

107
00:04:30,159 --> 00:04:32,020
infrastructure security engineering

108
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:36,409
position and the reason that I ask the

109
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:40,370
the dollar is because they the internal

110
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,110
teams are struggling to find people and

111
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,479
there's a very big there's like a very

112
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,669
big competition between internal and

113
00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:48,530
external critters base but it's hide

114
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,060
each other but both work together

115
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:54,440
because common good but when we when I

116
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,120
get a job spec I'll run through it I

117
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,389
will highlight some key points but

118
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:00,770
that's still not the position we didn't

119
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,509
do a call with a client and I sweets I'm

120
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:04,129
gonna say what is the what is the crux

121
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:06,349
of this position what is critical cool

122
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:08,719
about this position what up goes what I

123
00:05:08,719 --> 00:05:11,030
know goes and then suddenly that page in

124
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,550
half subscription comes down to about 15

125
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:16,009
lines and then what you start speaking

126
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:17,750
to people and sending them over to

127
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,270
clients that job Rick's suddenly becomes

128
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,969
even smaller and then it's a when you

129
00:05:22,969 --> 00:05:24,530
start sending people in and you start

130
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:25,879
getting feedback when yes it's exactly

131
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:28,190
what looking for or a little bit less

132
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,349
this a little bit more of this tweet

133
00:05:30,349 --> 00:05:32,990
this type of take that's when you truly

134
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,909
find out what the position is but yeah

135
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:38,419
job Rick's straw brakes or extremely

136
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:40,340
extremely misleading some of our clients

137
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,919
have invested a lot in just job

138
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:45,830
descriptions one of our clients actually

139
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:49,580
has a technical writer on the team that

140
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,330
writes very in-depth job descriptions

141
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:55,819
but yeah it's a it's likely resumes it's

142
00:05:55,819 --> 00:05:57,949
not in the either beholder some some job

143
00:05:57,949 --> 00:05:59,810
Rick's work and some not and the I guess

144
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,050
lost you'll say on that is that it's

145
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,099
important people understand when they

146
00:06:04,099 --> 00:06:05,240
look at their job rake it is not

147
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,289
necessarily a break for one position a

148
00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:12,740
lot of times to get the word out more

149
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,569
and to attract more people

150
00:06:14,569 --> 00:06:18,139
job it so sometimes very generalized so

151
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:20,569
the idea is it's one job rake but

152
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:21,289
there's actually three different

153
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:23,509
positions that are sort of in line with

154
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:27,379
it but there's there's various parts as

155
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:29,330
long as you fill it by a fair amount by

156
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,379
about sixty percent

157
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:32,899
you've got a shot at that position but

158
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:35,180
yeah it's always important to be careful

159
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,670
with certain job descriptions this

160
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:41,110
and just I'll jump it if I may yeah I

161
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,670
like many people in our industry I get

162
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,460
bombarded with LinkedIn messages from

163
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,070
recruiters and stuff and there's a

164
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:52,040
manager in InfoSec I also get bombarded

165
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,770
with recruiters wanting to sell sell

166
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:57,860
people to me yeah and one thing I do see

167
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,540
that's common and in factory and you've

168
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,070
got a brilliant anecdote on this as well

169
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:04,340
just touch on is organisations on their

170
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,070
own on their own two feet find it in my

171
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,170
experience if possible to recruit

172
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,390
intersect people because they don't know

173
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,080
what they're doing

174
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,810
yeah and what you often find and this is

175
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,370
a reference to a and he shared an

176
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,080
example with the bear farmers a couple

177
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,110
of months ago his organization's attempt

178
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,260
to recruit to a single position but try

179
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,150
and recruit four or five different roles

180
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,280
into that one position so you'll often

181
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,350
see that they want the threat hunter or

182
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:33,380
analyst stability manager or they want

183
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,940
the risk manager in a compliance officer

184
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,410
and everything all rolled into one

185
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:39,410
position and unfortunately although we

186
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,990
may have bits of that skill in our

187
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,120
portfolio we're not we're not all of

188
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,010
those things and I think that to me

189
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,720
presents a real problem in recruiting

190
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,220
into the industry what were your

191
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:55,880
thoughts Anderson yeah so our anything

192
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,250
so our company wear blue security has

193
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,990
been going about five years sort of

194
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:02,890
creating a bit in the UK and then it

195
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:09,290
folks warned us and I am a lot of the

196
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,110
things that a lot of other recruiting

197
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:14,690
agents seized see as they unique selling

198
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:17,840
points is what we use as negatives so a

199
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,460
lot of companies would never want to

200
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:27,260
hire a lot of people she was like come

201
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:31,750
to the m20 racism is a weak position and

202
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,490
does that any other and in the end that

203
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:37,010
just creates more spam in the point of

204
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,929
contacts email box that means more

205
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:40,429
people have to be interviewed and less

206
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:42,740
we're getting hired and what we do is we

207
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,870
spent a lot of time in doing research we

208
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,660
spend a lot of time speaking to two key

209
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,250
players in the industry to understand

210
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,900
what we're actually looking for

211
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,630
sure it's it's very easy to do a call

212
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,670
with someone and that talk lot of

213
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,110
technical jargon and you don't have a

214
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,490
scooby-doo what they're talking about

215
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:01,040
you can you can get away with that to a

216
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,200
certain degree but I've got to put know

217
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,610
where I'm confident of where someone

218
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,470
mentions technology that I don't have

219
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:13,279
never heard of and what happens is we

220
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,610
we're very we do very small brain is

221
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,740
recruiting so some of our best client

222
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:24,920
and we will give that but we get a near

223
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,740
one-to-one interview ratio and sometimes

224
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,470
new clients are a bit over the English

225
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,480
work on sweaters if he they're a bit

226
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,920
like I don't know if you're the right

227
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,050
company to work with us but within about

228
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,700
three to four weeks they realize that

229
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,740
almost everyone we're sending them is

230
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,480
getting through interview stage one two

231
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,610
three four and you know they're going on

232
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,290
site and people are getting offered and

233
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:48,920
I think that's why it's important to to

234
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,640
choose who you do your recruiting with

235
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,980
because it's a it's a it's a it's a it's

236
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,140
a it's an interesting game but it's

237
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,580
there's a lot of there's a lot of

238
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:01,160
nonsense out there um I think I get

239
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,370
offered about three to four C so jobs a

240
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,190
week because people look at my job title

241
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,900
they see the industry I'm in and they're

242
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:12,589
like they send out a mass in mail to 400

243
00:10:12,589 --> 00:10:14,390
people and that's just something that we

244
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:17,120
refused to do because once again it

245
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,560
might work for you short term but long

246
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:26,839
term damaging your grip tight mission if

247
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:29,230
I'm Oh

248
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,670
news I saw something we did with this

249
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:36,250
that and I yes I wasn't open yeah oh

250
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,700
it's good

251
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,440
just continue because I was going to

252
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,270
jump over to Steve and talk about his

253
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:45,819
recruiting experiences and definitely

254
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,070
you'll be stepping yeah Steve come on in

255
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:52,070
well so I'm a terrible person to ask

256
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:55,100
about this because I mean I'm world

257
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,779
right so I don't want these people it

258
00:10:56,779 --> 00:10:58,220
jumps around see them what first job I

259
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,950
did 11 years and I thought that was a

260
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,570
job for life the next job you know when

261
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:03,920
we did five four that's to come

262
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,629
I've dropped I've been in the controller

263
00:11:05,629 --> 00:11:08,269
was it getting on for nine now no no no

264
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:11,119
intention to move I've heard a lot

265
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:14,269
though no I worked out I've managed to

266
00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:16,009
stop the recruitment people talking to

267
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:19,249
me pretty much at all if I apply one

268
00:11:19,249 --> 00:11:21,049
clever trick which is no so I used to

269
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:23,029
everybody else I used to but you know

270
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:25,100
before last left right and center I just

271
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,329
point out for them that I know more

272
00:11:26,329 --> 00:11:27,619
people than they do I know the rules

273
00:11:27,619 --> 00:11:28,850
they were Chris before and if I could

274
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,649
direct I'll get their fee paid me is it

275
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:32,899
joining bonus so why would I why would I

276
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:38,119
want recruiter really sorry it's not

277
00:11:38,119 --> 00:11:41,540
argument but yeah I see value in you

278
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,709
know if you're new to the industry I

279
00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:44,629
mean again this is why I get involved in

280
00:11:44,629 --> 00:11:46,220
things like conferences and cyber

281
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,109
challenges and stuff like that is you

282
00:11:48,109 --> 00:11:49,939
know I'm all for getting more people in

283
00:11:49,939 --> 00:11:51,889
the industry because frankly the less

284
00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:53,419
work for me to do with that the happier

285
00:11:53,419 --> 00:11:55,850
I am but you know I mean there

286
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,129
definitely is you know again you know

287
00:11:58,129 --> 00:12:00,079
there's so much work going and there's

288
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,480
so many people so sorry with it more

289
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,980
from a mentoring point a fury no I meant

290
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,480
the people I try and help people where I

291
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,059
can and get people involved and no

292
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:10,220
offense to Angus I try the voice

293
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,839
recruiters because because again it's

294
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,279
not it's not something I'm looking for

295
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:19,100
no no it used to be personally but it's

296
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,660
not to see people doing it well coming

297
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,679
up the other thing of course you know

298
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:23,989
you you hear so many stories you know

299
00:12:23,989 --> 00:12:27,589
horror stories of of barbeque does so

300
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:28,730
like I say it's nice to see people

301
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:30,139
approaching it you know more

302
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:33,529
professionally well I think one of the

303
00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:36,199
things that I've noticed is that there's

304
00:12:36,199 --> 00:12:39,709
now a pretty heavy emphasis on the tech

305
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:42,230
resume you know the little paragraph

306
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:45,980
about me followed by you know a

307
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,529
highlight of some of these acts of how

308
00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:57,649
it how important is that Angus so one

309
00:12:57,649 --> 00:12:59,720
thing that most agencies do when they

310
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,929
get

311
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:13,210
razor may they will oh please stop it

312
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,910
and put it into a format like the

313
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,730
accompany their company's format use

314
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:24,040
their hey they pull it all the things

315
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,230
that the sometimes a race table will

316
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:30,100
give people some advice but we prefer to

317
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,320
sit a resume as it is because it is in

318
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,730
the end the day a personal reflection on

319
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:40,570
this candidate story I've seen I've seen

320
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:44,350
some amazing amazing resumes and I've

321
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:47,040
seen some action

322
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:53,170
Judy table raised nice and the the the

323
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:56,769
bit resumes you know I think it's an

324
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,410
that and it has like ratings on it they

325
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:00,850
look really good and if you've got

326
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,470
experience due to the back up what you

327
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:05,769
say you can do then it looks really good

328
00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:10,959
I'm not that bothered with areas formats

329
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,610
of resume as long as communicates

330
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:16,269
accurately what you but you have done in

331
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:17,920
the past what you're doing currently and

332
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,360
what you would like to do in the future

333
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,970
and the problem comes in is when someone

334
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:24,130
over states their abilities

335
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,410
i I've got a fairly good enough for

336
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,420
someone that is going to be good at job

337
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:32,200
export or why but I must detail

338
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,720
sometimes and you know then those people

339
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,490
get through and the problem is you can

340
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:40,540
try pull the wool over for myself and

341
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,730
saw you you'll come right and you'll

342
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,680
come up with many other critters but at

343
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,990
some point doing a technical screen or

344
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,360
doing an on-site you're gonna be found

345
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,810
so it's it's just be straight forward

346
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:55,720
and honest but um the new style of tech

347
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:00,040
resume is is very easy on I I quite like

348
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,709
them but it's it's put your own slavery

349
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:06,130
into it is what I would say yeah cool

350
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,199
so Steve I want to talk a little bit

351
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:10,810
about it you brought up the idea of

352
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,940
conferences and encouraging people to go

353
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,790
to conferences do you see a lot of

354
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,940
active recruiting going on or DC a lot

355
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:22,690
of networking opportunities I'm forever

356
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,699
saying you know it's not about what you

357
00:15:24,699 --> 00:15:27,370
know it was all about networking and I

358
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,290
mean I've been on a horribly social

359
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:31,870
clients it's hardware seventies you run

360
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,430
the likely turntable that everyone

361
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,649
enjoys but again glass a great excuse

362
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:37,870
you know that because I can I can sit

363
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,190
and explain things to people and it

364
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,750
gives me an avenue to start talking

365
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,250
people and something to you know to

366
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,589
engage about but yeah like I said I'm

367
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:47,380
again I'm involved in running some local

368
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,790
Def Con groups that sort of stuff so

369
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,680
someone one bit of advice for people is

370
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,779
always you know get yourself involved in

371
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:54,880
the community somehow you know people of

372
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,710
the local group you know getting

373
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:00,590
a bit of conference but I don't think I

374
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,600
you know I will definitely encourage

375
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,070
people is you know get involved in the

376
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,110
organization I mean you know I've been

377
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,760
helping run conferences for the best

378
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,070
part of 20 years and you know I've never

379
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,510
done one where I thought we've got far

380
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,010
too much help here like I could do with

381
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:16,190
fewer people and a lot picking so you

382
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,780
know this is a case in point I mean

383
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,220
again you know we've been putting an

384
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,300
awful lot of effort you know where

385
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,860
they're really setting up you know

386
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,870
transport all the stuff we've got a

387
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,000
running all day and often that means you

388
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,500
know defense you know I might not see

389
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,760
anything other than the inside a

390
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,470
lock-picking room so again the more

391
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,910
bodies I can get the help you know the

392
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,220
more we can spread the work around and

393
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,870
I've had some wonderful helpers yeah you

394
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,850
know I could not have done be a number

395
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,110
of events I've done this year without

396
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,240
without being a copious number of

397
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,220
helpers far too many to list the time

398
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,100
we've got left and I thank each and

399
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,870
every one of them but yeah you know

400
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:50,200
people people get involved help out

401
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:54,050
attend meet people and you know careers

402
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:58,550
will grow from that yeah it's it's it's

403
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,250
been a tiring year you know we've done

404
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,230
this year comparatively you know

405
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,680
massively more than years gone by and I

406
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,970
think next year is only going to be

407
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,619
busier but but again if if anybody's

408
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:11,690
interested in you know helping out with

409
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,339
anyone I could maybe not talk me about

410
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:15,650
but on the lock picking sides you know

411
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:16,730
if you want to get involved and come and

412
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:19,099
help like what I will definitely talk to

413
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:22,369
you and take you up on it it's yeah it's

414
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:23,930
worthwhile you know I get a lot with it

415
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:25,459
and I would encourage other people to

416
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:27,619
get involved in my ocean

417
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:29,270
I certainly was blown away when you

418
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:32,000
showed me the four-digit combination

419
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,330
lock vulnerability where I could be into

420
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:39,230
one of those in less than 30 seconds so

421
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,820
really really interesting stuff Angus

422
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,940
you've you've obviously been doing this

423
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,950
recruiting now for for three years are

424
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:51,980
you finding that it's getting a little

425
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,830
bit easier because companies are getting

426
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:57,650
more informed or is it still really

427
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:00,520
variable companies want you know a

428
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:04,760
ridiculous skill set for a non shall we

429
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,249
say London market price

430
00:18:07,249 --> 00:18:11,610
yeah it's a it's it's it's so sporadic

431
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:14,820
and random and varied it's absolutely

432
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:19,499
unreal and it there's many factors in

433
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:22,289
has to do with culture and company it

434
00:18:22,289 --> 00:18:25,259
has to do with how they hire how they

435
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:28,289
hand out titles there's so many

436
00:18:28,289 --> 00:18:30,539
different variables in it um the best

437
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:33,090
work that I do and this is advice I can

438
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:35,759
give to any internal recruiter that that

439
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:37,950
does work with agencies like I said

440
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,149
earlier make sure you pick the right

441
00:18:39,149 --> 00:18:41,999
coming work with and and and they're a

442
00:18:41,999 --> 00:18:43,710
good company that you've chosen and

443
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,539
you've you know you've been vetted and

444
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:48,090
you force around about their having an

445
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:50,549
open relationship with us with us

446
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:53,100
recruiter send back same feedback and

447
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,259
and when when someone doesn't meet the

448
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,629
cut tell the people why they didn't meet

449
00:18:57,629 --> 00:18:59,340
the cut because that allows someone to

450
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,009
improve themselves and also if you don't

451
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:05,159
which has happened before it creates a

452
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:07,139
negative impression about us as an

453
00:19:07,139 --> 00:19:08,669
agency and it paints an even worse

454
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:11,070
impact for the client and on something

455
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:14,639
like Glassdoor but it's a maybe things

456
00:19:14,639 --> 00:19:16,679
will stabilize at some point but things

457
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:18,359
are still extremely spreading you know

458
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:20,220
that we have some clients that we work

459
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,529
force their hire fast everything goes

460
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:24,960
well and then with others it's like

461
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,029
pulling blood from stone but you know

462
00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:28,950
with my current clinical I'm quite happy

463
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,840
in quite interface we have a very small

464
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,730
number of clients but we weren't

465
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:33,889
extremely well with it

466
00:19:33,889 --> 00:19:37,619
Wow okay well thank you so much

467
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:39,720

00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,980
listening to donate we are doing well

471
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,779
but we are not in the gravy zone where

472
00:19:51,779 --> 00:19:55,169
all of a sudden a thousand becomes two

473
00:19:55,169 --> 00:19:57,450
thousand so if you could find it in your

474
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:00,659
