1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,049
oh [ __ ] yeah right we've got a wheel

2
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:06,480
Eamon is he in I don't know

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,230
did somebody wake him up well we've got

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,340
one half of the talk yes good morning

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,160
guys how you doing man I'm very well

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,840
thanks my Kinnear yeah joining us

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,480
somebody wake up Brian Ian if you would

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,699
like to entertain in the not in a

9
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,019
spiritual sense but we'd like to

10
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:30,359
entertain him while I go find that other

11
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,329
guy I'll be back in a couple of minutes

12
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:39,960
okay sounds good he's probably not even

13
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,320
home yet because of the beers but

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,140
anyways Tim what I want you to do is

15
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,770
tell everyone here on beer calm one a

16
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,590
little bit about you a little bit about

17
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:58,949
the year you've had yeah so a little bit

18
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:03,320
about me I'm from I'm from Essex okay

19
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,680
grew up here in the UK was a ski bum for

20
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,729
a while after a run after dropping out

21
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:12,299
of high school

22
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:15,330
not quite dropping out ended up in the

23
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,650
States studying computer science

24
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,430
followed the kind of software

25
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,610
development track ended up managing

26
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:26,220
teams of people and kind of that's the

27
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,560
that's the track that led me to where I

28
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,990
am now so part of what I was doing one

29
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,400
of the things that I got involved in was

30
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,030
a niche area applications of speech

31
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,150
recognition technology very niche market

32
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:44,790
right through me into call centre

33
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:50,729
technology which in turn so taking

34
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:52,259
credit cards over their phone for

35
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:55,619
example right and so that they led me

36
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:58,380
into the world of security that's saying

37
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,060
how do we actually protect this type of

38
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,689
stuff I was working with with a small

39
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:06,810
kind of forty person company and we went

40
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,970
through and we went through kind of 9001

41
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,038
standards we went through 27001

42
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,120
standards we went through PCI compliant

43
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,190
so that's kind of my my journey if you

44
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:20,610
like your arc my arc and it was an

45
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,170
interesting one because it's always been

46
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,019
technology oriented with you know

47
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:29,159
software being the the main backdrop but

48
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:31,549
they're being responsible for kind of as

49
00:02:31,549 --> 00:02:35,420
quote-unquote CTO CEO of a small company

50
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,599
responsible for the infrastructure and

51
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,799
fundamentally of course you know comes

52
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:44,099
down to the people that you hire and the

53
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:46,829
people that you trust anyway have you've

54
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:51,390
done that for what I decided to to drop

55
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:57,150
out of that I was I was uninspired if

56
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:02,000
you like by by the call center space by

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,790
trying to improve call center experience

58
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:08,609
right and so I really started to look at

59
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:10,890
well what do I want to do next and what

60
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,040
can I do that would be interesting and

61
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,370
useful from from you know societal you

62
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,440
know socially responsible humanistic

63
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:25,200
perspective going well actually I'm

64
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,030
interested in the security space let's

65
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,180
go study it some more and I did that and

66
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,660
and I I brought I brought to it my grin

67
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:38,430
to it I guess my 30-plus year in 30 plus

68
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:41,160
years of experience in terms of managing

69
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,819
people and processes and organizations

70
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:47,699
and so I take the I come from the

71
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:51,989
government perspective from how do we

72
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:53,940
help companies for my business now

73
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,220
having set up my own consultancy

74
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,359
business is all about helping companies

75
00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:03,239
improve their security posture so I want

76
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:04,709
to talk a little bit about that because

77
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:09,900
for me I think a lot of the sort of

78
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,269
education that's happening out there in

79
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:18,738
cyber security is a little bit it's not

80
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:21,988
representative of the real thing and and

81
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:23,790
what I mean by that and

82
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,860
maybe you might have some insight into

83
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,850
this is it is very rare in information

84
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:33,210
security or IT in general that you get a

85
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,980
Greenfield that in fact you inherit

86
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:41,520
somebody else's mass and so you know

87
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,530
what we have is a lot of folks coming

88
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:47,670
out with CIS spch other designations

89
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:51,710
that have expectations around

90
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:55,920
cybersecurity based on the idea of a lab

91
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,020
experience right whereas the reality is

92
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,720
you're gonna find those things that are

93
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,730
just horrific right yeah absolutely and

94
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,640
I guess one of the one of the aspects

95
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,000
that I enjoy of what I do with and you

96
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,740
know let me just be clear here you know

97
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,750
I may have my sis

98
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,400
credential I went off and got that

99
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,980
certification of course everybody makes

100
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,600
jokes about it and I understand that

101
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,200
because for me sis was just like her I

102
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,530
needed to have something sure and I had

103
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,900
some you know and I had some valid

104
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,090
experience behind me in terms of

105
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:40,050
security governance and management but

106
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,480
it was just the tip of the iceberg right

107
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,000
and this is such a broad and deep topic

108
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,570
that I'm I'm here to learn and you know

109
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:51,390
I'm very fortunate to have found you in

110
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:54,540
to have found other people like Daniel

111
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:58,800
card no we talked about b-sides London

112
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,650
just previously I showed up there an

113
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,930
exon you guys there heard some great

114
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,420
talks there's a whole community here

115
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:10,220
that are very supportive encouraging

116
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:14,280
kind noble in terms of their actions and

117
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,150
I'm here to learn one of the things I

118
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,700
have done and you know that's a message

119
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,190
I guess that is important for everyone

120
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,720
in this space is just to keep learning

121
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,690
and I keep I keep hearing it from people

122
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:29,370
keep learning keep pushing yourself

123
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:32,490
learn some new particular area one of

124
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,350
the interesting things for me is I get

125
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,490
to sit down with with

126
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,889
deniz and typically I'll go in and do a

127
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:41,590
couple of days on site with a new

128
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:44,229
company and I'll take them through some

129
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:47,020
kind of a gap analysis whether we're

130
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,990
looking at cyber essentials or whether

131
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,520
we're looking at twenty seven thousand

132
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,380
or PCI compliance or even gdpr from from

133
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:00,660
a standards perspective look at look at

134
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,620
different positions and then she said

135
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:08,380
inherited technical debt one might say

136
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:11,530
yeah the interesting thing is you know

137
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:14,349
having a look across lots of different

138
00:07:14,349 --> 00:07:17,500
clients I've got some I'm starting to

139
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,659
get some some kind of stats now and some

140
00:07:19,659 --> 00:07:22,240
evidence can see where who's doing good

141
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,300
at what quite you know interestingly

142
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,150
when you look across let's say the

143
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:31,380
different areas of twenty seven thousand

144
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:35,470
which is just one security standard well

145
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:39,370
what is the worst what is the worst of

146
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,620
you know as across the industry that I'm

147
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,440
seeing what are the worst areas and the

148
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:49,330
worst areas supplier management is the

149
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:51,460
worst area in terms of how people are

150
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,190
managing their suppliers and guess what

151
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:57,630
we see quite a lot of issues related to

152
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:00,969
supply chain attacks yeah you can livi

153
00:08:00,969 --> 00:08:04,960
poorly managed then the next area that

154
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,530
is kind of the weakest link is surprise

155
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,319
surprise asset management yeah it's just

156
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:17,169
not being done people you know because

157
00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:18,880
I've been sitting on both sides of this

158
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,419
fence of auditing companies but also

159
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,729
being audited so I you know I will sit

160
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:27,009
with the company with an external

161
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:28,750
auditor as they're being audited and I'm

162
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,789
trying to defend essentially the

163
00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:32,500
security management framework that we've

164
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,839
put together and my all because the

165
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:37,328
auditors come in and to be honest the

166
00:08:37,328 --> 00:08:40,510
auditors really don't understand the

167
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:44,650
technical side of things necessarily so

168
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,600
they'll be looking at asset management

169
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,980
and what they're interested in knowing

170
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,630
is

171
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,820
do you have the right tag on that laptop

172
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,700
and does that match up with your

173
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,400
hardware tag being your you know in your

174
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,260
Excel spreadsheet of your asset

175
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,050
management and and that's really not

176
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,940
doing anything in terms of reducing risk

177
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:08,060
no I really not agreed completely a

178
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:12,440
great just let's just quickly cut to

179
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,330
Brian Welton who's yes joined us he's if

180
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:18,710
you'd like to unmute your microphone

181
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,450
Brian you're not getting away with it

182
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,240
yeah no we need Brian we need some Brian

183
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,970
we go cuckoo things that need to be

184
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:31,250
taken care of so good morning Brian for

185
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,460
those of you that don't know Brian

186
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,770
he's the bear farmers manager that's

187
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:37,190
right

188
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,480
amongst other things and he'll go on

189
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,360
with that himself but Brian's job in the

190
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,100
bear farmers is basically to make sure

191
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,230
we've got the money we need to buy the

192
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:49,279
beer that we need and Belmont just yeah

193
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,320
and and all the musical equipment and

194
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,930
studio time and he drives the bus when

195
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:56,330
we do gigs and you keep us on the

196
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,680
straight and narrow you you heard

197
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,839
groupies in to the van Flores and all

198
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,209
that kind of stuff so you're an

199
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:03,920
invaluable member of the team right its

200
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,260
first few Zhu Zhu member of the team I

201
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,870
can live without Brown Brian what else

202
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,510
do you do I mean obviously looking after

203
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,730
the beer farmers is nearly full time we

204
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:16,630
pass to you 24/7 on Twitter

205
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,370
well I being where my own network

206
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:23,420
consultancy since 2004 so I mainly do

207
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,459
networking I do security as well but my

208
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:28,279
main passion his networks and security

209
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:30,920
and they like all network related it's

210
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,140
got a packet mode I mean on that or look

211
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:37,459
on there and and so you built this

212
00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:39,709
business primarily servicing what type

213
00:10:39,709 --> 00:10:42,040
of customer

214
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,589
well I've mainly work in the defense

215
00:10:45,589 --> 00:10:48,709
base in UK ok predominately I also do a

216
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:50,420
few little bits with small businesses

217
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,279
which hosting different challenges I

218
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:54,260
mean obviously mention the supply chain

219
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,630
there as well I think there's a vast

220
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,670
majority companies in this country but

221
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,050
we don't have a squatch ownership within

222
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,760
a power supply supply issue because

223
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,380
buying one switch at a time obviously

224
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,270
enterprises can be different you know

225
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,840
see the security first pretty different

226
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,250
so yes we're dummies that so it's tough

227
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,920
I can't we talk about

228
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,320
gotcha challenges are the same

229
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,200
Tim Tim talked about the importance of

230
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,520
things like asset management

231
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,030
configuration database and supply chain

232
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,550
management is this are these universal

233
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,800
problems right from enterprise down to

234
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,430
small medium business yes no I mean the

235
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,440
asset management is just the nightmare

236
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,300
for any organization they love it I'll

237
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,670
get that any interaction it and even to

238
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,920
go cyber stuff finished as head missing

239
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,260
perfect small companies I died midnight

240
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,960
I don't spend much time least to on the

241
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,510
despise Facebook I look at their

242
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,160
conferences every year now for us five

243
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,530
years and it's not whole host of smaller

244
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,990
companies out there the IT people tend

245
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,580
to be the people I perform into it

246
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:59,640
mmm-hmm trying to use it you know to leg

247
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,050
up to somewhere else there's really good

248
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:04,260
people involved and forward and they

249
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,760
don't have the luxury who haven't supply

250
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,560
chain issues because they I've done in

251
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,160
the budget

252
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,230
alright it just gets that from where

253
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,970
they can get it from they don't have any

254
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:13,980
formalized processes like a big company

255
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,810
will have you can only buy stuff from

256
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,580
these companies here well for a small

257
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,210
business huge like Murray canteen so I

258
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:27,600
yeah there are small companies and you

259
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,400
know fundamentally in terms of surprise

260
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,010
it's going to be about well what is that

261
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,750
particular supply doing for us that

262
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,670
particular service not for small

263
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,530
companies I get ups which 450-pound

264
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:40,800
cheaper from number one that's yeah but

265
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,480
also you've got a lot of small companies

266
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,670
that will outsource their IT to a

267
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:49,140
service provider no they won't because I

268
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,640
can't afford to so they've got one IT

269
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,100
guys work he's been tried his best but

270
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,140
he's not in my teeth he's just crying

271
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:59,640
for an answer they're all oh absolutely

272
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,770
but also I mean it is the case that

273
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:03,960
there's quite a lot of companies that

274
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,970
you know maybe forty person company

275
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,460
right there their business is an IT so

276
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,900
they're going to outsource it although

277
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,430
half actually say that their contracts

278
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:15,510
and some some IT cap but they don't ask

279
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,470
have any idea of what kinda the

280
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:21,300
responsibilities are of that of that

281
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,300
person or that partner should they be

282
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,980
doing patch management for their systems

283
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,500
should they give the guy domain admin

284
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,990
access to their to their systems it's

285
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,580
that kind of stuff that I was I was

286
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,990
touching on in terms of poor management

287
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:36,240
yeah I think you're right in smaller

288
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,370
companies you're gonna have an IT person

289
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:39,930
that's probably probably knows how to

290
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:42,990
manually build a file server probably

291
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,360
knows how to manually build a mail

292
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,150
server manually do this and manually do

293
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,220
that by click click click stick the CD

294
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,770
and carry on but they're not probably

295
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,630
going to be that security minded if

296
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,280
they're more around making sure things

297
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,680
are operationally functional networks

298
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,380
and file systems work and that's

299
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,240
fundamentally I cede the picture that I

300
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,150
see in nearly all companies and of

301
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:09,300
course I'm I'm seeing kind of small to

302
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:15,690
medium companies anyway well one thing

303
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,820
I've seen from my point of view I which

304
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,140
is obviously from the network point you

305
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,320
is a small company can't afford this

306
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,880
simple as that they can't afford for me

307
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,950
to go in a surface which if it's 40

308
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,420
people have spiteful equals which

309
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,490
everyone's honest map really now putting

310
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:31,110
is a service runs right to Atlanta

311
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,390
and I've seen instances where phones are

312
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,890
on the same be known as the users as the

313
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,840
service and the only problem we've got

314
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,640
with flat VLANs going right now is we've

315
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,140
got a lot more virtualized bracketed

316
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,840
cal-grant which is fantastic but they're

317
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,490
often badly implemented because the

318
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,110
virtual switch which has services

319
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,910
connect to it more often not the

320
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,380
responsibly of the server team who just

321
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,000
want your thing working they're all in

322
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,010
the same subnet so you know web server

323
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,990
which talks to the database server but

324
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:57,720
yeah I can get to both and yeah that's

325
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,160
the date basis where I want to get to

326
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,680
now normally I use against the web

327
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,390
interface webbing Facebook's the day

328
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,860
based over there reading them and

329
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,770
excavation and yeah I should not even be

330
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:10,830
able to get to ping or do what I can so

331
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:13,050
what gets a database server and I can

332
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:15,810
comprise a user machine in send X and

333
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,670
unfortunately I'm seeing more and more

334
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,500
more flat networks and that's not just

335
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,760
because lack of knowledge of small

336
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,130
business level it's because basically a

337
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,780
lack of understanding from people who

338
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:27,390
manage servers in a very much a very

339
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,590
expensive

340
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:31,900
multimillion-pound enterprise oh yeah

341
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,420
yeah that's that's the biggest fret

342
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,210
slacking treatment might is that so

343
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:38,950
but you are in the business of

344
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:41,110
implementing some simple changes right

345
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:45,070
and I think it's easy to do that when

346
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,830
you have that small medium customer I

347
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:50,230
it's much harder to do it at an

348
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,970
enterprise level correct just

349
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:54,400
effectively absolutely so would you say

350
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,850
then in a way if you can convince a

351
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,610
small business to to make the investment

352
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:03,310
and do the easy stop so maybe even cyber

353
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:06,040
security essentials do they end up being

354
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,350
a tougher target than than the

355
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:11,590
enterprise I'm a [ __ ] yeah especially

356
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:12,880
there are small with the Suncoast

357
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,040
Rossmore attack surface but also you can

358
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,320
sell the argument as a scalability by

359
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,530
creating the the subnets pretty

360
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:21,850
different the different subnets it's

361
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,160
easy to scale I mean I'm sick I'm sick

362
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,960
of answering the question on the song

363
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,300
spice what's network for which is I've

364
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,890
ran out of IP addresses what do I do

365
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:32,200
I'll just make the subnet bigger well I

366
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,820
ain't a hundred percent who ever think

367
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,470
on that subject have to change even I

368
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,300
need to change the subnet mask yeah and

369
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,980
you just create a bigger broadcast name

370
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,540
whereas if you just created another

371
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,790
submit and I quit little delay

372
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,920
you've changed nothing that's working

373
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,200
just absolute zero risk and you just

374
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,510
make an amendment and there's scales it

375
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:52,090
scales better but getting that concept

376
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,500
over to someone who doesn't understand

377
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,360
subnetting someone who doesn't

378
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,830
understand the network side of it and

379
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,210
it's just under pressure it's basically

380
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,100
put ten more machines in the network is

381
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,530
is challenged and so it's how it's sold

382
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,270
them like to say as we go with more

383
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:08,349
virtual environments the the desire not

384
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:10,150
necessarily that knowledge and desire to

385
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,699
through them I have the four different

386
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:15,040
servers in four different elevenses and

387
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,530
not the exodus don't say box only they

388
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,329
don't understand the layer to the

389
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,400
physical separation is different than

390
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,180
logical separation

391
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,670
yeah Tim are you seeing this as a

392
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:29,320
challenge as well Network segmentation I

393
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,360
would say yes

394
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,850
typically the the companies are dealing

395
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,530
with don't have you know they don't have

396
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:39,130
a lot of network segmentation other than

397
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:41,350
they're wireless networks are segmented

398
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:45,450
from their goody

399
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:48,279
well yeah I mean I guess that's that's a

400
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:51,940
start for something something so

401
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,029
gentlemen you know obviously if you're

402
00:17:55,029 --> 00:17:56,740
in a PCI environment yeah then you're

403
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,950
likely to see some segmentation that is

404
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,510
you know there is a requirement from a

405
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,590
PCI perspective

406
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:05,890
quick quick Paul Brian printers on the

407
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,120
internet good idea

408
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:12,000
Tim printers on the internet good idea

409
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,590
the first question I asked never do a

410
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:18,130
talk is there was this much yeah put

411
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,500
your hands up

412
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,179
yeah what was lost many printer and

413
00:18:22,179 --> 00:18:23,950
everyone's like it will be one person

414
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,960
always one and they say when was the

415
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,190
last time you'll create the firmware on

416
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,500
one you routed our switches yeah and you

417
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,700
just look back yeah Cisco 4k extreme HP

418
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,620
they already spirit updates very regular

419
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,409
yeah and no one updates their firewall

420
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:39,760
and we'll update snake switches just

421
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,919
down time you get downtime for patching

422
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,320
it down thanks for five minutes which oh

423
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,720
I also think I also think there's a

424
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,860
little bit of a problem where people

425
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,440
think that hardware appliances and

426
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,990
printers come into that as well or a saw

427
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:55,270
an abstract concept that look after

428
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:59,380
themselves forever you mean you're

429
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,730
telling me that the printer run the

430
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:08,020
software yeah hard drives

431
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,210
they stand up institute of great so you

432
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:11,890
can attack it I mean you get these

433
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,600
things playing doom now we own the

434
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,000
string yeah you can pivot from them

435
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,500
their program exits the phone and prints

436
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,120
over so if they're not the right subnet

437
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,710
you've just basically pivot from the

438
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:22,750
printer to find food server flying print

439
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,960
so more like it has profiles on and then

440
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,490
you've got just the profiles we access

441
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:29,080
profiles and that's another step brute

442
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,880
numeration and it's just a way of rain

443
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,679
system printers should be kept at arm's

444
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:35,230
length yeah yeah completely agree

445
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:37,450
completely agree with you so we're

446
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:38,679
wrapping up now we're into the last

447
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:42,340
minute of the of the session yeah just

448
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,770
quickly both of you maybe Brian you go

449
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:47,190
first what's coming up for you in 2020 I

450
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,539
also fight is gonna be interesting

451
00:19:49,539 --> 00:19:52,720
so lot my clients

452
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,909
the safe side just ruined that one

453
00:19:54,909 --> 00:19:56,440
inside which is not gonna work well for

454
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,820
them because they can really kind of

455
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:01,479
experience and obviously a lot of

456
00:20:01,479 --> 00:20:03,129
conferences coming up don't look up fear

457
00:20:03,129 --> 00:20:04,470
that's we're going to change next year

458
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:12,340
beautiful excellent what about eating so

459
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,340
next year for me is about learning more

460
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,599
one of the things I really want to do is

461
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:19,450
collaborate with some some of the

462
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,429
members that I've met here for example

463
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:25,029
in terms of a joint engagement because I

464
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:26,409
think that we can bring those two

465
00:20:26,409 --> 00:20:30,399
parties or bring more than one looking

466
00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:32,619
at things like throwing up for me

467
00:20:32,619 --> 00:20:33,879
learning more about Network

468
00:20:33,879 --> 00:20:35,679
administration so that's kind of Brian's

469
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:41,529
business yeah this is why we paired you

470
00:20:41,529 --> 00:20:50,499
up yeah I have repo rates we actually

471
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,379
created a collaboration synergies I love

472
00:20:53,379 --> 00:20:57,849
it alright guys so much she was much it

473
00:20:57,849 --> 00:21:00,099
was a power honor my honor to join you

474
00:21:00,099 --> 00:21:04,059
and really appreciate the many hats club

475
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:07,419
and whole security community and the

476
00:21:07,419 --> 00:21:09,359
Obamas for putting this together

477
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:12,190
yeah thanks for Noah rest up to now if

478
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,539
you can maintain that that'd be good

479
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:15,669
well that's our goal for 2020 stretch

480
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:16,179
gold

481
00:21:16,179 --> 00:21:17,710
yeah but Christmas is around the corner

482
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,609
Brown and anything goes anything

483
00:21:20,609 --> 00:21:22,899
listen chaps thank you very much free

484
00:21:22,899 --> 00:21:25,570
time much appreciated and we'll catch

485
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:28,259
you soon Cheers
