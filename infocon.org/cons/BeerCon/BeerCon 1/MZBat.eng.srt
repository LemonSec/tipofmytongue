and we're back beer con 1 continues here

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,059
with a true legend in information

3
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:17,100
security welcome Ms bot well that's good

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,710
I'm glad

5
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:23,039
3 for 15 in the warning here so I'm glad

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,330
you're in a good mood

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,630
actually it's delightful to talk to you

8
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,250
thanks for having me on and thanks for

9
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,320
doing this I hope that you meet your

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,500
charitable goals for the night to you we

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,350
are working hard and yes I thank you for

12
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,600
reminding me it has been precisely an

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,820
hour since our last donation so please

14
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,340
if you can find it in your heart to

15
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,680
support us and what we're doing

16
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,899
especially when the beneficiary is the

17
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:51,440
Electronic Frontier Foundation and

18
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,719
mental health hackers it would truly be

19
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:55,680
appreciated

20
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,660
so Misbah a legend a huge outspoken

21
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,870
advocate on twitter what what was your

22
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,020
view of 2019 was it a good year was it a

23
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:18,659
not-so-great here you know I think we've

24
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:21,570
had better years but we've had worse

25
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,299
years - right ok from a security

26
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,170
perspective I think that we saw some

27
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,729
pretty big breaches but like it's just a

28
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:34,740
trend now that we just keep seeing giant

29
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,930
breaches and they're not really a

30
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,520
surprise anymore so you know we have a

31
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,409
lot going on politically here in the

32
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:47,759
United States that made it a challenging

33
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,790
easier time getting here yeah and and as

34
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:56,299
you know or maybe you don't I was fed

35
00:01:56,299 --> 00:01:58,350
working for the federal government the

36
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,500
u.s. federal government until the end of

37
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,439
April this year so this year saw me make

38
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:08,280
the move to the private sector so that

39
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,640
was huge and I I see it as a huge

40
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,590
positive for me for

41
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,379
nineteen I also hope so it was a giant

42
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:18,660
injection into your bank account because

43
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,120
I do know that the federal government

44
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,160
isn't known for affluence amount of

45
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,050
compensation that it that is true

46
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:33,410
however I am sort of a a believer that

47
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:37,440
that security folks and technical folks

48
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,200
and engineers in general should do you

49
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,019
know a stint in the federal space at

50
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:46,019
least two years to to really be able to

51
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:48,450
understand the challenges because it's

52
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,890
easy to complain about all the things

53
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,360
that the government is doing wrong what

54
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,090
sector until you're really embedded in

55
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,940
it and want to to effect positive change

56
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,769
and find that you're completely unable

57
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:01,530
to it's kind of hard to to really grasp

58
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:06,450
that monumental challenge so yes the

59
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,519
feds do not pay as well as the private

60
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:10,980
sector however there are some agencies

61
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,150
that have implemented special hiring

62
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,090
authority to bring folks in it at higher

63
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:21,180
pay levels than the normally tech folks

64
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,810
would come in on so you know yeah you

65
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,019
know the benefits are nice sure you know

66
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:29,670
and actually that's that's a huge

67
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,889
problem that maybe you could comment a

68
00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:34,500
little bit on because I know here at

69
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,889
least in the UK what they pay police

70
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:40,790
officers and specialized cybercrime

71
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:45,239
folks is appalling in comparison to the

72
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,639
private sector and in fact one of the

73
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:50,609
largest criticisms of the lack of police

74
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:53,370
capability in the UK has been those

75
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,849
appalling wages I'm delighted to hear

76
00:03:56,849 --> 00:03:59,970
that there's more parity but I mean

77
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,400
having come from federal service there's

78
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,989
some fairly draconian personal security

79
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:09,690
requirements as in you can't have been

80
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,780
busted for something as innocuous as

81
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:20,599
marijuana correct mmm well so the arrest

82
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:24,090
arrest is not so much now its conviction

83
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,389
okay and some

84
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:31,349
of the rules have changed in regards to

85
00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:33,389
marijuana only because the United States

86
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:36,659
spoken is you you know 50 state states

87
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:39,569
they have made decisions individually

88
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:44,520
about marijuana so while the feds it's

89
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,780
not legalized federally there's an

90
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,270
awareness that folks who live in states

91
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,849
where it is legal are not breaking the

92
00:04:53,849 --> 00:04:57,000
law in their own states so some

93
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,550
positions not so much with the the

94
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,550
larger law enforcement three-letter

95
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:05,669
agencies yeah yeah but but they've made

96
00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:10,409
exceptions or they just remove the the

97
00:05:10,409 --> 00:05:14,669
drug testing regime component part of it

98
00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:17,819
from the job descriptions yeah so but no

99
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:23,009
but it's still we're not there yet so in

100
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:25,319
your transition from federal which is

101
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:28,349
pretty hierarchical very I would say

102
00:05:28,349 --> 00:05:30,719
process procedure driven and of course

103
00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:33,500
approvals at all sorts of crazy levels

104
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,979
and you now suddenly find yourselves in

105
00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:41,339
more of a freewheeling kind of I'm not

106
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:43,650
gonna say anything goes but obviously

107
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:46,469
that the rigidity of the federal

108
00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:49,289
government hasn't really bleeded over

109
00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:51,659
into the civilian world that you're

110
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:53,550
living it did you have a bit of a

111
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,879
transition challenge with maybe being a

112
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:59,819
little bit to sort of like waiting for

113
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:03,389
the permission to do stuff for sure

114
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:08,580
that's an issue we we call that it's

115
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,389
sort of a stagnant thing that happens in

116
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:14,789
in the federal and in the state space

117
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:16,889
and I'm sure it's probably for local too

118
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:18,810
but I can't speak to that

119
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:22,469
but there is definitely a thing that

120
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:25,050
happens in in the government and civil

121
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,150
service space that if you know how to do

122
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,849
something you change your hat and you go

123
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:31,650
do that thing and then they lose a

124
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:33,300
person in another department and you

125
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,750
change your hat you do that thing and so

126
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,330
there's a real danger in

127
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,460
becoming sort of a jack of all trades

128
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,699
master of none okay and that coupled

129
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:51,569
with legacy systems and the the number

130
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:52,500
of hoops

131
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,629
so many hoops that you have to jump

132
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:56,400
through to try to modernize any

133
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,800
technology so you're stuck in this

134
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,090
legacy space that really keeps you from

135
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,659
learning and growing so one of the

136
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:09,840
biggest fears that that a lot of my

137
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,500
technical friends and colleagues have

138
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,110
had moving from the public to the

139
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,909
private sector is that they just are

140
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:19,919
worried that they're not caught up they

141
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:25,949
don't know what they're doing and so I

142
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:31,979
certainly the first 60 days I had you

143
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:34,289
know had those moments where oh I'm the

144
00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:36,210
director of security engineering why am

145
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,039
i waiting for somebody to give me

146
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:40,620
permission to do this or more so have

147
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,440
like the founders of my company I work

148
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,680
for it uh it's called truss based out of

149
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,229
San Francisco but to have the founders

150
00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:51,719
say we hired you as the director like do

151
00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:53,340
what you think is the right thing and

152
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,830
that was I was a director of

153
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,389
infrastructure engineering in the

154
00:07:57,389 --> 00:07:59,930
federal space and didn't have that

155
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:04,069
authority yes the ability to execute

156
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:09,229
correct so it's definitely culture shock

157
00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:11,690
but in a good way because obviously

158
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:14,310
you're especially I get the impression

159
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,979
especially from Twitter you like to get

160
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:18,419
things done you like to accomplish

161
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:22,139
things you like to effect change so this

162
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:25,020
is now your your rise if you will in

163
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,669
order to really drive agendas forward

164
00:08:28,669 --> 00:08:33,419
yes and the beauty of working where I

165
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:37,909
work now is that we do in fact have

166
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:39,500
[Music]

167
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:44,490
federal clients so the relationships as

168
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:48,180
well yeah right so but I'm actually the

169
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:52,740
like they'll listen to us as their

170
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,080
contractors in a way that they didn't

171
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,890
listen or couldn't make changes when I

172
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:02,790
was embedded internally in that space so

173
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:07,980
I'm actually like helping on projects

174
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,740
that I used to actually like work on as

175
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,380
a Fed and couldn't get any traction and

176
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:20,820
now can like direct the security path

177
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,220
that we take and architect the systems

178
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,700
and then deliver those systems so it's

179
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,570
it's really fascinating just to change

180
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,089
that's the job change in how you're

181
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:36,120
perceived yeah but like definitely pour

182
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,850
one out for my fed homies we're still in

183
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,560
there trying to get something cuz it's

184
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,010
hard

185
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,930
we've never done you're gonna hire all

186
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:49,830
of them I Erik Burgess so my my

187
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:54,240
colleague who runs NOLA Khan yeah Mike

188
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,279
you got a question yeah quick question

189
00:09:56,279 --> 00:10:00,660
for you miss bat miss bat in your

190
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,579
Twitter profile you've got no as a

191
00:10:02,579 --> 00:10:10,890
service but would you mind explaining it

192
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,950
yes sir I actually put that on my work

193
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:19,680
profile to you um so it's it's a bit

194
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,690
snarky right but yeah I say no a lot can

195
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,899
we integrate this application no can we

196
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:32,880
use this plugin no can we run this

197
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,890
instance no and it's turned into a I

198
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:41,190
don't know it's it's more of a

199
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:44,130
methodology I've found like okay

200
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:46,020
insurance companies do it here and it's

201
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:50,070
very it's shitty but they will decline

202
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,660
something the first time it comes

203
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,790
through right or say no and then you

204
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,640
submit an appeal and then they

205
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,290
reconsider it and then they consider it

206
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,230
actually so I think that a lot of

207
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,360
changes that are made and infrastructure

208
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,990
are just made by people who come in and

209
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,610
always done it that way so they want to

210
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:10,850
keep doing it that way and then what you

211
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:14,589
end up with is three or four different

212
00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:18,320
CI tools in your infrastructure or five

213
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,510
different tracking systems in your

214
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,250
infrastructure or whatever the thing is

215
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:26,990
right so it's it's it's like a joke but

216
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:30,320
but not really because I've you know if

217
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,149
I say no the first time around that

218
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:37,399
means that I need you to come back to me

219
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:40,010
with a real reason why I need to

220
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:42,589
introduce this into our infrastructure

221
00:11:42,589 --> 00:11:46,240
and and do that by coming to me to say

222
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,760
we've we have this tool but it doesn't

223
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,470
do this type of deployment or it's not

224
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,690
you know it doesn't meet the needs for

225
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:59,060
this particular part of our lifecycle

226
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,480
and I don't know did I answer your

227
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,490
question yeah I think you did and I

228
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,740
think ultimately we don't we don't as

229
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:10,310
people say no enough if they yes too

230
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:15,890
often so I have a kind of follow on from

231
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:18,680
that so if we look at businesses today

232
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,020
there's a push to move things faster

233
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:24,470
deploy faster to play more do you think

234
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,680
that has an impact on us same though

235
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,480
where we often pressure just to say yes

236
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,520
just to get out the door and look better

237
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:39,140
yeah and but I don't completely hate the

238
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:43,190
idea of just diving in hard and fast and

239
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:47,360
doing the thing in delivery I think that

240
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,820
I think both ways of approaching a

241
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,190
problem can be valid right the

242
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:58,640
meticulous research oriented cautious

243
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,360
approach to delivery there's a place for

244
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,980
that but there's also a place for

245
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:10,550
innovation and experimentation and you

246
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:13,670
know you might fail and I think people

247
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:16,329
are so afraid of failing that they stop

248
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,780
experimenting and stop trying new things

249
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:23,520
great um but you know history is made by

250
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,790
people who take chances so you know I

251
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:32,400
think it depends would be my answer so I

252
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,590
want to talk a little bit about the

253
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:38,700
future for you in 2020 I mean you're a

254
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,160
huge force I think in the community

255
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,620
you're very open about when you're

256
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,330
having a good day and when you're not

257
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:48,960
having a good day are you gonna continue

258
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,050
sort of as a community advocate or are

259
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,840
you finding that your new

260
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,400
responsibilities with private sector are

261
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,790
sort of impacting the time that you have

262
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:03,320
to spend there in that in that place

263
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,510
that's that's a good question first and

264
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:09,870
foremost I'll say that the folks that I

265
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:12,990
work for are a hundred percent

266
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:18,540
supportive of you know just me being me

267
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,510
so that's amazing and we encourage

268
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:27,750
individuality at trusts and so you know

269
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,600
what to share what not to share you're

270
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,450
right I'll share if I'm having a bad day

271
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:39,720
I will not ever throw a colleague or a

272
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,350
client under the bus even vaguely by sub

273
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,250
tweeted about it

274
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,430
so for sure my twitter is definitely

275
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:52,620
more like personal I guess but I think

276
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:56,850
it's important because it's it's just

277
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:59,940
reality I think that people who curate

278
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,420
their lives on social media to look like

279
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:07,140
this super perfect thing are really

280
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,720
doing a disservice to folks who do

281
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,000
struggle with things like social anxiety

282
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,060
or depression or mental health issues

283
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,490
because you're painting an unrealistic

284
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:20,100
picture of what your life is really like

285
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:24,000
so I think it's okay to say like this

286
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,209
sucks or I got out of bed today and so

287
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:28,970
let's just call that a win or

288
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,650
to say like I couldn't get out of bed

289
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:36,080
today um and and it's just I don't know

290
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:41,210
I really don't like

291
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:44,630
I mean people I certainly wouldn't want

292
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:47,900
to carry anyone else's social media life

293
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,120
and people are free to live their best

294
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,930
life I just I'm not the kind of person

295
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:57,230
who is gonna pretend that living my best

296
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:59,030
life means that every day is a perfect

297
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:02,120
day yeah it's just disingenuous I

298
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,180
actually do you feel like do you

299
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,400
consider yourself out of a role model

300
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,730
somebody that you know a lot of people

301
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,500
in the community look up to you or do

302
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,450
you just sort of consider yourself kind

303
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,760
of a regular person or regular you know

304
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,100
that just happens to have a giant

305
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,010
following of people and so how do you

306
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:24,200
sort of balance that in in sort of your

307
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:24,650
mind

308
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,970
hey so no I don't think I don't think of

309
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:32,030
myself as a role model but I am acutely

310
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:35,750
aware of the number of folks from

311
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:39,530
different different backgrounds and

312
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:47,180
experiences who follow me and I do my

313
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:51,530
best to provide like to try to be

314
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:54,980
positive yeah folks even when even when

315
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:59,270
I don't really have much to make sure

316
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:02,870
sure because I there folks who have it

317
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:06,349
worse than I do for sure I I don't think

318
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:09,949
it's cool to to drag people on Twitter

319
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:13,250
it's like I I you know certainly call

320
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,140
out predators but you know just in

321
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:19,010
general like people just being douches

322
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:21,170
because they think it's funny or edgy or

323
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:24,650
whatever that's just not really Who I am

324
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,720
but you've been you've been in the

325
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,850
community for quite a time and I've

326
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,380
asked his questions for some of the

327
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,000
people that have been there almost from

328
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,700
the beginning do you see it getting

329
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,460
better do you see it getting worse

330
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,929
some folks have sort of said yeah it

331
00:17:38,929 --> 00:17:41,600
seems to be policing itself behaviors

332
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,200
being

333
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,559
more often other folks have had sort of

334
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:50,929
a more of a contrary view where are you

335
00:17:50,929 --> 00:17:54,019
sitting on it is this industry maturing

336
00:17:54,019 --> 00:17:57,799
or are we descending into chaos well I

337
00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:04,120
would certainly hope that we're maturing

338
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:12,500
you know you can't fix 30 years of bad

339
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,779
behavior with the fad behavior or

340
00:18:14,779 --> 00:18:18,260
internalize the misogyny or you know

341
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,149
we'll use the word patriarchy right like

342
00:18:20,149 --> 00:18:23,149
that have been very very male driven um

343
00:18:23,149 --> 00:18:28,399
and it's gonna take some time for that

344
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:32,360
culture shift to happen I think that

345
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,820
it's unrealistic to think it could

346
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:40,100
happen quickly if the diversity pipeline

347
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,889
were that easy to just snap our fingers

348
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:45,500
fix and then all of a sudden it's like

349
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:49,279
you know kumbaya and everyone's happy

350
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:51,950
and everything's copacetic like we would

351
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:54,710
we would have done that right but these

352
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:59,809
these changes now where companies

353
00:18:59,809 --> 00:19:04,429
recognize the importance of having a

354
00:19:04,429 --> 00:19:07,610
diverse team understand the importance

355
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:12,350
of dismissing creditors for the

356
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:17,809
community to recognize that just because

357
00:19:17,809 --> 00:19:19,789
someone's a contributor to the community

358
00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:22,429
doesn't mean that's you know carte

359
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:27,350
blanche to behave inappropriately toward

360
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:31,429
other members of the community based on

361
00:19:31,429 --> 00:19:37,600
you know any of the gender religion race

362
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:43,880
like identity you know it's it I would

363
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,850
like to think that the tides are turning

364
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:50,779
only because when I go to conferences

365
00:19:50,779 --> 00:19:55,010
now I'm not the only woman

366
00:19:55,010 --> 00:20:00,800
and so for me that seems like when the

367
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,760
company I work for is 50 percent not

368
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,340
folks who identify as male I think

369
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:12,140
that's that's incredible so you know I

370
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,770
think change starts at home and and it's

371
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:17,630
gonna take a little while to turn this

372
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:21,950
around but I think knowing that we need

373
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,960
to turn it around means that we're

374
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,630
headed in a better direction that's

375
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:29,030
great that's just really positive so

376
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:31,820
we're winding down I think on the time

377
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,220
that we have what sort of advice do you

378
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:38,630
have to folks that are you know thinking

379
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,550
about starting into this career or maybe

380
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:43,760
even more appropriately coming from

381
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,060
federal or military service and thinking

382
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,560
about going into the private sector

383
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,450
because I think that's a great

384
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,610
experience that you've recently had that

385
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:56,140
you can talk about sure I think that

386
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:59,300
first I would say you know a good job

387
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,750
for for starving any time as a civil

388
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:06,830
servant and and I would just say maybe

389
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:10,100
don't worry so much about what what you

390
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:14,300
think you don't know there's always a

391
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:18,260
need and the folks who are out there in

392
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,750
the private sector hiring former civil

393
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,850
servants or you know hiring folks out of

394
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:25,820
civil service they know they already

395
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,830
know they know that you've been working

396
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:30,380
on legacy systems they know that the

397
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:33,100
processes are messed up they know that

398
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:37,070
you're used to reporting up you know to

399
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:41,990
a five or six supervisory chain to get a

400
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:46,520
simple change done so it's the

401
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,650
resilience is what they're looking for

402
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:52,880
and if you serve in you know two years

403
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,220
or more in civil service like you're

404
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,500
resilient and so I think potential

405
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,110
employers will recognize that I'm also

406
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:03,350
going to plug my workshop you can go to

407
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:08,480
stab ops calm and you'll see a link to

408
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,940
the framework for my mock interview and

409
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,070
resume review were the top it hub but

410
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,869
there's also Heroku app if you just want

411
00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:17,419
to look at the documents without looking

412
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:20,179
at github but there are a lot of tips in

413
00:22:20,179 --> 00:22:22,669
there for folks who are trying to

414
00:22:22,669 --> 00:22:25,519
transition or look for other jobs right

415
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:28,340
down to culture fit questions sample

416
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:32,539
technical questions resources so it's

417
00:22:32,539 --> 00:22:35,989
out there it's free and if the goal is

418
00:22:35,989 --> 00:22:38,509
for people running their own conferences

419
00:22:38,509 --> 00:22:41,690
to take that framework and and set up a

420
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,639
mentorship thing with the frame work out

421
00:22:43,639 --> 00:22:46,669
your own conference so you gets a huge

422
00:22:46,669 --> 00:22:49,009
contribution and a huge resource which

423
00:22:49,009 --> 00:22:52,549
has just been I think really impactful

424
00:22:52,549 --> 00:22:55,519
and we absolutely thank you and kind of

425
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:58,220

428
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:04,489
I think we're gonna wrap you up at that

429
00:23:04,489 --> 00:23:06,529
point because we're gonna be we've no

430
00:23:06,529 --> 00:23:10,519

431
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:14,179
got Amanda Amanda Berlin next say she's

432
00:23:14,179 --> 00:23:18,980
a 20 hour road trip ten hours at

433
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,470
Maryland spent a day than ten hours back

434
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:25,309
last weekend to deliver a hat to its

435
00:23:25,309 --> 00:23:28,759
rightful home so you should ask her

436
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:30,649
about how many cats she's delivered

437
00:23:30,649 --> 00:23:33,559
