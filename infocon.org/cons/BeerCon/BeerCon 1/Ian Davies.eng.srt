00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:05,040
you in 2019 so yeah I was voted myself

20
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,900
is the oldest new guy in empo SEC okay

21
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:13,260
I'm in my I'm in my mid 50s and I have

22
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,900
worked in IT since 1980 something I

23
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,250
worked on my first computer when I was

24
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,220
in the Royal Air Force the thing was the

25
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,930
size of my house and the changes that

26
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,920
we've seen over my lifetime with being

27
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,140
phenomenal so I I started my IT career a

28
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,090
pretty much straight from school I

29
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,470
joined the RAF and and ended up in 1987

30
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,649
ended up on a site that ran I was

31
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:48,960
described as the the predecessor to

32
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,549
email it was a right it was a

33
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:54,930
telegraphic thing but it was all done

34
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,240
from green screen videos with this big

35
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,899
mainframe and the in a separate just we

36
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:03,930
found was that you was at the beginnings

37
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,020
of our debt we

38
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,899
the Americans had sort of built it and

39
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,440
then eventually the UK it expanded to

40
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,080
the UK or was this just a internal UK

41
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,269
communication system this was an

42
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:19,890
internal UK

43
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,239
okay so it was called the defense

44
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:25,500
communications network okay and and the

45
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,690
two product that out the two products

46
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:28,769
that I worked on they were called

47
00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:30,480
Telegraph automatic routing equipment

48
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,420
and telegraph automatic switching system

49
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:38,370
and and originally they weren't they

50
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,269
weren't electronic we started to bring

51
00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:44,880
teleprinters and punched paper tape and

52
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,769
then we moved it green screen video use

53
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:51,060
and we still printed everything out on

54
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,060
paper so although it came out to the

55
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,099
operators I'm going to be video use we

56
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:58,319
would they would still print it out and

57
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,810
the actual messages would be delivered

58
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,410
to people in classified folders but they

59
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,780
would still be printed out on on bits of

60
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,459
paper on a teleprinter in the corner

61
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:13,440
somewhere and that was my introduction

62
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,109
into IT and I've from there done various

63
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:23,690
jobs within that field I've worked in

64
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:26,790
SME worked in a very small business I've

65
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,670
worked in education they've worked in a

66
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,410
public sector of what's in a private

67
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:36,319
sector and and currently I work for

68
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,120
builders merchants Greek ok across

69
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,660
Europe I mean so so you evolved from IT

70
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,510
at you know basically military

71
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,480
classified communication systems and

72
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,109
then into the wider sort of IT what it

73
00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:55,910
was was the move towards security a

74
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:00,829
natural one or self-inflicted it was um

75
00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:06,000
so I hadn't realized this until very

76
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,819
recently but even as young as a teenager

77
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:13,290
I used to I used to do a lot of hardware

78
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,150
hacking I used to take things apart to

79
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,370
see how they worked or to see what I

80
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,700
could do with them or to still a part

81
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,850
I'll make something else and I used to

82
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:27,540
go down we used to have a place just

83
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,200
down the road that made TV aerials and

84
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,610
in the days that you had an aerial on

85
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,230
your roof or your TV instead of a dish

86
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,600
and then down there in beg borrow and

87
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,600
steal aluminium offcuts so I could make

88
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,510
my own aerials for the radios that had

89
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:45,270
built or for my CB radio which was

90
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,550
completely illegal and hidden under my

91
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,630
bed so that nobody knew I got it but

92
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,590
Minh

93
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:56,870
I think it was inevitable eventually I

94
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:01,110
went and did see eh about 18 months ago

95
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,500
I went and did see a tan and I opened my

96
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,960
eyes really two whole bunch of stuff I

97
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,120
just didn't know I didn't know about

98
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,660
them

99
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:14,490
I mean spent 30 years in IT that 30

100
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,130
years delivering infrastructure there

101
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,470
was a whole bunch of stuff that nobody

102
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:22,850
had ever explained to me or shown me or

103
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:26,910
you know I I knew nothing about Carly

104
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,890
and you know think about Metasploit or

105
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:32,520
all of this stuff that we talk about on

106
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,830
a daily basis from penetration testing

107
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:38,250
and kind of actively exploiting

108
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,250
vulnerabilities nobody had ever i was

109
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,460
completely oblivious to all and so were

110
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,840
the people around me when i'm quite hard

111
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,460
on myself to think now thinking there

112
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,050
which especially when i believe did some

113
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,480
other mistakes I made in the past but

114
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,210
but but all of the people that were

115
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:59,220
around me all of the MSBs that I worked

116
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,260
with the more senior people that I

117
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,840
worked with in my younger days none of

118
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,830
us were really had any knowledge of some

119
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,530
of the stuff that goes on yeah and some

120
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:14,070
of the possibilities so was it like

121
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:16,890
falling down they you know the Alice in

122
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:20,190
Wonderland moment or was it just like a

123
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,980
passion that got stirred up in you that

124
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,440
you wanted to know more you wanted to

125
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,590
see the knowledge yeah it was definitely

126
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:31,310
latter and when I came back from so I

127
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,320
did my

128
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,590
I did the course with with a company in

129
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:41,960
Dublin and and I came back from that

130
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,460
eight days

131
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:47,290
I came back from that eight days just

132
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:51,170
absolutely begging for more for more

133
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,060
knowledge and more information and to

134
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:57,560
learn more and to do more in my mid-50s

135
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,570
for the first time in ages it was

136
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:02,390
actually really really interesting and

137
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:05,000
building labs again and doing the

138
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,190
technical stuff that I'd love to do when

139
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:12,890
I was much younger and that enthusiasm

140
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,280
spilled over or must've spilled over I

141
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:20,030
was invited by the the company that I

142
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,470
currently work for it didn't have a

143
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:24,890
security team they had one information

144
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:27,830
security manager mostly doing governance

145
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:31,480
and policy and they wanted to build a

146
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:36,230
more proactive more technical security

147
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:41,810
team and right.we they appointed a new

148
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:45,500
security manager and my enthusiam my

149
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,300
enthusiasm for it must have spilled over

150
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,090
because he came to me and said I would

151
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,860
really like you to come and join me and

152
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,540
if you come and join me and do this this

153
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,390
is my vision for the next two three four

154
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,880
or five years brilliant we can do this

155
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,030
together and so I gave up what I was

156
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,820
doing and went and worked with him and

157
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,620
I've been doing that now for about 12

158
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,780
months which is this is what I would say

159
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,730
I'm the oldest new guy in fo sec did

160
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:14,120
really great for 12 months but you bring

161
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,030
all of this infrastructure experiences

162
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:20,450
not to mention a lot of contacts like

163
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:23,900
you you mentioned how important was your

164
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,510
network of people or the people that you

165
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,970
know in sort of like helping you along

166
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:31,580
this journey or was it really you felt

167
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,190
you didn't have a lot of people you

168
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:39,860
could go to quite difficult when I first

169
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,590
came back from Dublin having done that

170
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:46,340
that c8 qualification I was really

171
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,840
really excited I

172
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,130
I've found a new passion for four tack a

173
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:56,750
whole new set of stuff that a 55 I

174
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:00,470
thought you know was I didn't expect to

175
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:03,650
be that excited about IT remember again

176
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:09,230
and I found that I found big portions of

177
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:12,080
the community at that time and I'll

178
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,140
qualify that because it's not reflective

179
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:18,140
of where we are today but when I first

180
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,950
started trying to reach out to people to

181
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:24,890
get started to find more information I I

182
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:28,130
was I found quite a negative approach to

183
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:30,650
it mostly because of the qualification

184
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:33,020
that I just a missed I want to live more

185
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,600
will you help where can I get more

186
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,250
information what can I do how come a

187
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:40,760
little more about this and and I did run

188
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,970
across quite a lot of gatekeeping and

189
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:47,450
and snobbery is the in who think that I

190
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:50,060
could describe it yes oh yeah you know

191
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,320
nothing you've already done that you

192
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,870
need to go and do osep you need to go

193
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,870
and do more on your own that nobody will

194
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,640
teach you about security you have to go

195
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,750
and learn it on your own you know you

196
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,500
have to try harder and that was I was

197
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,080
quite surprised at that I have to say

198
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,360
that I on Twitter particularly now I

199
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,610
find that I'm linked up with a whole

200
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:16,220
bunch of people a lot of them are

201
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,740
involved in this today and in fact I

202
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,150
think they're all involved in this today

203
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:24,890
but yeah and it's not that that was a

204
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,290
bad experience but it's not the true

205
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:30,910
experience I don't think of Infotech and

206
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:34,370
sometimes you find it's the ones with a

207
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,910
big following or the live voice that

208
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:41,780
that sometimes are there they doing the

209
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,460
gatekeeping but if you can get past that

210
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,920
and find those you know we spoke to Dan

211
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,280
early don't we we were talking about Dan

212
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,880
earlier he's been a fantastic help and

213
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,500
continues to be to all of us in this

214
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,500
community as to you and Mary can thank

215
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,570
you and Sean and Andy

216
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:03,880
particularly his outside of beer farmers

217
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,260
and besides and other things there's

218
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,640
some other projects that I've worked on

219
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,570
Mondays he's offered help and that

220
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:14,170
that's fairly unique I thinking in

221
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:17,050
InfoSec you don't see that much in an IT

222
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,330
I mean we were we would all talk about

223
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,370
tech but we wouldn't necessarily go and

224
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:24,400
help each other or put ourselves out to

225
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,140
lab stuff out and say well I did it this

226
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,330
way and it worked for me you share

227
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:34,390
results all right so so in a way it did

228
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:38,680
kind of come full circle good oh that's

229
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,110
good that's really good because you know

230
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,960
it's vital that and great that you

231
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:48,310
persevered I worry that you know folks

232
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:52,690
wouldn't be as as driven and that we

233
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:56,740
would and that we end up losing folks on

234
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:00,630
that journey without a necessary support

235
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:04,300
are you are you active in the community

236
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,420
now and going to conferences and and

237
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,670
putting in for call for papers and stuff

238
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:14,920
so I I did two rookie talks this year

239
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,430
and I've been to four community

240
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:21,910
conferences so I did I did besides in

241
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,490
London Liverpool and Manchester I went

242
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:28,000
to steel con as I said my guest of one

243
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,630
of the vendors at one of the promoters

244
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:36,340
and I plan to do the same next year I'm

245
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,800
hoping to volunteer at one or two of

246
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,210
them next year to get a different

247
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,940
perspective of how they run on what they

248
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:47,680
do and I enjoy public speaking I hadn't

249
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,450
realized how much they enjoyed it and

250
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:53,050
there's a little anecdote that I'll

251
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,510
share about doing that in it and they if

252
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:58,060
I get a chance before we finish because

253
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:01,470
I think it's important but go for it I

254
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:04,980
know so it wasn't public speaking but I

255
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,510
got the opportunity to spend an hour

256
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:10,450
with a bunch of people at work who

257
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:14,560
didn't really want to be there okay

258
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,450
I know it's all cat head office in

259
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:20,170
Dublin they were it was for some very

260
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:22,060
senior people that weren't quite c-suite

261
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,450
but they were very close they commented

262
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:26,830
that this had been really informative

263
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,510
and really good and they really enjoyed

264
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,790
it and actually the hour that I'd given

265
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,650
ran into two hours because they kept

266
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:34,030
asking questions and kept asking

267
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,530
questions it kept asking questions

268
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:37,930
that's a good time it was a very good

269
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,700
time and it was very very positive and I

270
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,730
came back to the UK and I was asked by

271
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:46,270
the UK people so I was c-suite really

272
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,220
now based in the UK and I was asked by

273
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:52,330
the UK team to repeat that that session

274
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:56,680
in the UK and we did that and then they

275
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,480
just had to on me to request same time

276
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,000
security training it's mandatory you

277
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,640
must attend and all of these people came

278
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,390
from HR and from finance and there were

279
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:10,060
no IT people there we were aiming it at

280
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:14,260
people who weren't within the IT arena

281
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,290
at that point right and we delivered

282
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,990
this training and and I I had to leave

283
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:22,300
pretty much as soon as I delivered it we

284
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,220
delivered this session we just talked

285
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,070
about password security we talked about

286
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:30,070
in not over sharing on Facebook all of

287
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,690
the kind of common things we talked

288
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:36,400
about and frequently within with a NATO

289
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,180
OPSEC operational security it's not

290
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,900
really a term I like much but I didn't

291
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,280
get any feedback from that session at

292
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,350
all a few people said that they went

293
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,820
back and they were kind of checking have

294
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,370
I been poned to see if they email

295
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,830
addresses were listed they were talking

296
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,330
about the training they were telling

297
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:57,130
people who didn't come what they missed

298
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,980
which was quite good and then I was out

299
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,230
at the works Christmas dinner on Friday

300
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:04,690
and this lady came up to me and she sat

301
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,790
down next to me after we'd all eaten and

302
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:09,880
said I just wanted to tell you that the

303
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,890
meeting you did on cybersecurity was the

304
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:14,290
best meeting I've ever been to ever in

305
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:17,830
Oh madam that's wonderful I went home

306
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,890
and I was up to I was sweating and

307
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,150
shaking in the meeting because I

308
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,550
realized that everything I did was wrong

309
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,529
and I went home and I was up to one

310
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:28,269
o'clock with my husband changing all our

311
00:15:28,269 --> 00:15:30,310
passwords and getting a password manager

312
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,500
and going on Facebook and locking

313
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,310
Facebook down you know that that's one

314
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:40,180
win right but it it's a huge one it's

315
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,579
it's a big win because she's now telling

316
00:15:42,579 --> 00:15:44,320
everybody else about that she was the

317
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,450
Train know in the HR director and the IT

318
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:49,329
director and all of her friends are now

319
00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:51,250
getting that information from her and

320
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,459
not from me and I don't think I'd

321
00:15:54,459 --> 00:15:58,570
realized quite how I don't think I was

322
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:02,019
ready for InfoSec being so people

323
00:16:02,019 --> 00:16:03,970
oriented I thought it was tech oriented

324
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:09,310
yeah and it's not really we we need to

325
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:12,130
work with people we we're very good at

326
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:14,260
working with that but we need to get

327
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,209
better and work with people and we need

328
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:18,820
to aim it out of people who can make a

329
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,649
difference and they're the ones who

330
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:23,410
aren't technical they're very astute

331
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:26,260
observation and if you want a classic

332
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:30,220
example of how to change security

333
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:33,850
culture in an organization you my friend

334
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,190
figured that out

335
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:39,220
by making an ally that will then you

336
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,209
know go forward and sing your praises I

337
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:45,130
take a solace in that

338
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,380
because victories as you probably are

339
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:51,820
aware are sometimes elusive in his

340
00:16:51,820 --> 00:17:00,520
profession was slightly embarrassed by

341
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:05,349
the by the praise and they because she

342
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:07,750
just you know she was full of it but um

343
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,569
it was it was a little embarrassing and

344
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:14,410
but it wins don't come very often and

345
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:17,230
you certainly we work in IT ultimately

346
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:19,569
and you already know you doing a good

347
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:22,569
job and I see when nobody complains yeah

348
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:25,809
yeah yeah that's exactly and you know

349
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:28,030
I've written on that subject where you

350
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:31,570
get into situation where you get a very

351
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,850
negative outlook because you know it's

352
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:37,250
constant war and it's it's constant

353
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,830
like going against the bad guys anyways

354
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,860
we're almost done with you my friend

355
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,380
really insightful and very interesting

356
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:49,700
any words of advice to somebody sort of

357
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,920
your age that wants to make the

358
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,500
transition into cybersecurity what

359
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,500
advice would you give them you've got to

360
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,770
be persistent I mean somebody posted on

361
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:03,560
one today you've got to have attitude

362
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,440
and aptitude you've got to be persistent

363
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,720
you've got to want it and you're going

364
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,570
to be prepared to work you know work

365
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,130
hard because you've got to do your job

366
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:16,460
and go and learn this yeah and I'm

367
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,990
finding the learning harder and harder

368
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:20,360
as I get older and older to be fair here

369
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,150
yeah but there are people out there just

370
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:27,200
very very quickly I I not so much at my

371
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,410
age but I the people in every sec I

372
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:33,410
would say stop measuring yourself

373
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,300
against other people and stop worrying

374
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,730
about where you are in your career and

375
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:40,850
there was there was a lady I follow on

376
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:43,250
Twitter who was really put out she was

377
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,750
measuring ourselves she wasn't sure she

378
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,940
was in the right place but when I

379
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,910
started an IT I'm written down here

380
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,530
because I had to go and research it when

381
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:54,890
I started in IT Pythian didn't exist

382
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:57,920
PowerShell didn't exist C++ was less

383
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,960
than a year old c-sharp hadn't been

384
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,800
invented and yeah none of us could I

385
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,290
couldn't possibly know that I was going

386
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:08,210
to end up in information security when I

387
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:11,930
left school and started work and it

388
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,970
doesn't matter where you are now but it

389
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:16,010
matters that you do a good job of what

390
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:21,880
you're doing and just work hard and

391
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,440
don't keep measuring yourself against

392
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,410
other people to do you be you and do a

393
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:29,360
good job great advice
