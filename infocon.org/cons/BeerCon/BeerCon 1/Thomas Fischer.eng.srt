7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,250
benefit of people that don't know who

8
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,320
you are would you mind just giving us a

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,150
little intro is to inter who you are

10
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,119
what what sort of stuff you get up to

11
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:29,160
that's a complicated one so let's do it

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,949
it's to I do so I mean most people know

13
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,719
me right now because I'm one of the

14
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,270
directors would be sighs London and I

15
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,250
also participate heavily in conferences

16
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,129
as as a speaker and as and I was just

17
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:42,719
participant I'd like to share knowledge

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,350
and I like to to help people get into

19
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,670
learning new things and getting getting

20
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,700
into the industry outside of that I

21
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,340
probably should say that anything I say

22
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,750
is my personal opinion and doesn't

23
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,440
reflect anything you know employee type

24
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,270
employers situations past present or

25
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:00,690
future

26
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,010
but yeah I heard that you gotta be

27
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,600
careful with those things but

28
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,369
essentially what I do I've I've been in

29
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:10,590
many parts of our industry you know I

30
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,240
started as a developer but then I went

31
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,250
into in for sake well we can actaully

32
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,560
for say well we now actually we used to

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,490
call in for sake now we call it

34
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,979
cybersecurity I don't care it's just you

35
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,720
know information security security on

36
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,610
top of IT I started MIT and I grew into

37
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:29,430
security and I've been both insert

38
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,630
responder architect I've done compliance

39
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,659
pass you know and I did my focus has

40
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:40,259
always been on looking at what's the

41
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,990
actual valuable aspects to potentially

42
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:45,030
an attacker whether inside or outside

43
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,420
so in our situation today I mean you

44
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,040
know what we're I to systems managing is

45
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,500
basically at the data right so whether

46
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,680
it's personal data or I intellectual

47
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,020
property or things like that the whole

48
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,290
aspects of for me of doing what I do is

49
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,719
is focused on how do we protect the data

50
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,430
and how do we ensure that the data stays

51
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,020
stays coherent and

52
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:12,080
and untouched by the fighters various

53
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,210
parties I I met you at an ICS conference

54
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,460
as I recall when you were working for a

55
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,760
digital Guardian yeah was it was it deep

56
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,460
separately for all it was that

57
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,440
face-to-face yeah it was deep sense that

58
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,250
we not supposed to make this

59
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,770
face-to-face and I was always struck by

60
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,790
you know a kind of the way you've got

61
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:39,230
pretty I'm gonna say unflexible opinions

62
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:42,680
of the of the industry and I was really

63
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,220
strongly drawn to that we you know so I

64
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,440
think you know out of a lot of our

65
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,260
guests you have some really interesting

66
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,690
perspectives to share with you what do

67
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:58,610
you think we're doing wrong I think part

68
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:01,580
of our problem is a lot of times we're

69
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,250
doing things for ourselves trying to fix

70
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,070
a problem that isn't pretentious we're

71
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,360
trying to fix a problem the way that we

72
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,700
see it not the way that the actual

73
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,830
business might see it all of it and the

74
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:16,490
actual people might see it I'm actually

75
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,280
starting a brand and this is gonna be

76
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,110
one of my talks for next year okay

77
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:24,230
preview for you guys my next talk is

78
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:27,170
actually about stopped user shaming okay

79
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:30,590
around the stop yeah we're always [ __ ]

80
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:34,370
blaming the the user I'm assuming this

81
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,400
isn't a safe work environment so it's

82
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,550
gonna be a carry on so it's like every

83
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,440
[ __ ] time I hear this it's like oh

84
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,330
the user did this usually for that even

85
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,220
if it's a response like that stupid

86
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,540
[ __ ] user you clicked on the thing

87
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,430
again and now we've got a [ __ ] botnet

88
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,650
in our network it's like no it's not the

89
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,510
users fault if the user is doing it it's

90
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:55,700
because we're basically in a situation

91
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,770
that we haven't given them or we haven't

92
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,380
prepared the environment enough for them

93
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,300
to be it to do things in the right way

94
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,750
right if you take a look at yeah

95
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,500
everybody can press it's the car

96
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,760
industry but compared to the car

97
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,130
industry right why is the car industry

98
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:12,530
safer or the airplane industry safer

99
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,110
because there is a wrist as a known risk

100
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,940
right there was Wednesday car started to

101
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,470
appear there was horse-drawn carriages

102
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,350
and cars and people walking and

103
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,540
the cause definitely went faster so

104
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,640
Lord's got introduced right and he got

105
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,190
into a stage where basically they had to

106
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,990
build the cars to make him safe for the

107
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,970
driver because you can't stop stupidity

108
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,010
of the person right because some people

109
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,210
would drive fast because they think they

110
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:36,330
know better and things like that and as

111
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:39,370
much as we try and make those solutions

112
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:43,690
and NIT and InfoSec we're not actually

113
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,300
giving the user a safe environment right

114
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,340
we're just telling them oh don't do this

115
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,340
don't click on this link I mean let's be

116
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,070
fair how many people I'd like to see

117
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,080
some real stats on how good user wins

118
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,180
programs actually work right here not

119
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,760
how good they're actually responding to

120
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,010
your you know once a month phishing test

121
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:07,510
but how much of your incidents related

122
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,730
to a user have actually gone down right

123
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,130
and I'm pretty sure most organizations

124
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:15,070
will not what we'll we'll see that

125
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,450
they're not actually reducing their

126
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,610
incident rate that comes out of an end

127
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,590
user because the way nurse doesn't

128
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,930
awareness isn't really working you know

129
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,460
we call it awareness is it raining is it

130
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,930
awareness is it raining awareness has a

131
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:31,300
specific it's a specific has a specific

132
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,010
meaning right I mean it's not really

133
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,690
training it's not really giving people

134
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,880
what they need to be able to do things

135
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,510
correctly you have to agree so so that's

136
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:43,750
you know and it just that's the kind

137
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,820
when you know like what Ian was

138
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,710
referring to that's that's what pisses

139
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,570
me off because a lot of times we're

140
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:51,190
doing things for ourselves we're not

141
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,810
doing things to actually advance the

142
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,520
industry I mean all of the hackers would

143
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,650
present oh I found this new zero dare

144
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,420
and I found this on a brokenness oh okay

145
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,460
how the [ __ ] do you fix it I don't care

146
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,230
if you broke it give me a [ __ ] way

147
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,390
way to fix it yeah right I'm not a

148
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,190
number CFP boards my first comment is

149
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,080
how do you fix this how is it as a

150
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,360
customer a business owner do I protect

151
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,310
myself against this right yeah you can't

152
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,750
give me that you know why because you're

153
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,220
only interested in breaking the [ __ ]

154
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:18,670
okay and it's like I mean grow up right

155
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,560
we're no longer we're no longer like

156
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,690
back in the nineties where hackers were

157
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,700
it was cool to be you know to be on the

158
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,530
hackers movie or to look to pretend to

159
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:27,790
be like on the hackers movie

160
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,140
we're actually an industry now we're

161
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,760
actually we're actually a professional

162
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,650
we have professional societies you have

163
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:33,039
all this

164
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,930
but yet we still act like [ __ ] kids

165
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,460
yeah it's a good point that's

166
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,189
interesting that you the idea of user

167
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:41,830
blaming is a subject that I I feel very

168
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:45,279
strongly about as the hue clearly and

169
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:48,039
really be we blame the individuals who

170
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:50,559
we really need on side and that does

171
00:06:50,559 --> 00:06:52,419
really worry it's all about it's part

172
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:53,740
and parcel of your arsenal to have

173
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,569
people doing the right things but I

174
00:06:55,569 --> 00:06:57,399
always think that if something does go

175
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:59,259
south within an organization it's

176
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:01,539
probably a control that fails rather

177
00:07:01,539 --> 00:07:05,309
than the person I agree

178
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:08,349
yeah I agree go ahead there's this one

179
00:07:08,349 --> 00:07:10,149
incident though that it happened

180
00:07:10,149 --> 00:07:13,240
recently that I just found hysterical

181
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,339
and it sort of underlines what you're

182
00:07:15,339 --> 00:07:18,039
talking about in a way but as you know

183
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:20,849
the the entity of respect Taylor Swift

184
00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:23,800
accidentally dropped a zero-day which

185
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,729
and and Travis or Verde was the one that

186
00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:30,909
pointed out the zero day and that about

187
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:33,279
literally half an hour to an hour or

188
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:36,309
later there was a register article on on

189
00:07:36,309 --> 00:07:40,240
the zero day and and I thought that that

190
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,639
was late comedy gold

191
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,069
in a lot of ways and and I think you're

192
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:48,930
right I think folks that deliberately

193
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:52,599
can't take themselves so seriously and

194
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:55,599
just cannot get over themselves that was

195
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,149
just a brilliant situation where

196
00:07:58,149 --> 00:08:00,339
something accidentally happened it was

197
00:08:00,339 --> 00:08:04,659
big it forced the revocation of a

198
00:08:04,659 --> 00:08:08,830
certificate across a huge install base

199
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,620
did you follow that at all did you

200
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,659
yeah I was fine I mean what do you do

201
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,149
you think so again I wouldn't really

202
00:08:16,149 --> 00:08:17,680
call it a zero this is one of the things

203
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,479
I wouldn't call it a zero day fair and

204
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:20,830
you can call it a zero day because oh

205
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,509
wow they're you know I just discovered

206
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:23,979
this and it's like everybody can exploit

207
00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:26,080
it but the fact was it's just bad lazy

208
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,019
programming right I mean that's basic

209
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:30,159
right now I'm doing this in a knapsack

210
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:31,779
and you know helping some people without

211
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:35,349
second I'm like the first thing I get

212
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,448
all it's like securities and payments

213
00:08:37,448 --> 00:08:38,740
like we need to do this we need to do

214
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,059
this quickly it's like yeah but if you

215
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:42,159
you know if you want to get it things

216
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,380
done and you want to make it safe then

217
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,510
we need to build those controls in

218
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,220
sweat builders patrols if you should

219
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,570
start doing it from the right from the

220
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,350
beginning I that's this is where I also

221
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:56,260
get really you know back to your comment

222
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,449
area in stringent it's like that's not

223
00:08:58,449 --> 00:09:00,010
really a zero day right because that's

224
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,050
not there's nothing really broken there

225
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,029
it's just a bad programming practice so

226
00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:05,769
they put yeah they put the private key

227
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:08,380
inside an app and you know it's easily

228
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:12,010
accessible but is it a zero day no

229
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,149
you're not really breaking anything

230
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:15,790
you're just abusing the you're abusing

231
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,459
the system right lasting abuse yeah but

232
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:20,709
not really a zero day and and that's the

233
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:21,970
problem of our industry today too is

234
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,680
like oh I found this new for this

235
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,610
newfangled thing where let me see how

236
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,199
much press I can get of it let's see how

237
00:09:29,199 --> 00:09:31,570
things yeah it pisses me off because

238
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:34,089
suddenly week we've spoken behind a

239
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:35,740
couple of our bear farmers talks is this

240
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:39,220
idea of zero days being hip cool and

241
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:43,630
trendy if you're not to name in Mazzini

242
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,459
but if you're a research office and

243
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:47,079
working a project there and that's what

244
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:49,240
you get to do I have sympathy for

245
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,899
project zero now because and and and and

246
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:55,420
maybe canvas is almost a victim of this

247
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:59,220
because they their whole reason for

248
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:03,190
existence is to essentially tear apart

249
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:06,550
other company software in the interests

250
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:09,160
okay of making the world better place

251
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,139
but I think there's also another

252
00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:13,540
competing interest is that Google is a

253
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,360
corporation it likes to see its brand in

254
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,350
the in the news they feel that the idea

255
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:22,779
of calling out other software

256
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:26,079
manufacturers rapport security is a way

257
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,329
of contributing in a positive way

258
00:10:28,329 --> 00:10:30,579
through maybe this Machiavellian

259
00:10:30,579 --> 00:10:34,449
marketing lens but you know if these are

260
00:10:34,449 --> 00:10:36,910
the are the project zero researchers

261
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:42,610
just a victim of of a corporation so I

262
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:45,579
know I mean I know I feel that guys who

263
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:48,579
work in Google security team be a

264
00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:51,819
project zero or be it just plain you

265
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:55,570
know company guys a particular company

266
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:58,810
I don't I think they're a victim of

267
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:01,090
their own success to a certain extent

268
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:04,240
right they've that's the promise once

269
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,650
you get to that stage they I mean

270
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:06,850
they've done some really good work in

271
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,860
identifying things that have broken

272
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,270
right and they've done it in the right

273
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:13,570
way and so you get you get that labels

274
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,760
like oh you're a fantastic research are

275
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,470
you doing just a really great job and

276
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,180
that's great that's cool

277
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,220
but then anything that comes out of your

278
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,020
mouth seems to have this clique or this

279
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,000
following saying who this guy did you

280
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,860
know found this and Olli so you know

281
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,620
like don't even really have the words to

282
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,910
express it it's just it's just become

283
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,970
like the following you know like a cult

284
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:37,120
yeah yes yeah I'm the cause of zero day

285
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,550
we launched it today I just bought the

286
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:51,670
domain the day I mean I I protect my

287
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,500
enterprise and that's what I do that's

288
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,570
what they pay me for and I spend a lot

289
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,790
of time not worrying about zero days I

290
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:00,250
spend time looking at reading the news

291
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,780
and listening to people on Twitter talk

292
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,950
about that but what I care more about

293
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,750
and I've said this publicly is that the

294
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,550
bloody Debian boxes that have been sat

295
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,200
there fifteen years nobody knows about

296
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,050
yeah greed I mean that's like come on

297
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:14,320
let's face it it's like nobody's gonna

298
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,210
blow Zoo a day on an every day company

299
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,920
right right if you're going to blow the

300
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,000
zero day you're gonna blow it on

301
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,590
something really really [ __ ]

302
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,690
important yeah on some business trader

303
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:25,690
or some you know bank or some some you

304
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:28,360
know like commercial entity that has a

305
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,430
web presence in there has 10 DB in boxes

306
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:33,100
ever [ __ ] care about you know I mean

307
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,930
they probably will make you a target but

308
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,550
they've got much better ways to get at

309
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,210
you

310
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:39,130
where and that's where we go back to the

311
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,720
beginning which is the user right it's

312
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,720
like right yeah we're not giving the use

313
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,840
of the you know the proper abilities to

314
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,630
protect themselves or to to to do things

315
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:53,770
properly so it's an open door to so yes

316
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:56,680
literally when the job of most users is

317
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,050
to click on links we're trying to tell

318
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,330
them oh don't click on that link it's

319
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:04,300
like but but my job is to click on links

320
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,410
so I saw

321
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,139
think it was Europol you have this AG

322
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:11,449
going on on on protect yourself against

323
00:13:11,449 --> 00:13:13,910
malware okay it's like it's like flat

324
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,079
you know it's like one of those just

325
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:17,060
screaming Jess or whatever I saw it the

326
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,790
other day but it's not they're trying to

327
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:22,069
do positive thing try to teach people to

328
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:23,810
you know be careful what they're doing

329
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:26,839
but then in doing that that sequence it

330
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:29,420
goes only click on trusted websites on

331
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,420
trusted links I'm like how the [ __ ] is

332
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,430
an everyday person supposed to know what

333
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:38,990
a trusted link is good point I mean

334
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:42,139
absolutely that right it's like what we

335
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:43,250
don't give them anything to tell them

336
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:47,089
it's a trusted link as an industry the

337
00:13:47,089 --> 00:13:49,250
youth the vendors and the people that

338
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,850
provide all these or all these fancy

339
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,660
applications so they don't give them a

340
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,220
truck this means to actually tell you

341
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,259
mr. trusted Inc we have as InfoSec

342
00:13:57,259 --> 00:13:59,360
people had one you know do the md5 do

343
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,310
this got it you've got like we can put

344
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,930
the web server up and we can make sure

345
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:05,689
that only only like white list of URLs

346
00:14:05,689 --> 00:14:09,019
go through but the you know your

347
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:11,649
neighbor the old person down the street

348
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:14,089
how he's pushed enough but not really

349
00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:18,350
agreed completely great can ask you a

350
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:21,110
question about its kind of users but

351
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,110
it's it's more around users of social

352
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:28,420
media and there is a punch line of this

353
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,740
about 18 months ago you might remember

354
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,709
t-mobile Austria had a security incident

355
00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:38,319
and it was quite public and a couple of

356
00:14:38,319 --> 00:14:40,939
quite notable individuals kind of got

357
00:14:40,939 --> 00:14:43,430
involved in the ridicule side of things

358
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,740
and then very quickly it kind of

359
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,470
precipitated a very large pile up on to

360
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,180
the individual that was operating a

361
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,399
twitter account now I find that

362
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,500
incredibly distasteful and extremely

363
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,290
irresponsible for so-called

364
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,970
professionals in this industry to

365
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,410
participate you know and I wonder what

366
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:01,610
your thoughts are on that we don't say

367
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,559
it too much but when it happens it's a

368
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:06,860
it can be quite a [ __ ] stop I seem to

369
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,509
see it happen more often than we think

370
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:10,639
actually right I get a lot of people

371
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,410
like complaining about this or that

372
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:16,670
I saw one retweeted yesterday by Jack

373
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,620
Daniel I think

374
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,780
one of these types of things uses ship

375
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,610
well as we're back to the user shaming

376
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:25,820
you know it's I mean the guy's just

377
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,320
trying to do his job or whatever and

378
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:32,600
maybe he does it wrong then everybody

379
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,000
takes him apart right that's the point

380
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,120
yeah literally what's the point I mean

381
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,070
we're back to the [ __ ] playground and

382
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,920
we're ten years old it's like you know

383
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,510
I'm going back to this go up we're not

384
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,920
we're not a young industry anymore we

385
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,120
need to grow we need to stop this

386
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:53,530
similarly to that one remember the

387
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:56,120
couple years ago the data breach forum

388
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:04,700
in the UK is PSP talk talk ya thank ya

389
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:08,240
and you know CEO try to come on - on TV

390
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,240
try to explain what's going on

391
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,440
totally I'm [ __ ] prepared you know I

392
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,990
agree I that she was really badly

393
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,930
advised but instead of actually some

394
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,640
people are trying to pick up learning

395
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,890
points with half of our industry just

396
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,060
basically [ __ ] taught her a new

397
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,370
[ __ ] yeah which she did meet she was

398
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:26,540
already in too much so she was really

399
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:29,420
enough [ __ ] as it is you know it's I

400
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,310
mean we should you know we talked about

401
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:33,860
doing all this sharing and compromise

402
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,690
you know sharing information and

403
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,910
providing support for each other and you

404
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,560
know mentoring all this but then as soon

405
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,810
as something like oh I can get my I can

406
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:44,960
get my my my my two cents in and become

407
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,790
famous I'm gonna tear this person in

408
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,050
your [ __ ] just because it'll make me

409
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,880
look better because I know they're so

410
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,890
yeah really know better it's like let's

411
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,030
wait till tomorrow until something

412
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,290
happens it's happens to you and you

413
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:56,150
don't know any better and so everybody

414
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,620
else - she's she the same way

415
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,420
it's like treat people the way you want

416
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,980
to be treated don't stop you know like

417
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,890
taking people apart and just like just

418
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,810
because oh I can make a name for myself

419
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,670
where I can be in this tweet of tweet

420
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:11,420
feeding and be nice and nasty yes cyber

421
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,190

422
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:20,750

423
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:25,419
lines of Cori thank you

424
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,669
Thomas and I knew I could rely on you

425
00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:31,190
for the perfect setup for that quick

426
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,140
quick questions on this on maybe

427
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,720
something a little bit lighter so

428
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,070
besides London is probably I think the

429
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:40,039
biggest b-sides in the certainly in the

430
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:43,159
UK in terms of people attending it we

431
00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:45,049
have the privilege of giving a talk down

432
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:48,169
there this year what have you got

433
00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:49,640
planned for next year I'm sure it's

434
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,500
gonna be bigger and better and stuff

435
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,899
what you got in mind so next year is

436
00:17:53,899 --> 00:17:57,289
10th anniversary actually cool ha yeah

437
00:17:57,289 --> 00:17:58,669
these legends have been around for 10

438
00:17:58,669 --> 00:18:00,380
years so we're gonna have to do

439
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:03,080
something refreshing breath of InfoSec

440
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:13,490
week absolutely now it's still basically

441
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:14,450
up in the air right now

442
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:16,490
okay we need to figure out something to

443
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:19,159
do with usually planning a committee

444
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:21,889
start now so it's you know things are

445
00:18:21,889 --> 00:18:25,039
going to start getting getting done but

446
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,169
it's it's tough it's a tough it's tough

447
00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:32,120
I mean I I've been looking at all the

448
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,289
all the things I've been going on

449
00:18:33,289 --> 00:18:34,580
besides I'm going to show up I'm gonna

450
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,990
try and help with these so I stopped in

451
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:41,510
here now in Ireland we should have it we

452
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,250
should have a track in the pew King

453
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:48,200
Dragun the bar upstairs

454
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,990
yeah it's about done because we can for

455
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,549
that one we can only we can only do the

456
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:55,059
back room you know whether ah yeah I

457
00:18:55,059 --> 00:18:57,110
need to keep the rest of confirmed

458
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:00,590
normal guests because London's really

459
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:03,260
special for me was this huge yeah I mean

460
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:07,070
in 2018 it was my first public talk down

461
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:10,549
on track 3 I followed directly after a

462
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:13,700
McGill which was quite daunting did you

463
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,330
did the rookie track I get trapped 3 I

464
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:20,779
was upstairs okay yeah my talk was on

465
00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:22,519
web application firewalls and it seemed

466
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:24,260
to be well-received so I thought that's

467
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,850
all right not much for my first effort

468
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:28,039
but then winding the clock forward 12

469
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:28,610
months

470
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:31,549
turning up on the main track I think we

471
00:19:31,549 --> 00:19:33,740
had about 400 people in the room with

472
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,600
the bear farmers and we have the

473
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,730
privilege you've been joined by Troy

474
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:38,510
hunt the Scott

475
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,360
so it was a super special thing so for

476
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:41,690
me

477
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:44,750
because London is it has a special place

478
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,000
in my heart and it's spiritual home of

479
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,820
the beer farmers I think so and if we

480
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,290
can get down there for next year for

481
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,450
your 10th that would be superb so we'll

482
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:54,919
get we'll get our pencil sharpened and

483
00:19:54,919 --> 00:20:05,330
try for the CFP luck oh yeah well the

484
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,710
great thing you shouldn't has you know I

485
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,780
mean this is outside of outside of you

486
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,190
guys it's like this is this is a message

487
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:11,870
to everybody it's like if you have

488
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,220
something to share and you think you

489
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,470
know something you should try right if

490
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,549
you've never had it before and you're

491
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,320
afraid that's what the Ricci track is

492
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,720
for right so if you if this is if you if

493
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,070
you've never spoken you want to try

494
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,169
speaking sign up for the rookie track

495
00:20:24,169 --> 00:20:26,330
you know I mean we've it's a great way

496
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:28,429
to learn because you get a mentor you

497
00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:30,320
get somebody will help you you only have

498
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,780
to be up there for 15 minutes so it's

499
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,250
you know the time constraints makes it a

500
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:37,910
little bit easier and you get that

501
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,710
experience I mean you should be afraid

502
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:42,830
to talk and I think and I feel and this

503
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,510
is a problem that you know we could go

504
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:47,090
off this whole problem for hours but

505
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:49,610
we're back to that it all comes back to

506
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:51,799
you know that shaming aspect that we

507
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:53,030
were talking about earlier right

508
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:55,190
just the Twitter feed and stuff like

509
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,780
that it's like people some people are

510
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,520
afraid to talk because if they're afraid

511
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,650
that they're gonna be badly received and

512
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:03,380
it's a shame because you can you can

513
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,059
learn something from everybody right

514
00:21:05,059 --> 00:21:08,290
it's like this nobody has nothing to say

515
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:10,549
everybody has an opinion and that

516
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:12,410
opinion might give you something to

517
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:14,690
think about all of my talks today are

518
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,850
about changing changing your thought

519
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,919
process even my latest one but I've been

520
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:21,230
to it but I did last week a keepsake

521
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,299
you know it's a Maya talk but I'm not

522
00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:24,710
talking about anything in specific I'm

523
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,120
talking about think about what you're

524
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,620
doing and look at the way you're doing

525
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,840
things and maybe think that there might

526
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,760
be something better to do right or some

527
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,740
different way to do and that's why I

528
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,360
appreciate people would go up and stand

529
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,679
up on stage because even if they're

530
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:38,120
talking about the way that they did it

531
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,910
if they give you like a story and they

532
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:42,890
give you like this is what I found this

533
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:45,049
is how I fixed it you can learn

534
00:21:45,049 --> 00:21:46,760
something right there's always a tape

535
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,220
back completely agree and what we've

536
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,630
said in a number of our talks this year

537
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:51,559
that if you

538
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:52,789
you could have four hundred people in

539
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:54,110
the audience you can have five people in

540
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,659
the audience it doesn't matter if you

541
00:21:55,659 --> 00:21:58,039
materially change one individual and

542
00:21:58,039 --> 00:21:59,330
they leave that conference you go off

543
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:01,130
and do something positive that job done

544
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:04,039
right yeah I can see we can save the

545
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:06,289
industry one new person at a time
