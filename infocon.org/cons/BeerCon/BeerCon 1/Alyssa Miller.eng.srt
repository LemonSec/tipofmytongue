38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,570
quick

39
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,729
a hacker researcher security evangelist

40
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:51,720
you name it

41
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,619
yeah I I've been in security for fifteen

42
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:59,490
years or better part of almost 16 now

43
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,810
and yeah I've kind of been all over the

44
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:07,020
map right like I did a lot of work for a

45
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,149
financial technologies company working

46
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:10,810
on their internal systems as

47
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,370
pentester and running their

48
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,230
vulnerability management program and

49
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,240
then I got into consulting which is I've

50
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,959
been doing ever since and so I've seen a

51
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:21,850
lot of different things and over that

52
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,770
time I've gone from the very very

53
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:27,450
technical pen testing to working at

54
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,970
higher organizational levels with like

55
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,400
executives and stuff and trying to how

56
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,020
do we bridge that gap right and how do

57
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,780
we develop security as a program instead

58
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,060
of like okay I need to pen test this app

59
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,450
what's its how do I take care of 900

60
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:46,600
apps and you know 2,000 Network segments

61
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:51,310
and and so that's it's been a kind of a

62
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:56,260
cool evolution you know I kind of flew

63
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:00,010
under a flag of anonymity for a lot of

64
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:04,030
years and come in last I mean I did some

65
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,430
toxic cons but kind of in the last year

66
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,730
I've definitely made it a point to get

67
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,880
more openly involved I guess is how I

68
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,820
put it in the community so hey I guess

69
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,470
that's part of why I'm here today

70
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,090
well mission certainly accomplished I

71
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,880
mean you know I look at you know what

72
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,830
you're putting out in Twitter or what

73
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,270
you're doing in the community and its

74
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,100
really outstanding so I guess my

75
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,930
question is is how did you get started

76
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,570
and what kind of advice do you have for

77
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,940
folks growing up that kind of want to

78
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,400
move into some of the areas that you

79
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,910
specialize in sure so I always tell

80
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,920
people I got started was by accident so

81
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,320
I mean I started in university going for

82
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,330
a pre-med degree I was gonna be a doctor

83
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,670
but three semesters of chemistry made it

84
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,959
really clear that wasn't where I was

85
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,160
going

86
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,860
yeah I had been I had taught myself

87
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,890
programming in basic at like the age of

88
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,900
12 when I bought my first computer and

89
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,780
you know I discovered that the school I

90
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,330
was at had a computer science degree so

91
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,310
okay I'm not gonna do pre-med I'm gonna

92
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,480
go into computer science

93
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,910
well this is and I'm gonna age myself a

94
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,550
little bit we're talking you know mid

95
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:16,730
90s so dot-com boom anybody who could

96
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:19,370
program their way out of a paper bag had

97
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,589
a golden ticket to get a job you're

98
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:24,260
joining my startup called pets calm stay

99
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:31,850
huge yeah so I yeah I ended up falling

100
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,370
into a programming job full-time while

101
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:35,390
still in school

102
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,729
and that was with this financial

103
00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:39,290
technologies company well that after

104
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:42,260
nine years kind of rolled into someone

105
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,760
from their security team coming over and

106
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,530
saying hey can you be a part of our pen

107
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:48,620
test team and that rolled into leading

108
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,200
that team and I mean I was one of those

109
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,669
days where I'm like I've never been

110
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:54,380
tested I don't know anything about this

111
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,630
I'm just a developer and you know the

112
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,270
attitude back was oh you'll figure it

113
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:02,660
out and okay I guess I did you know is

114
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,450
it's what I've been doing ever since six

115
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:08,180
years there and now you know what

116
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,390
another nine years in consulting and

117
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:14,690
it's it's been a fun career and so I get

118
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,550
people who ask me the question you

119
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,130
mentioned well how do I get started in

120
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:23,450
security and you know one of the big

121
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:26,210
things I noticed is when people ask me

122
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:27,770
that the first thing I'll ask them back

123
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,810
I'll answer them with a question like

124
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,820
what harness

125
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,670
security do you want to get into or what

126
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:37,100
you know what where's your passion what

127
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,530
excites you because if you haven't sat

128
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:42,800
down and answered that question there's

129
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,960
nothing I can do to help you so what I

130
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,270
tell people is you know if you're

131
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,280
passionate and you haven't feel like you

132
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,170
want to get into security whether it's

133
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:53,510
you're interested in being it's a cop's

134
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,520
or you're interested in digital

135
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,290
forensics or you want to get a pen test

136
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,240
or whatever just figure out what it is

137
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,570
that you want to try and play with it do

138
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,930
what you can on your own you know but

139
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,880
kind of start to figure out where your

140
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,460
passions are where you think they are

141
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,900
now security is great like you can pick

142
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,970
a passion you can chase it you find out

143
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,740
after two years oh my god I hate this I

144
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,890
can't stand pentesting I'd rather you

145
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,200
know go and work on the sim and watch

146
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,610
the alerts and see what we can do to

147
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,340
respond and get into that peace okay

148
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,400
great you can make that switch but the

149
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,900
key is you've got to come in with a

150
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,710
passion for something I have told people

151
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:38,000
in numerous mentoring conversations you

152
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
know I would much rather hire somebody

153
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,450
as a hiring manager who has demonstrated

154
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:47,270
passion and has maybe done some informal

155
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,370
things they did some bug you know either

156
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,110
they played on the bug bounty or they

157
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,450
did some CTFs or they just you know

158
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,160
built a little environment on their

159
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,600
computer at home and VM and we're

160
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,520
playing with birch under something you

161
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,270
know something that shows they have a

162
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,970
passion then somebody who went to you

163
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:05,930
know some four-year degree program and

164
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:07,610
then they got all sorts of certs but

165
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,170
they've never really actually used the

166
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:12,590
tools in any practical sense you know

167
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,810
I'd much rather that person who shows

168
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,020
that passion and so I try to kind of

169
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,730
coach people that way like find what

170
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,220
excites you and go after it

171
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:26,180
very very cool so what are you seeing is

172
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,130
the biggest security sort of challenges

173
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:31,040
is it attracting people to profession

174
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,560
that can be really you know difficult

175
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,060
and and a bit depressing or is it

176
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,590
retaining the the people that we have

177
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,570
like do you see a lot of people going oh

178
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:44,100
I'm done man I just I can

179
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,950
can't do this anymore what do you see um

180
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,650
god it's it's definitely both right I

181
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:50,880
don't know I don't know that I can

182
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,620
classify what the bigger challenge is

183
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,970
there's definitely the burnout issue

184
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:56,670
that's a big issue and I think some of

185
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,620
it honestly is maybe self-inflicted a

186
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,680
little bit I think we get so excited and

187
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,630
so passionate about the things we do and

188
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:06,300
let's face it most of us insecurities

189
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,520
we're pretty idealistic we want to save

190
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,630
we want to defend the planet you know

191
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:15,390
that's so it becomes easy for employers

192
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:18,420
to kind of exploit that and and not even

193
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,160
necessarily intentionally but you've got

194
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,410
this person who's so willing to just

195
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,850
keep working and to work all hours

196
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,740
because their passion drives them to

197
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,830
just keep digging yeah but on the flip

198
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:31,860
side and I was I was really kind of

199
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,450
freaking out last night I was so excited

200
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,880
I was in the car listening when kirsten

201
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,549
was on and she she called my name a

202
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:40,880
couple times that yeah like oh my god

203
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,349
but she point out the other thing that I

204
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:45,390
think is really key is we talked about

205
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:48,600
this skills gap I'm not sure I buy into

206
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,610
that I mean there is you know there's

207
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,200
definitely it's hard to find the skilled

208
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,550
people when you go out and look and week

209
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,710
there's no doubt this industry still as

210
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,240
a negative unemployment rate which

211
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,470
financially for us is quite leibniz yep

212
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:05,460
yeah always be jobs out there but you

213
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,200
look at job descriptions like she was

214
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,390
talking about last night these hideous

215
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,580
job descriptions and we joke about it on

216
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,250
Twitter all the time you're the the you

217
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,370
know entry-level position that requires

218
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,240
a CISSP yeah what you can't even get

219
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,130
that without five years of actual work

220
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,500
experience yes or G AK or crest

221
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,530
certified yeah yeah who on their own is

222
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,120
paying for a GF before they've ever had

223
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,980
a job right thirty-seven thousand a year

224
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:38,220
to start that job posting that you know

225
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,720
she put up there last night which T

226
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,840
profit originally called - and like you

227
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,790
know forty bullet points under

228
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,220
requirement yeah not optional

229
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:51,210
retirements do you do you think I mean I

230
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:53,870
did raise this question to him I think

231
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,040
to some aspect it's

232
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,839
those that are asking for the jobs -

233
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,220
aren't even sure what they're looking

234
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,940
for so I mean the fact that I asking for

235
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:06,300
CSP for a junior on unaware of what that

236
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,519
actually entails do you think I just

237
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,199
hear these budgets words and like oh

238
00:10:10,199 --> 00:10:11,970
let's just throw it in there and it

239
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:15,089
might make us look better oh I think so

240
00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:16,050
absolutely

241
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,870
if you look at a lot of the job matching

242
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:21,889
algorithms on things like LinkedIn or

243
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:25,110
indeed or any of those yeah that's part

244
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:27,300
of what they're looking at is you know

245
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,500
they're just trying I mean think of all

246
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,529
the times you or I get her a message

247
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:33,600
from a recruiter because they saw we had

248
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,269
some certification yeah I can think back

249
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:38,220
to I actually at one point he had a ceh

250
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,069
and I put it on my LinkedIn profile and

251
00:10:41,069 --> 00:10:42,720
I removed it within months because the

252
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,399
minute I put on my LinkedIn profile I

253
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,470
was getting messages from all over the

254
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:46,920
place

255
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,350
wanting to know if y'all I wanted this

256
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,449
entry-level analyst job and I'm sitting

257
00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:54,329
there thinking if I tell you my salary

258
00:10:54,329 --> 00:10:57,269
requirements were probably not yeah yeah

259
00:10:57,269 --> 00:11:01,350
I put my Yamaha keyboard certificate on

260
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,810
there and I got that offered Marie

261
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:08,490
pariahs job with with it no but you're a

262
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,230
hundred percent callin it out the way

263
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,510
the way it should be because yeah I mean

264
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,639
a lot of this is done by algorithms I

265
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:17,610
mean there is a certain art to SEO in

266
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:22,560
your own resume for good or for bad and

267
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,660
then you know there comes down to this

268
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,250
issue and I think you know I saw that

269
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,260
thing on Twitter where somebody was

270
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,810
looking for twelve years of AWS cloud

271
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:33,959
experience right which you know oh

272
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:38,939
you're looking for Jeff Bezos is like

273
00:11:38,939 --> 00:11:41,610
what the hell so so Alissa what are the

274
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:45,089
skills that a person needs today like if

275
00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:47,910
I was like graduating high school

276
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:51,029
pretty decent marks do I do a computer

277
00:11:51,029 --> 00:11:54,389
science degree do i do CompTIA certs do

278
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:57,300
I just you know start at a helpdesk what

279
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,579
would you what what path to adventure

280
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:03,120
would you would you pick so let's start

281
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,529
with degrees I honestly would stay away

282
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:09,320
from the computer science degree

283
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,550
unless you're looking to get into

284
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,740
programming in fact I will honestly say

285
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,350
and this many are gonna disagree with me

286
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,300
on this I would stay away from any of

287
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,150
these cybersecurity degrees mom okay I

288
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,820
would much rather see somebody who wants

289
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,460
to get into security get some type of

290
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,950
business-related degree right because

291
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,600
you know a circuit SWAT was on here

292
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,070
earlier and she mentioned empathy and

293
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,690
she was talking in terms of developers

294
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:33,980
but it's actually kind of bi-directional

295
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,890
and I think insecurities need to have

296
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:39,020
empathy for our business leaders to and

297
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:42,350
understand what are they looking at you

298
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,120
know we run around insecurities we're

299
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,560
always angry listen we're social stupid

300
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,450
they don't understand how serious the

301
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:53,960
threat is well in the kind of our job to

302
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,730
tell them how serious it is and get

303
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,520
beyond that so emotional intelligence

304
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,620
empathy that's where that comes in and

305
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,900
by having something that gives you that

306
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,170
business context you know the technical

307
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:08,540
stuff is gonna shift so fast and it has

308
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,700
I mean let's let's face it technology is

309
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:14,330
so dynamic these days that trying to

310
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,650
keep up with that in a degree program

311
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:18,650
just doesn't really it's not effective I

312
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:21,680
mean 1995 I'm in a computer science

313
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,450
degree doing assembler programming

314
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,970
writing an operating system mm-hmm

315
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:29,060
yeah I used assembler once since then

316
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,260
now of course you know you get into

317
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,820
hacking and all of a sudden great yeah I

318
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,850
was good to know assembler but um you

319
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:37,910
know in general computer programmer just

320
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,650
don't need to know assembler there's far

321
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,060
more effective ways they could have been

322
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,920
if they had taken some time to teach me

323
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,260
at that time visual c++ would have been

324
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,560
far more effective yeah

325
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:52,010
but there's so many ways otherwise to

326
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,660
get involved in the technology side of I

327
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,040
mentioned some of them before getting

328
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,840
involved in CTF so all these local

329
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,750
conferences most of these sites have all

330
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,190
these villages where you can get your

331
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:03,590
hands on the tech you can play with this

332
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,990
stuff I mean I went to b-sides Denver

333
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:09,140
and I was playing with SDR hacking you

334
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,090
know I'm software-defined radio and I'm

335
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,260
messing around with that stuff like

336
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,600
seriously this is cool if it doesn't

337
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,430
work out many of our people can be

338
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:19,569
passable locksmiths

339
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,649
I thought that I'll show you how to

340
00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:27,899
break into that concert yeah talking

341
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:29,970
about tools like one taught our farm

342
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,100
person that's really helped me and learn

343
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,100
a lot to engage those Twitter the ESO

344
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,980
gets a lot of bad press but perceptions

345
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,839
but I found Twitter's really helped me

346
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,180
personally do you find something

347
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,579
somewhere oh absolutely

348
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:46,649
so I mean I my Twitter account I think

349
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:49,649
is five years old at the start of this

350
00:14:49,649 --> 00:14:51,510
year I had 65 followers because I didn't

351
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,730
use it and part of what I told you

352
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,110
before like I'm gonna get active in the

353
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,510
community I you know I was done being

354
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,430
anonymous one of the big things I did

355
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:02,339
was I just started to engage and I mean

356
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:04,410
you know the wonderful thing about

357
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:06,389
Twitter you know is also a thing that

358
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:07,440
makes it horrible at times and that's

359
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,540
the fact that anybody can see and

360
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,360
respond to anybody else's tweets you

361
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,680
know I mean yeah you can mark your

362
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,889
profile private but most people don't

363
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:18,029
but the fact that I could go out there

364
00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:20,579
and I could get involved in a

365
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:22,500
conversation with some of my heroes I

366
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,130
could talk directly to you know Jeremiah

367
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:29,970
Grossman or Jason Street or Katy who was

368
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:33,029
just on before me you know being able to

369
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:34,560
talk to these people and interact with

370
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,980
them is such a huge thing and to be able

371
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,230
to bounce your ideas and and get

372
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,000
feedback yeah sometimes you'll say

373
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,889
something really stupid and people will

374
00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:44,930
slap you upside the head

375
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:46,620
sometimes you'll say something

376
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,420
incredibly intelligent but people don't

377
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,480
like it and they'll come after you but

378
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,130
being out there being present and that

379
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:55,560
ability to really share a lot of

380
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,079
information internationally really

381
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,170
quickly is its dumbfounding to me I love

382
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,360
how our community comes together out

383
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,089
there even with all the trauma really

384
00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:09,060
okay you know it's interesting because I

385
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,730
think the consensus view right now but

386
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:14,550
Twitter has been generally really super

387
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:17,490
positive and and that that feels kind of

388
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:19,769
my heart with joy and I think you know I

389
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:22,529
I encouraged a master's class that I

390
00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:24,240
lectured at at the University of

391
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,940
Manchester to get on Twitter because

392
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,220
that's where the action was was

393
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,990
happening and I gave them the warning

394
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,290
saying you know like beef be circumspect

395
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:36,810
you know try to use neutral language

396
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:41,339
that gives you an out like may could you

397
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:44,100
know but um I think there is a lot of

398
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,110
value in our community I certainly have

399
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:48,149
seen you know an example of our

400
00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:51,360
community rallying behind various people

401
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,300
you know especially a hacker fantastic

402
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,190
math that we just had on with the

403
00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:00,350
controversy of packer house etc um

404
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,190
valuable resource

405
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,160
how important is those are those new

406
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,280
people going to those b-sides

407
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,220
conferences and and and like trying

408
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,020
their hand at the rookie track

409
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:16,319
I personally to me it's exceptionally

410
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,959
important and it's it's not just the

411
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,760
skills that you can learn by playing

412
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,980
with some of those things it's its

413
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,349
meaning people and it can be tough like

414
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:27,660
you know the first however many years I

415
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,970
was going to conferences I was speaking

416
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:31,620
at conferences and I was still afraid to

417
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,900
go up and talk to people you know it was

418
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,360
very difficult I'm socially awkward in

419
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,580
general and a lot of people in this

420
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,030
space tend to be so it can be tough but

421
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,600
especially when you get into the

422
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,130
villages and stuff that's where you end

423
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,750
up sitting next to somebody else

424
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,429
you start joking about you know what

425
00:17:47,429 --> 00:17:49,200
you're working on or anything else and

426
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,330
before you know it you you've made a

427
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:54,809
friend and let's pose discovered an FBI

428
00:17:54,809 --> 00:18:02,850
agent to piped a Def Con yeah but we

429
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,159
know in security that network is so

430
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:07,290
important yeah that's what makes Twitter

431
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:08,340
great that's what makes these

432
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,230
conferences great just being able to

433
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,780
network with people you need a job throw

434
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,640
it out on Twitter all of a sudden you've

435
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,549
got I mean everybody's retweeting open

436
00:18:17,549 --> 00:18:19,020
job positions people that are searching

437
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,880
for jobs and people are getting

438
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,010
connected out there it's wonderful to

439
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:25,549
see and so yeah I mean you go to these

440
00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:27,870
these industry and hands and there's

441
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:30,210
there's just so much you can do in terms

442
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,610
of not just learning new skill sets but

443
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,350
also just networking in the community

444
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:37,350
and becoming an active part of it I just

445
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:40,230
want to add and so last year I had some

446
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:43,080
personal problems and it was a really

447
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,950
tough time for me and

448
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:48,580
the beer farmers which the only reason

449
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,320
they'd ever formed was because of

450
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,480
Twitter really helped me through that so

451
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,780
it's not just the security you know the

452
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,580
technical stuff there's the whole human

453
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:00,940
aspect as well oh absolutely I mean and

454
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,380
I've had my share of that too you know

455
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,180
maybe not a I'm familiar with your

456
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,700
situation and that was much grander than

457
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,840
you know some of the things I've been

458
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,140
dealing with publicly on Twitter but you

459
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,480
know I've done that too and I think we

460
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,220
all do we kind of put that out there I

461
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,960
mean my favorite story of that was

462
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,760
hacker summer camp this last year in

463
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,190
Vegas you know I had been out there all

464
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:23,410
week and it was kind of the last day and

465
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:25,900
I mean I had just been in amongst the

466
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,910
crowds and got to that point as it does

467
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:30,940
for so many people out there that I'm

468
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,290
just overwhelmed you know I've been

469
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:33,820
dealing with all this different stuff

470
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,460
that was going on and and I come back to

471
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,590
my hotel room my rooms locked and so I

472
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,930
tweet about it or it wasn't like excuse

473
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,480
me there's you know the the housekeeping

474
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,910
is in there so I came into my room and I

475
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:48,130
just tweeted out like oh my god you know

476
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,630
I can't believe this I just want to hide

477
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,130
in my room and I can't even in my room I

478
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,480
gotta go back to the hotel lobby and

479
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,310
hide out somewhere down there and the

480
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,860
next thing I know I got ray redacted you

481
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,720
know sending me a message back says hey

482
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,880
are you in this hotel yeah that's where

483
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,000
I am oh oh come over the bar and let's

484
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,030
let's check I mean is just a delightful

485
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:10,360
human being such a great guy so

486
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,120
intuitive of what people need you know

487
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,640
yeah exactly and that's why I tell him

488
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,410
every almost every time we interact just

489
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:19,420
how much that moment meant to me that

490
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,490
