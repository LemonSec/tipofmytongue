1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:01,829
esteemed colleague and friend Ian

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:03,689
Thornton Trump who the guy heard

3
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:06,750
giggling just there took it to the next

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,660
level and what he decided was a great

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,090
idea was to invite practically everybody

6
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,190
out in the information security industry

7
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,580
to get involved no one cares what we

8
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,410
think and what we want to know what you

9
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,720
think well I think yeah I think you're

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,859
right I think we would have been just

11
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:24,210
filler really yeah

12
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,119
and what we really need was killer and

13
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,029
that's what we've done so we've got a

14
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:32,820
session starting now probably going to

15
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,130
run for the next 24 hours what we've got

16
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,070
is a whole bunch of people people at you

17
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,329
in the information security and world of

18
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:42,090
household names people are just behind

19
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,129
the scenes doing really cool stuff we've

20
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:47,129
got everybody involved and why we're

21
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:49,320
doing it well why not and the whole

22
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,940
point of it really is to raise money for

23
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,610
charity the charities that we selected

24
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:54,780
on the Electronic Frontier Foundation

25
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,260
and mental health hackers who a couple

26
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,170
of organizations really close to the

27
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,270
heart of everything that we do and close

28
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,559
to the heart of the people involved so

29
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,600
that's that's why we chose those people

30
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,210
and for reasons that we'll discuss later

31
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,210
on in the podcast there are sometimes

32
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:13,619
times where you just want to rip the

33
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:15,840
heart out of certain organizations that

34
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,970
you're trying to give money to and they

35
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,540
think you are being suspicious or doing

36
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,509
something strange so communication

37
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:26,850
problems abound and that's something

38
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,890
that we a central theme that we'll talk

39
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,009
about going forward for the next 24

40
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:32,369
hours

41
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:36,240
absolutely so what's the plan we haven't

42
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,860
really got a plan the bear farmers are

43
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,200
not really noted for having plans but

44
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,490
what we're going to do is we're going to

45
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,740
invite people to come along and watch

46
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,180
out and they're gonna tell us things

47
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,450
that they've experienced in 2019 some of

48
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,040
the stuff that maybes WAM the Bob Paul

49
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,630
made them angry so we'll have fun things

50
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,189
that they've got a really cool an

51
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:55,380
interesting experiments or it's a

52
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,450
research that they've done or maybe just

53
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,100
look at what they think 2020 is gonna

54
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,020
look like predicting the next 12 months

55
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,909
is quite a popular hobby information

56
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:04,860
security so why not do a bit of that

57
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,479
tonight

58
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,399
just get in the parental advisory out of

59
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,199
the way we're not in control of what

60
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,030
people say tonight there isn't really

61
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,730
any kind of census going sensoring going

62
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,230
on so people are free to say what they

63
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,420
want to say Luna's a code of conduct

64
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,580
that might be available on the discord

65
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,110
channel if you can get on there and read

66
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,030
it but what we want people to be is is

67
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,370
cool have a good time not be a dick with

68
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:29,010
each other there are moderates kicking

69
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,320
around so if things do go a little bit

70
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,600
left or south then you know we may have

71
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,260
to step it in terms of speakers so we've

72
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,630
got I think 50 speakers in the agenda

73
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,750
which is really ace they've got a

74
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,730
20-minute slot but that's not not really

75
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,290
strict but I'm going to hold people to

76
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,270
it but we want people to work around

77
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,540
that kind of time scale what you are

78
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,370
gonna hear are people's thoughts so

79
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,020
there isn't again really much of an

80
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,459
agenda people are free to speak about

81
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:58,680
the like providing that it's some kind

82
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,540
of loose association with the industry

83
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,760
in the world that we're in if you've got

84
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,070
any questions then just drop them in the

85
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,560
twitch and we'll try and grab them and

86
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,180
make sure that they find the way of the

87
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,300
relevant speaker if we can pronunciation

88
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,520
of names and handles so we've got people

89
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,890
from all around the planet which is why

90
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:20,970
this is a 24-hour thing so we do

91
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,590
apologize in advance if we don't get

92
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,269
your name right but I'm sure you'll let

93
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:27,510
us know if if that happens a couple more

94
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,000
things from me thanks very much you need

95
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,980
to the many hats Club okay we originally

96
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,600
intended for this to be held purely

97
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,540
discord but there's a problem upstream

98
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,000
of Google who hosts the platform they've

99
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,680
got a technical issue with their storage

100
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,260
arrays and so therefore we cut to fall

101
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,000
back to plan B which is great because we

102
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,390
had and have a plan B but behind the

103
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,040
scenes are a whole bunch of people are

104
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,750
recording it piping it making short

105
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,000
stuff works and I want to say up front

106
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,739
thanks very much for those people thank

107
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:57,900
you very much and finally from me for

108
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,640
the time being is just have a great time

listen and learn have fun that's what

110
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,019
this is all about and then ultimately we

111
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:06,329
want you to donate money so links will

112
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:09,030

113
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,920
to our GoFundMe page where you could

114
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,959
give us sure as little as you can afford

115
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,640
we'd really appreciate it

116
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,089
have a good time and so over to Stuart

117
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:21,089
yeah still we couldn't do it without ya

118
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:22,500
brother

119
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,930
yeah aren't me if I discourse over

120
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:34,740
weights right so so yeah it's been

121
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,480
amazing actually I have to say that

122
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,040
there's been quite a few people here in

123
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:48,210
his a reg sec which remains to be seen

124
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:52,580
but yeah yeah everyone's speaking to be

125
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,650
farmers and also there's great causes I

126
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,980
think you know internet freedoms mental

127
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:04,790
health really important so yeah I think

128
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,630
so stew in in the tradition of beer con

129
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:13,520
1 we got to ask you a question what was

130
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,140
2019 like you let me to like for you

131
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,870
because you had a huge hear the many

132
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,150
hats Club it seems gone into the next

133
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:56,540
level highlight for me actually was

134
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,410
actually doing a talk on mental health

135
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,690
which is which is really difficult

136
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,729
because a lot people don't talk about

137
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:04,650
that and maybe not enough that's

138
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:10,950
probably why the after it realized that

139
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,800
it helps a lot of people so yeah that

140
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,970
was a massive highlight and then of

141
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:19,380
course maybe maybe the the John McAfee

142
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,120
podcast just because I'd be trying to

143
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,400
get it to talk to in 18 months and then

144
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,840
actually realize how insane he actually

145
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,180
was so that was yeah it was pretty

146
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,520
pretty cool I guess that was genius you

147
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,860
really enjoyed it

148
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,639
it was interesting I don't know where

149
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:38,460
he's gonna go and yeah and it went

150
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:43,500
everywhere there were two things came

151
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,569
out of that for me and again it was hats

152
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:47,639
off to you for for putting out on making

153
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,550
it happen but when asked around bath

154
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,229
salts

155
00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:54,300
he gave an incredibly analytical

156
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,879
description of how to do the right thing

157
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:59,340
with bath salts you know you take a

158
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,900
little too little and nothing happens

159
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,550
you take a little too much and it's a

160
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,460
zombie death and then when asked around

161
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,509
the the question asked the question

162
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:12,780
around fornication with whales he said

163
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,520
he'd never done it but then he proceeded

164
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,289
to give a really detailed explanation of

165
00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:19,289
