1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,389
excellent so welcome James Chapel hello

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:07,049
thanks for joining us on your Sunday

3
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:09,450
lunchtime would you mind introducing

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,670
yourself to the people listening yeah

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,089
sure so on James Chapel I'm kind of

6
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:16,800
interested in digital footprints and

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,990
what digital footprints means a security

8
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,810
business's been doing that now for the

9
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,240
last eight years I've been in InfoSec I

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,609
guess for about fifteen or sixteen start

11
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:28,470
off in telecoms then it's been about ten

12
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,140
years in consulting prior to starting

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,969
this footprints journey in 2011

14
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,540
so I think Matt's gonna meet em I'll

15
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,190
take over

16
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:49,410
so 2019 was a good year for you anything

17
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,460
to effect back on it's been a

18
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,650
fascinating year from my perspective and

19
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,290
I guess we've seen a whole bunch of

20
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,989
different things change so I was quite I

21
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:03,150
was I saw we saw testing a little bit

22
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,550
about some of the sort of

23
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,300
vulnerabilities you had some interesting

24
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,430
ones I thought the twenty nineteen oh

25
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,289
seven oh eight or a police he was an

26
00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:12,840
interesting one to track we do I look at

27
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,479
sort of threat threats from publicly

28
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:17,310
available information it was interesting

29
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,530
to see how that unfolded and how that

30
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,110
was discussed and I think sort of the

31
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,570
way that data losses continue to

32
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,520
accelerate has been super super

33
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,050
interesting I think looking at just sort

34
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,330
of the digitization of crime I think

35
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,420
he's so quite another interesting sort

36
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,190
of you know really become quite

37
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,840
industrialized in a way that hasn't been

38
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,599
for a very long time either so yeah yeah

39
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:45,179
it's been I think twenty nine super

40
00:01:45,179 --> 00:01:47,009
super interesting I think those are

41
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:48,569
things though I think that will continue

42
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:50,580
to accelerate throughout next year as

43
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,679
well yeah I think that's a very fair

44
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:53,580
statement

45
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,069
we've got Zack in who you are joining in

46
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:58,319
your slots or is joining you Zack would

47
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,190
you come meet your microphone cause

48
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,869
they'd open meet so hey guys how you

49
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:08,280
doing Zack good okay just for the

50
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,479
benefit of people who are not familiar

51
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,068
with you could you just tell us who you

52
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:15,060
are what you do yeah so come the hats I

53
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,650
used to work to think of this James

54
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,950
actually which is a weird coincidence we

55
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,959
plan today we planned it well what a

56
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:24,780
proponent we overlap to a company called

57
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,580
data which was a cyber security business

58
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,739
which is now part of VA so that kind of

59
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:31,319
explains where I got the cyber bugs Ron

60
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,090
yeah I guess two hats I run a

61
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,040
surveillance business right now which

62
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,980
focuses on video surveillance and facial

63
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,690
recognition and exciting stuff like that

64
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,180
working for various government agencies

65
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,730
around the world and then I also bright

66
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:48,000
opinionated um kind of monologues around

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,550
cyber security and when things

68
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,580
take my interest or my feel are worthy

69
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,290
of a bit of a runt so that's where I

70
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,760
guess most people probably familiar with

71
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,630
them bad dancing but the one thing I

72
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,400
wanted to ask both you guys did do you

73
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,900
guys see the the threat landscape

74
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,240
changing like the threat actors do you

75
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:12,540
see the different trends I have it have

76
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,270
a good cook I know that definitely so I

77
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,070
think what a couple of interesting

78
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,530
things so the level of industrialization

79
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,420
that we see in things like fraud has

80
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,850
changed enormously so if you look at

81
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,100
something simple like business eval

82
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,260
compromised fraud you know there's no

83
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:32,040
toolkits and that the scale of those

84
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,180
crimes is you know risen hugely I think

85
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,910
also it's gone from so like high falling

86
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,090
low value to low volume high value as

87
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,590
well that's on another shift I think

88
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,820
you've seen a lot so a lot more time

89
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,620
contains a lot less sort of generic

90
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,090
science of I I would agree with that I

91
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,240
mean the fact that you can customize by

92
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,970
region by language your phishing emails

93
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,450
from from kits that are available online

94
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:03,300
truly industrial levels I can currently

95
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,900
agree with that Zack are you seeing sort

96
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,940
of advanced persistent threat actor

97
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,040
techniques bleed over into the more

98
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,730
common criminal activities or is there

99
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,829
still sort of a differentiation between

100
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:20,250
the the low skilled actor and the apt

101
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,920
actor I think at a basic level there's

102
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,360
clearly a difference the level of

103
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,520
sophistication across the the

104
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,010
state-sponsored guys is different other

105
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,720
things but I think in both spheres it's

106
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,890
been a really interesting year I think

107
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,780
we'll look back on this year has been

108
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,210
quite seminal I think on the the generic

109
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,510
cybercrime side you know attacks on you

110
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,070
know mainstream platforms clearly

111
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,500
Android and iOS I think you'll see more

112
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,200
of that this year than ever before

113
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,400
probably users have lost their innocence

114
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,720
a bit this year I think if you've got an

115
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,730
Android device and haven't yet clocked

116
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,560
the issue then you've clearly not been

117
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,200
on the installment an Apple which is

118
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,210
always played that you know the secure

119
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:57,960
ring-fence

120
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,180
card has you know had a couple of

121
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,400
punches to the nose this year and is now

122
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,410
in recovery

123
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,840
I think on the kind of a nation-state

124
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,940
side it's actually even more interesting

125
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,150
although clearly less publicized I think

126
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,800
we see I've kind of talked before about

127
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,140
the coming together of the cyber domain

128
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,690
and the physical domain and we've seen

129
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:19,490
kind of an action in one sphere being

130
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,920
kind of we've seen retaliation in the

131
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,480
other and if you go talk to senior

132
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,130
military leaders that's a hybrid warfare

133
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,630
role the media

134
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,760
they've got cyber security division as

135
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,020
they're standing up there looking at

136
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,790
social media we have not seen that

137
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,270
before

138
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,830
and I think you know again we'll look

139
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,840
back at this year as the year that kind

140
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,430
of aid the high end national security

141
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:40,330
military sphere kind of changed for good

142
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,670
James how do you see the cybercriminal

143
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:46,520
adapting is it going to be a case of if

144
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,800
you're not using the latest tools if

145
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,870
you're not emulating or learning from

146
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,750
apts you'll be out of the game because

147
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,990
our defenses are gonna be sort of set at

148
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,960
that low-level bar or what do you think

149
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,000
I see is quite quite interesting I was

150
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,230
chatting to a couple of people this week

151
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,950
about just cryptolocker ransomware where

152
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,200
the actor had gone in and used remote

153
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,270
access tool kits to case the joints work

154
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,030
out who they treat target which team

155
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,530
they should target first before they go

156
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,360
in we're also seeing that with things

157
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,100
like invoice fraud as well and seeing

158
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,020
sort of again remote access tool kit

159
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,380
again probably a bit more route

160
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,700
commodity so they're using to the known

161
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,770
vulnerabilities but as we know most

162
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,630
organizations have some of those

163
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:33,260
vulnerabilities in them and then you

164
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,810
might not see O'Day's quite as quite as

165
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,700
regularly with a criminal audience but

166
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,710
they certainly they're not they're not

167
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:42,110
doing simple stuff they did their dreams

168
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,940
or fairly advanced with getting in

169
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:47,090
spending time casing the joint because

170
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,180
the payoff now is so much bigger than it

171
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,710
used to be we're not talking about a few

172
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,180
hundred dollars we're talking about you

173
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,070
know hundreds of thousands of pounds we

174
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:55,850
especially look at things like

175
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,800
construction industry bond getting

176
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,350
between the you know the invoice the

177
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,060
payment for a big concrete pourer and a

178
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,860
building for example that's hundreds of

179
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,110
thousands of pounds in one one here so

180
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,670
they'll spend time on it and they'll

181
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,590
properly place the joint so are you

182
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,630
suggesting that the delays in cross rail

183
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:15,710
may be cyberattack about it I'm sure if

184
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,060
they could rely events

185
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:21,320
right it's been Zach you know that that

186
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,850
brings me to you know a really

187
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,800
interesting sort of point like as a

188
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,740
journalist at some point you have to

189
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,280
assert a theory and it seems to me that

190
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,430
a lot of the time it's ephemeral that

191
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:37,070
it's a very much a changing situation on

192
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,470
the ground how do you sort of approach

193
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,090
that from a journalistic perspective

194
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:44,090
because as you probably are aware there

195
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,820
are many people out on Twitter that are

196
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:51,790
all too quick to criticize a journalism

197
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:55,100
InfoSec oh that's wrong and I think you

198
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,420
know and again there's different levels

199
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,100
I mean we're peeling an onion here right

200
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,810
and it's the really interesting thing

201
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,820
about trying to cover the the threat as

202
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,980
the nation-state goes is this you know

203
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,470
attribution is always assumed or you're

204
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,730
kind of trying to join the dots you

205
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,470
don't know and I think what we've seen

206
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,720
in the last few months is some really

207
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,430
interesting research around trying to

208
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,440
join the dots er we've seen real

209
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,240
differences between what's happening say

210
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,460
Russia and China you've seen you know

211
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,380
North Korea and Iran really trying to

212
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,540
step up to the table you know just in

213
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,860
the last couple of days you've seen you

214
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,720
know further stuff coming out of Vietnam

215
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,910
and I think what you know what that is

216
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,200
doing is putting into the public domain

217
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,630
or the shadowy public domain some

218
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,490
serious cyber tools that are then being

219
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,620
picked up by the cyber criminals so you

220
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,720
go into the dark web right now and there

221
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,669
are you know state-sponsored toolkits

222
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:42,260
that are available that are being sold

223
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,260
and I think you know what we've seen as

224
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,670
well as is the commercial

225
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,560
entrepreneurialship if you like of some

226
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,670
of the nation-state guys I mean these

227
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,290
are arm's length guys right so they are

228
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,910
and they're not they're not carrying

229
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,560
government creds so they're they're

230
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,330
clearly you know moonlighting of an eye

231
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,670
and make a few quid for themselves and

232
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,350
that is putting some serious tools into

233
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,360
the public domain you asked the question

234
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,830
before in terms of levels of

235
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:06,500
sophistication and what's changed as you

236
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,850
use and we all see they be more

237
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,650
compromised stuff that comes into every

238
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,330
business and then it's easy to spot a

239
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,040
lot of stuff is not easy to spot anymore

240
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,450
and you kind of look at it anything

241
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,130
beyond that seriously clever you know

242
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,050
they they used you they receive what

243
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,730
you're interested in they picked up some

244
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:22,430
of your interest and you you really have

245
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,170
to have your wits about you and that's

246
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,180
you and and it's really quite hard to

247
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,650
work out as a someone who runs an

248
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,180
organization how you train people to

249
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,610
spot that stuff

250
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:33,130
can I ask you a question guys and what

251
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,930
are your thoughts on the things that

252
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:37,030
we've seen an increase in the last 12

253
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:40,780
months around nations fallen out with

254
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,210
nations at a tech level so the example

255
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:45,610
I'm gonna cite is far away okay

256
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:48,520
so America and Canada for that matter

257
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,870
I've got a little bit pissed up with a

258
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,540
while way for various different reasons

259
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,700
some of that bled into the UK the LCSC I

260
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:59,050
have you on it long story short you

261
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,900
winded up with Google or America

262
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,590
embargoing

263
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,720
us companies from dealing with Hawaii

264
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,090
which led to Google stopping support for

265
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:10,750
their Android OS and ultimately led to

266
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,310
her while we have a fast traffic's

267
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:15,460
development so no less now it seems it

268
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,010
seemed to me at the time I working in in

269
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,540
telecommunications a week we are

270
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,010
familiar with the while ways and provide

271
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,760
it it seemed very tip for tart and very

272
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,560
trade allege rather than Security

273
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,910
Letters - what are your thoughts on that

274
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,570
chat

275
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:34,450
I haven't give us one but so it's quite

276
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:38,080
interesting seeing how politics the hell

277
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,730
seems to play a role in people's

278
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,050
assessment of risk

279
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:43,720
I think supply chain risk has always

280
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,460
existed so even if you think about

281
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,170
things like the Novo that tops do you

282
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:49,180
remember you know when the manufacturing

283
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,160
location for those laptops change them a

284
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,350
bit of an outcry at that point we've

285
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:56,410
seen with antivirus with Kaspersky we've

286
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,500
seen it with you know now Hawaii saw the

287
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,080
latest one on the list but I think

288
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,280
what's really important you've got to

289
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,810
know know the risks you're protecting

290
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:07,660
against understand where you might be

291
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,240
vulnerable and then apply the right sort

292
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,190
of approach so I think that's largely

293
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:14,470
the sort of approach the NCSC yes I

294
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:17,320
think that's quite well aligned advice I

295
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,600
kind of think it sucks a bit that

296
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,910
politics gets involved in some of these

297
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,860
discussions because from an information

298
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,540
security practitioners point of view I

299
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,590
think you should just care about the

300
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:30,100
risk and manage it and I you know I

301
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,990
realize that I live in a global world

302
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:35,380
but I also think you know let's just

303
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,150
have a sensible conversation about what

304
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,890
the risks are and figure out on the

305
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,890
right application

306
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:43,000
while we waited but hum along if we go

307
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,240
up right I didn't start I think right

308
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,400
and and it's not a new issue but while

309
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,660
we issue has been ten years in the

310
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,760
making and what's happened is is the

311
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,160
west wit Lodge is gone itself into

312
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,630
position where it's committed and it's

313
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:58,840
put in 3G 4G kit and then you know at

314
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,520
the end of that you know the skews goes

315
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,050
to I said there might be an issue here

316
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,850
and actually everyone's completely

317
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,470
bedded down within it and it's caused

318
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,720
chaos so you know if you look at the

319
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,850
accusations that being leveled by by

320
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,500
Washington around state control

321
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,810
financial support that the theoretic

322
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,700
risk of some kind of national security

323
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,790
issue I mean that could be data in kind

324
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,140
of inception or it could just be

325
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,960
switching stuff off right yeah I'm not

326
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,310
if it's breathing there is no smoking

327
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,160
gun and that's clearly quite ways how

328
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,290
his primary defense but from a West

329
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,360
perspective if Y way was Russian or

330
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,510
North Korean or Iranian we would be

331
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,770
having this debate it had been stripped

332
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,660
out right sure and we're kind of in a

333
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,280
weird gray area with Chinese tech

334
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,260
because everything's made in China so

335
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,030
there's big Chinese organization make it

336
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,610
we're kind of we're fine with it the

337
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:48,070
issue is much broader and and actually

338
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,630
the irony is that the real issue that

339
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,100
we're facing right now is an IOT issue

340
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,020
it's not five years [ __ ] nothing we're

341
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,820
starting to see more discussion around

342
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,040
the vulnerabilities of putting all of

343
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,900
these end connected endpoints into our

344
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,180
homes and offices it's not the network

345
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,490
it's the actual device ins you know I

346
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,500
suspect if you want to trend into 2020

347
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,870
it's going to be scenario scare stories

348
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,550
about IOT vulnerabilities

349
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:12,970
okay then the other thing is we see a

350
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:14,500
trend where politicians are getting

351
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,230
involved and often they might not have

352
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,600
all the knowledge at hand

353
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,030
do you guys would be I like one good

354
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,620
examples Hawaii

355
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:27,600
the other is backdoor for encryption

356
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,630
it's interesting isn't it yeah I mean

357
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:32,770
what do you guys thought some like

358
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,570
politicians starting to get involved in

359
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:37,960
these types of things I think they need

360
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,240
to be advised well boy this will

361
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,190
technical experts around them I think

362
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:43,720
you know I think there's a legitimate

363
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,420
disco so I think I think so the UK Gulf

364
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,570
suggested the ghost user approach which

365
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:52,270
i think is the one that has been posited

366
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,480
in the Home Office debate

367
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,350
in the UK about monitoring social media

368
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:58,490
it is it is

369
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:00,290
sorry monitoring messaging applications

370
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:01,790
that should be a curious about that and

371
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:04,279
it is interesting so clearly you know we

372
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:06,260
do have domestic extremism

373
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,120
do you have terrorist events here in the

374
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,120
UK there is a dialogue about how do you

375
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,760
better get better and detecting those

376
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,860
but it's gotta be I mean you are going

377
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,829
to force it to another another channel

378
00:14:18,829 --> 00:14:20,570
if you sort of say well these channels

379
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:21,889
are the ones that monitored but what

380
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:24,079
about these ones over here that that you

381
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,699
know that are sit outside our

382
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,920
jurisdiction aren't people we lost you

383
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,240
can use gonna shift on that traffic

384
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,010
elsewhere and actually it's not the

385
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:34,610
encryption that gets exploited it's not

386
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:36,230
the encryption that stops it sometimes

387
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,519
it's all really wants to get into that

388
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:38,839
and they're going to use other

389
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:40,670
techniques to get into that conversation

390
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:43,070
so yeah it's a tricky one

391
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:46,180
definitely worth use and debates I think

392
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,380
and it's not an it's not you I mean

393
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,000
Loveland sets been around forever

394
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,240
yeah what we did as business for James

395
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,089
and I overlapped we see now is the fact

396
00:14:56,089 --> 00:14:58,339
that the Northland suffers locked out

397
00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:00,500
and the challenge is that if they find a

398
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,630
way in and that back door is potentially

399
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,130
available to people that you would want

400
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,750
to give it to and that ultimately is the

401
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,069
best defense that the messaging guys

402
00:15:07,069 --> 00:15:09,949
have is if they create any any back

403
00:15:09,949 --> 00:15:11,660
doors of Honor ability it doesn't the

404
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,399
ghost Protocol idea that came out the UK

405
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:15,470
if you put that in then somebody's gonna

406
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:18,350
pick that up in Russia or China Iran of

407
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,329
course sorry

408
00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:23,149
anybody second sorry I I was just gonna

409
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:26,990
say like I you know I get it I get you

410
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,550
know with a lawful order and a core

411
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:32,089
process you know we the company should

412
00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:34,790
be compelled some companies have

413
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,440
architected their solution so that

414
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,560
that's nearly impossible but you know

415
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,540
recently revealed to the world was that

416
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:45,110
telegram had built in some capability

417
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,120
some intercept capability and shut down

418
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,860
you know a pretty massive group of

419
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,190
jihadist

420
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:56,360
Isis members so you know I keep seeing

421
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,610
this oh we need encryption backdoor but

422
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:01,519
then I'm like but law enforcement still

423
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,279
seems to be doing great things and

424
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:07,040
taking down you know child exploitation

425
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,120
and counterfeit property and massive

426
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,570
money laundering there is now a

427
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:16,160
Lamborghini with a pretty cool paint job

428
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,959
for sale as a result of us indictment so

429
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,690
I almost think that you know this is

430
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:25,610
this is a smoke and mirrors game and

431
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,550
this is not you know a real debate well

432
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:33,620
what are your thoughts guys I think I

433
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,259
think there's definitely success in

434
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:38,449
monitoring some of things that people

435
00:16:38,449 --> 00:16:40,220
need to monitor with lawful intercepts

436
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,259
there's no doubt about that and has made

437
00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:46,420
a big impact by I struggle to see the

438
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:49,940
benefit of of getting into those

439
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,690
channels that because you're just going

440
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,430
to push that conversation somewhere else

441
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,259
it's quite interesting about you think

442
00:16:57,259 --> 00:16:59,540
about services like telegram I think the

443
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,790
Russian regulator gets involved in in

444
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:02,569
some of that so you've got other

445
00:17:02,569 --> 00:17:04,760
pressure from other countries getting

446
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,199
involved that now you're into the Intel

447
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:07,790
sharing discussion about who shares

448
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:13,339
until who so yeah I I don't know I'm

449
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:16,730
kind of a bit of a privacy know so I

450
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,230
don't like the idea of breaking

451
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,270
mathematics which is essentially one of

452
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:25,309
these yeah but I can see them I can see

453
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:26,569
the arguments and the owners often as

454
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:30,409
well so it's good to debate and I think

455
00:17:30,409 --> 00:17:33,200
it's you know on balance it's got to be

456
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,690
privacy because the rest of not privacy

457
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:38,540
are simply too great and what's been

458
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,740
really interesting this year as we've

459
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,260
seen an ability handle if you want a hat

460
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,030
what's going on and what's that you had

461
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,710
the iPhone or you have Android device

462
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,470
what's that's clearly what's happened if

463
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:50,390
an agency wants to get in the middle of

464
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,830
a conversation they've just got a hat

465
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,419
one end of that conversation we know

466
00:17:53,419 --> 00:17:55,549
that and that is a sophisticated thing

467
00:17:55,549 --> 00:17:57,919
to do but then it protects you know the

468
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,929
massive of people in terms of excuse if

469
00:17:59,929 --> 00:18:02,390
their own communications because the

470
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:04,040
other thing that I think people don't

471
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,400
realize is if you start playing around

472
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,830
with these things the attackers are just

473
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,710
going to go off and do their own thing

474
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:14,090
haven't we already seen that with some

475
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:17,000
of the assets where they develop their

476
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,100
own clients

477
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,600
yeah hopefully there I've got plenty of

478
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,370
holes in them as well right so they can

479
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:27,980
be exploited yeah exactly right cool

480
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,690
all right guys the last couple of

481
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:32,840
minutes of the the session fascinating

482
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,330
stuff Zach I guess you gave us a little

483
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:36,740
bit of an insight into your thoughts

484
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,289
around the next year probably forever

485
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:41,690
really around IOT risk and all that kind

486
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:45,169
of stuff but just give us an idea James

487
00:18:45,169 --> 00:18:46,850
what you think we might be seeing more

488
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,590
and more on the next 12 months and maybe

489
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:51,320
even beyond I was very interesting on

490
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:55,730
the DevOps discussions on the show yeah

491
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,110
I'm really interested to see how

492
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,720
developing code is changing the way that

493
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,240
companies lose data and the way that

494
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,919
they're vulnerable and I think as a

495
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,570
theme it's a really interesting one

496
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,970
because the way we're producing code is

497
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:09,850
changing we can do it quicker better

498
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:12,049
faster than ever before but it's bought

499
00:19:12,049 --> 00:19:13,880
a whole host of new risks which I think

500
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,799
are interesting for us as professionals

501
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:18,140
to have to manage so I think 2020 for me

502
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,220
is that's gonna be a really interesting

503
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:24,140
area yeah okay yes three buckets all

504
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:28,700
over the place yes remember Shawn s3 is

505
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,649
not vulnerable when you buy it it is

506
00:19:30,649 --> 00:19:33,500
vulnerable when you configure it yeah

507
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:37,039
