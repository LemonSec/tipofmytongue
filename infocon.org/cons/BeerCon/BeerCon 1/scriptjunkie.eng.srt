1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
okay welcome back so scrip junkie good

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,220
evening how are you I'm good how are you

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,059
I'm doing great excellent so do as a

4
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:11,809
favor tell us who you are what you do

5
00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:14,940
definitely so we often find me online

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,650
the script junkie my name is Matt weeks

7
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,529
I am leading a small research and

8
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:22,170
development group at route 9b in the US

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,180
and came from kind of a mix I'm sure a

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,099
lot of people have in the industry have

11
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:31,230
have hit different areas I started off

12
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,130
in the Air Force doing essentially

13
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,210
computer what they call computer network

14
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,370
defense or essentially blue teaming

15
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,670
stuff started to move into I started

16
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,770
with forensics and reverse engineering

17
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,640
move to kind of hunt focus there after a

18
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,789
while that I got out of there and came

19
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:52,500
to route 9 B where I've shifted more

20
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,969
towards the research and development

21
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:57,780
side of things on the side for a long

22
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,399
time especially during the Air Force I

23
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,620
did a lot of open-source tool

24
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,539
development so I'm one of the Metasploit

25
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,400
developers I'm although haven't been

26
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,590
super active lately have written quite a

27
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,619
bit of that and done some of the xsplit

28
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:13,430
developers are as well as core

29
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,479
development there as well

30
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,330
Wow now we're focusing on I'm really a

31
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,530
lot of different aspects of security

32
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,509
definitely trying to hit all new things

33
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:24,180
we do things like application security

34
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,409
assessment try to figure out how to

35
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:27,689
exploit a you know software or maybe in

36
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:31,280
use by one of our clients or other

37
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,960
things like that we also look at how to

38
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,700
yeah operational techniques things like

39
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,310
how to avoid detection how to hide how

40
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,100
to gain access in unusual ways persist

41
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,990
in unusual ways and how to detect those

42
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,700
types of things and then those can be

43
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,540
fed back into root not B's security

44
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,310
offerings to make sure that we can we

45
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,219
can handle that so that's kind of where

46
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:59,100
I've come from I guess a little bit of

47
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,860
background of myself so I'm gonna I'm

48
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,930
gonna drop some docs on script junkie

49
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,719
here because I met him in 2015 and you

50
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,419
will not find someone that is so

51
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,950
humorous as he is he's you got a wicked

52
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,980
humor and it really comes out in like

53
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,770
Twitter and some of the rep partes that

54
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,810
we've had in the past and one of the

55
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,450
reasons I wanted you on this event was

56
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:27,690
because you've got a really kind of cool

57
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,790
perspective on stuff I mean you've seen

58
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:33,030
a lot you've done a lot but I'll tell

59
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,530
you if there's one person that will call

60
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,840
a [ __ ] research I would say it's you

61
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,440
yeah yeah you know I guess I do kind of

62
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,610
enjoy being a little bit of contrarian

63
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,650
and definitely enjoy having fun and

64
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:47,850
that's the other thing with like Twitter

65
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,190
you know I tried to my initial theory

66
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,200
was hey if I have a serious contribution

67
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,840
to the world of information security I'm

68
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,880
going to put an article on my blog or

69
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,080
something like that and then if I have

70
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,910
something in common I'll go ahead and

71
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,640
throw it on Twitter and sure enough that

72
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,110
kind of ended up taking over but but

73
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,600
yeah there's there's a lot a lot of

74
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,250
different ways that I like doing that I

75
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,190
just love finding ways that are doing

76
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,400
things that are what ordinary people

77
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,320
don't do but aren't necessarily

78
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,329
forbidden you know just like any good

79
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:24,690
hacker definitely have a lot of it what

80
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,880
do you think do you think that maybe

81
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:31,320
that is kind of like an area that that

82
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,150
people are trying to take themselves too

83
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,670
seriously that you're seeing you know

84
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:38,190
people getting wrapped around the axle

85
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,470
over you know password' and 'repeat

86
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:45,150
discussion right yeah you know to some

87
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,650
extent and there is there's some of that

88
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm gonna I don't know if you're

89
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,859
directly referencing I just posted

90
00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:53,190
something on that no I was making more

91
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:56,190
fun at Jonathan Decker who who who is a

92
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,650
member of the beer farmers and we have

93
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,180
had some drawn-out fights about

94
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,700
passwords and password managers and all

95
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:11,160
of that right no now I actually did a

96
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,540
little blog post where I just kind of

97
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,310
posted because I saw people talking

98
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,600
about this kind of stuff right posted

99
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,029
basically the script I use which is just

100
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:19,200
like a little power stuff double click

101
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,108
and then it'll generate both a phrase

102
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:25,470
and a password and just talked about

103
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,660
kind of

104
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,820
you know here's the numbers I've used

105
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,650
which is why I'm taking this word listen

106
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,210
this many of words and that kind of

107
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,010
stuff which is basically hey if you look

108
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,620
at you know pick your adversary right

109
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,780
you could pick the hash rate of the

110
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,580
Bitcoin network and you know literally

111
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,699
billions of dollars have gone into this

112
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:49,080
network and the total output of that is

113
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,120
and you can tell how many hashes they

114
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,970
produce per second and so then you say

115
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,840
well okay if I have you know this many

116
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,250
input words you know do the math and you

117
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,389
can figure out how long it would take

118
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:02,430
that to crack it and if that's not going

119
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,690
to crack it then obviously nothing

120
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:04,949
you're gonna face in the real ones can

121
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:05,729
crack me there

122
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:11,190
so what yeah I you know other thing I

123
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,900
don't know if you have like a script

124
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,710
list of questions but I we just wanted

125
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,350
it to be free-flowing and I know that in

126
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,810
20 you backed away a little bit from

127
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,539
social media because he basically you

128
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:25,560
started a family

129
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,350
and now you're sort of like coming back

130
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,510
into it and being a little bit more

131
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:33,840
vocal that time obviously a period of

132
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,660
reflection but how are you seeing sort

133
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,520
of the evolution of cybersecurity

134
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,470
because I mean you started in the Air

135
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,930
Force and now you've gone sort of

136
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:46,410
private sector how are you feeling about

137
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:50,610
the industry as a whole in 2019 right so

138
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:53,729
you know I will say it's it's kind of

139
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:56,539
interesting in in the perspective of

140
00:05:56,539 --> 00:06:01,710
we're starting to get more I obviously

141
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,539
in the past few years there's been more

142
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:05,160
political focus and part of that was a

143
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,199
result of the you know recent

144
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,729
presidential elections and everybody

145
00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:11,310
talking about everybody starting to see

146
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,400
some of the kind of real world impact of

147
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,270
things that have been talked about

148
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,130
before and you're also starting to see a

149
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,470
few both in terms of real world

150
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,330
significance but also I'm you're seeing

151
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,940
ships in terms of you know things that

152
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,680
are happening in the real world

153
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,590
and I wanted to make a point on what is

154
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,300
the fact that supply chain attacks are

155
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,270
really starting to become more and more

156
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,890
popular and and people are really

157
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,780
starting to realize their power and all

158
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,160
that kind of stuff which

159
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,540
that was cool because I did talk on that

160
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:43,040
a few years ago I up code in in Dubai

161
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,900
and so I just kind of went through hey

162
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,820
look you take a look at you know there

163
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,890
have been a few prior to this but

164
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:53,610
there's kind of a lot of the impression

165
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,800
that you'll get sometimes especially if

166
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,300
you talk with like until they didn't see

167
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,250
you guys at that point in time was that

168
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,400
oh well this is like you know a top-tier

169
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,750
nation-state apt technique is to get

170
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,520
into somebody's supply chain and they're

171
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,920
talking about you know well you can

172
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,570
imagine doing trust chips from China or

173
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,950
something well it's not something you

174
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,230
would expect an ordinary guy to do you

175
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:16,410
know fast forward you know a little

176
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:19,710
while and and you know my my point then

177
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,540
was hey look you have all of you know

178
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,730
everybody's shifting to these newer

179
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:26,450
programming paradigms where instead of

180
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:29,820
you know using a few libraries manually

181
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,380
compiling them all the kind of stuff you

182
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,970
just have these package managers and

183
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:37,320
that's the case for Python Ruby go Russ

184
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,020
you know it's kind of stuff and anybody

185
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,840
can post to this stuff and you can

186
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,850
install it and run it in just a single

187
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:48,930
command and it's and so people are using

188
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:52,110
a whole lot more components from unknown

189
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,750
sources and they're just you know kind

190
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,430
of searching for them and using it and

191
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:59,610
it's making your development cycles far

192
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:02,250
faster and more productive so you're

193
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,960
able to do all kinds of cool things but

194
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,990
it had the the fertile ground of

195
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,360
security attack can't really come out

196
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,480
then and so what I did was I ran through

197
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,480
a bunch of these scenarios and just went

198
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,300
ahead and since at that point I hadn't

199
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,860
seen anybody else doing them except for

200
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,840
there was one Python thing that people

201
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,550
were talking about and so I just went

202
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,530
ahead and started putting up packages I

203
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:28,620
put up a package that was but I think

204
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,230
three typo'd so it was it was the same

205
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:35,429
name as as three separate a very popular

206
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:37,080
some of the most popular Python packages

207
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,179
in the world with one letter slightly

208
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:42,240
different right okay easy typo and I got

209
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,020
hundreds and hundreds of installs from

210
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,210
all over you know and I didn't do

211
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,740
anything malicious obviously because I'm

212
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,520
not going to

213
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,800
you didn't want to build a botnet either

214
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,510
I don't want to go president right Yeah

215
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,160
right I don't want to go to prison and I

216
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,570
don't live in Russia so I can't just

217
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,630
cash out and all right you know the

218
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:03,660
middle of trafficking I love that

219
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,220
splinter pattern that he had on that

220
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,310
Lamborghini though come on it's pretty

221
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:11,100
cool if so going to your point speaking

222
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:16,500
see point about third part compromise we

223
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,810
talked earlier with Lori who does upset

224
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:21,840
about the things that keep you awake at

225
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,070
night and the things that keep me awake

226
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:28,770
our upstream third by compromise so when

227
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,370
we go a look back in recent history

228
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:35,610
we'll go back to I think 2017 when

229
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:39,000
browsealoud was compromised by Manette

230
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,660
coin hive and that apparently I think

231
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,460
infected about four and a half thousand

232
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,700
UK websites that's right yeah including

233
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,680
the Information Commissioner's Office

234
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,850
yes the antivirus lawmen exactly right

235
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:00,750
and that was a innocuous Safe Browsing

236
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:06,930
kind of designed around people browsing

237
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:09,180
a website that had various different

238
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,340
impairments but it had Manero

239
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,380
coin mining going on and then you look

240
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,970
more recently here British as

241
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,680
value-added right there

242
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,320
well then he look recently at British

243
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:19,740
Airways

244
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,550
who 20:18 got compromised by a mage

245
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:28,320
count and that led to them losing and

246
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,360
this is later this is two lines of

247
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,160
JavaScript which is definitely

248
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,190
horrifying the way ours to look at this

249
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:38,400
right and I've asked people given a talk

250
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,680
honestly exact thing if would you go to

251
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,540
any person around a personalized sheet

252
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,360
and say hey here's a text editor can you

253
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,170
edit the code and would you allow anyone

254
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,120
on the street to put in some random code

255
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,220
into your system everyone will don't

256
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,920
know well how is allowed be any

257
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,470
different to that yeah you literally

258
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,560
including someone's code in your system

259
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,360
so script F key do you have any

260
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,420
recommendation

261
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,010
of how people could prevent something

262
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:11,490
like this I will try reduce the risk

263
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:14,050
right and so for each one there's

264
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:16,060
there's different you know ways you can

265
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,149
do that obviously be extremely careful

266
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:20,320
for some of the things that I was doing

267
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,699
obviously be extremely careful that

268
00:11:21,699 --> 00:11:23,740
you're typing it in their correct away

269
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:28,120
another thing that people do especially

270
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,350
a lot of these as they set up something

271
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,760
like a virtual environment or something

272
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,300
like that you know you can depending on

273
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:34,990
what you're doing

274
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,420
I obviously the best thing you can do is

275
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,220
to you know go line by line through your

276
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,750
dependencies and make sure there's

277
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,399
nothing malicious in that we also have

278
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,070
to be very clear that you're doing down

279
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,630
the dependency that which is actually

280
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,190
getting downloaded and run and there

281
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,690
ways to do that which is not necessarily

282
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:50,889
the contents of the github repository

283
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:53,110
that they say is the dependency right

284
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,990
and so that's kind of the top tier not

285
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,329
everybody can do that honestly the best

286
00:11:58,329 --> 00:12:01,990
thing that you can do which is kind of a

287
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,899
generic advice is to minimize your tax

288
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:06,519
service by simply minimizing the number

289
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:08,050
of dependencies that you're introducing

290
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:09,940
do you really need to add a dependency

291
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,709
to the left pad for example every was

292
00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:15,820
familiar with that compromise and and

293
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,920
the other thing is if you are publishing

294
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,110
these types of packages you might want

295
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:23,470
to take some effort to kind of insulate

296
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:26,440
yourself a lot of these and obviously if

297
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,089
you did want to go to that next step you

298
00:12:28,089 --> 00:12:29,829
know across the across the red line and

299
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:33,430
and go even further is that these make

300
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:37,180
it kind of shockingly easy to figure out

301
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,709
you know every one of these packages

302
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:41,199
they love touting their own stats hey

303
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:42,550
look this package was down with a

304
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,199
hundred million times you know Ruby

305
00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:45,100
would do that all the time

306
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,899
and so you're like oh all I have to do

307
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,550
is compromise who runs this package to

308
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,140
get run that many times then you go to

309
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,819
the package and would tell you here are

310
00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:53,860
all of the developers of this package so

311
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,569
you know immediately every single person

312
00:12:55,569 --> 00:12:57,610
there who has rights to push that

313
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,610
package and then it would give you like

314
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:01,990
they're contacting me like you could

315
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,029
email any one of them I'm just thinking

316
00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:06,519
you know this is like there's a there's

317
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:10,269
a perfect fit cost benefit there right

318
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:11,889
you kind of do want to get your name out

319
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:12,910
there simply further than the

320
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,470
perspective of you want to get credit

321
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,220
for your work

322
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,889
be able to you know collect that race or

323
00:13:17,889 --> 00:13:20,560
whatever but at the same time maybe the

324
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,620
the one that you put out there is kind

325
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:27,490
of a professional you know email and

326
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:30,850
maybe that's not the one that maybe you

327
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,379
treat that one a little bit with a

328
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:34,060
little bit more suspicion knowing that

329
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,040
hey it could be done there another thing

330
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,509
you can do is a lot of these have they

331
00:13:40,509 --> 00:13:42,310
have their kind of default method which

332
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,470
any of these developers if they did get

333
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,209
compromised they just have a key

334
00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:48,910
basically stored on a static location

335
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,100
which can then be used to push packages

336
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,110
oftentimes you can find some advanced

337
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:55,660
setting which will force a two-factor

338
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,029
authentication or at least a unique

339
00:13:58,029 --> 00:13:59,230
password which isn't stored on your

340
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,089
system every time you want to publish a

341
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:03,699
new package so there's there's things

342
00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:05,709
that you can have that you can do from

343
00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:09,519
the from the that end as well from the

344
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,620
provider end and then kind of the last

345
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,569
one is just like don't use the are

346
00:14:13,569 --> 00:14:17,980
packaged libraries because they if you

347
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,259
saw opera I basically by sending an

348
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:21,910
email and I did this to Debian - by the

349
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,829
way just basically set up a server which

350
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:25,389
was sitting off a wireless network in my

351
00:14:25,389 --> 00:14:28,209
upstairs bedroom just an old very old

352
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:30,370
gaming box and I said hey can I be

353
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,199
I did the get mirror and everything I

354
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:34,809
said hey can I be a CD mirror and they

355
00:14:34,809 --> 00:14:36,790
said sure and I sent it from script

356
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,529
junkie looks like this is a total hacker

357
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:39,879
domain like you could have looked up

358
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,620
there me like all I'm doing is hacking

359
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,379
stuff sure so I'm I'm the official I was

360
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:46,480
on the official Debian mirror

361
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,980
distribution so people just click the

362
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,500
link to download the ISOs no you could

363
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,899
download the ISOs and then if you wanted

364
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:55,029
to you could check the md5 sha-1 etc

365
00:14:55,029 --> 00:14:56,949
against the hash file but the hash file

366
00:14:56,949 --> 00:15:00,269
is also stored on the mirror right

367
00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:02,500
against the signature file which signed

368
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,819
the hash file and then you'd have to

369
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,079
check the signature file against the

370
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:07,240
write signature and the beauty of

371
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,490
actually running the mirror myself for a

372
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,230
few months there was that I have the

373
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:13,269
access logs and I can tell you nobody

374
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:16,079
checks the hash file a signature

375
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,370
everyone just downloads the iso in a way

376
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:19,930
they go right of course that could be

377
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,339
whatever I wanted to put on there so

378
00:15:21,339 --> 00:15:22,480
that's obviously you know if you're

379
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,889
talking about getting those types of

380
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:26,139
packages definitely from from one of the

381
00:15:26,139 --> 00:15:28,540
old-school distribution methods

382
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,100
take the effort to do the hash check and

383
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,150
make sure the hash is coming from

384
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:33,190
trusted location oftentimes you can find

385
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:35,260
it on the secure location and then our

386
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,030
was the our was the best or worse

387
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:39,190
depending on which hat you want to put

388
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,710
on today because I basically did the

389
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,390
same thing send them an email said hey I

390
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:47,380
like to host a mirror and set it up and

391
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,360
they have per country mirrors and the

392
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,580
idea was as long as you are from a

393
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,900
location which doesn't have a mirror

394
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,450
sure and then anytime somebody installs

395
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:56,920
a package they'll get that mirror list

396
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,080
and it'll be your you know name with

397
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,790
that country there and so if you wanted

398
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,440
to set one like there were none in you

399
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,760
know all kinds of countries I can think

400
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,110
of really interesting from the

401
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,910
perspective like Iran and all these

402
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,640
other kinds of things you could just set

403
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,740
up one and the beauty of the our package

404
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,900
system was that signatures are not

405
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,330
checked there's a hash list inside with

406
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:19,660
md5 to verify simply that a package has

407
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,710
not been tampered with

408
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,450
but the MD fives are part of the package

409
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,620
and so if you wanted to do something

410
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,890
malicious there's no external sign or

411
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,540
anything else checked by that and so

412
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,120
basically I was getting literally tens

413
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,490
of thousands of downloads of packages

414
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:36,640
every day that I had that mirror up and

415
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,560
any single one of those I could have put

416
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,980
something malicious in and just just

417
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,570
massive amounts of stuff and a lot of

418
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,040
people think well okay but that's our

419
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,780
yeah but you have to realize what art is

420
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:50,020
art is the premier you know most

421
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,690
commonly used data analysis engine so if

422
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:54,340
you want to get the data mm-hm

423
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:58,810
that's go go for the data right Gary and

424
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:02,740
and has anything been done about this so

425
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,900
a few I've noticed I haven't gone back

426
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,599
to our I know for like Python like they

427
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,750
used to like how I did like I went

428
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:14,079
through tour set up a burn email through

429
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,940
it in my registration they never even

430
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,910
checked my email and then went ahead and

431
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,890
uploaded all this kind of stuff some I

432
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,960
know Python Italy's last I checked had

433
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,000
started verifying those emails and

434
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,380
there's been kind of a lot of discussion

435
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,690
on some of the developer some of the

436
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,190
threads on a lot of the package managers

437
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:33,370
in terms of hey what can you what can we

438
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:36,430
do against this and I don't know if a

439
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,930
lot of them just don't have a great way

440
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:41,410
of addressing this and so they're kind

441
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:41,860
of

442
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,750
tough but some of them are adding the

443
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,340
capability of doing things like signing

444
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,320
packages and so there's there's some

445
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,820
progress but when you're holy just us I

446
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,470
mean it's the it's the base protocol

447
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,750
right you know it's yeah it'll take a

448
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,039
lot of work it's not just pressing the

449
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:56,980
blog I've looked at most of the popular

450
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,289
package managers in the last few months

451
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:02,289
and none of them are doing anything

452
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,390
likes I mean verification or anything

453
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,909
like that by default some of them are

454
00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:08,559
right about it but they don't you buddy

455
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:09,039
fault

456
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,950
right yeah and out like ruby has that as

457
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,899
an option but then none of the top ten

458
00:18:13,899 --> 00:18:15,549
packages were using it so it was pretty

459
00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:19,990
easy to just and even yeah lots of ways

460
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:22,480
of of just doing that but evening the

461
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,460
application most people are doing the

462
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:28,769
CSP no most people aren't doing in fact

463
00:18:28,769 --> 00:18:32,019
some people are doing CSP which is great

464
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:35,860
but nobody is doing s RI so we're not

465
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,960
seeing much use of some resorts

466
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,860
integrity right so people aren't hashing

467
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:45,460
the the upstream code that they're

468
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,889
consuming in their applications listen

469
00:18:47,889 --> 00:18:51,330
the script junkie we are done ma yeah

470
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,610
it's been really good really it's great

471
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,740
to touch base with you man and wish you

472
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:01,179
all the best in 2020 brother yeah Thank

473
00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:03,100
You beads are really really interesting

474
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,500
good stuff thanks very much chairman I

475
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,159
do
