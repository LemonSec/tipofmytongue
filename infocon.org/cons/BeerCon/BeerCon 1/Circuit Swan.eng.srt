1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
okay hi now we're joined by Nicole

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,109
Schwartz so hello to go hey glad you

3
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:09,420
guys are still going I kind of shocked

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,650
it's been a very long time so how far

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:19,260
we're beer powered so Nicole welcome a

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,080
bear come one and as it would be very

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,060
nice of you if you wouldn't mind telling

8
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,220
us a bit about who you are and then what

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,150
what is it he do so I do a lot of things

10
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,369
and I'm a very weird person so I'll give

11
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,210
you the high level summary yeah I am now

12
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,629
a person working and get lab in the

13
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:43,649
secured team and I just moved to Canada

14
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:48,210
and I ended up here because way a long

15
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,309
time ago I convinced my mom that we

16
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:53,820
wanted to go to Vegas for DEFCON it

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,370
wasn't even 18 yet and then it all kind

18
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,100
of went from there so that's like the

19
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,800
really short summary of my life and

20
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,530
otherwise I was on the side I work on

21
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,600
the Diana initiative which happens

22
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,049
saying hacker con summer camp week and I

23
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:12,720
also help with the songs I've got an OS

24
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,939
n project that I'm trying to start work

25
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:19,140
on for that and I generally herd cats so

26
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,240
if there's any cat herding to be done oh

27
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,340
my god she's like a way better looking

28
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,850
female version of me that's crazy I

29
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,369
volunteer at Diana initiative a def con

30
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:33,659
was how I got started

31
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:40,799
oh my god we're like sisters okay so

32
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,720
it's gonna be interesting to have my mom

33
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,149
back because were you originally

34
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:57,320
Canadian no well there you go yeah

35
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,500
interesting so you mentioned you working

36
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,619
forget that but it does that mean you

37
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:08,000
involved in development or researching

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,020
what is it you do that

39
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,140
so I'm actually doing product management

40
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:13,900
for

41
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,610
secure testing sweet so ideally doesn't

42
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,730
know what good lab is it's software for

43
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,470
software developers to write software

44
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:26,650
which is only slightly recursive and so

45
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,330
while people are writing their software

46
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,129
would really like them to write it

47
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:33,489
better with less security holes and less

48
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:35,290
bugs because high quality code is

49
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,790
awesome and everyone wants to be proud

50
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,579
of their code so as of right now in our

51
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:41,290
paid tier and we're bringing it down

52
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,560
into our free tier as this free version

53
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,560
we have sassed dashed dependency

54
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,049
scanning container scanning and license

55
00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:52,780
compliance and it lets you know oh there

56
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,970
see bees for this or you know the

57
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,890
possibility of a sequel injection here

58
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,489
and a lot of times that happens way

59
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:02,739
later in the process and so you don't

60
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:04,269
know what developer necessarily

61
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:06,340
introduced the bad thing into your code

62
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,709
whereas since we've run the skins for

63
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:10,750
free and we don't charge like per scan

64
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,220
or anything we're relying on open source

65
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,109
tools you can run it every single time

66
00:03:14,109 --> 00:03:15,970
you add codes you know exactly when it

67
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,760
was introduced and bike home so that's

68
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,400
kind of my mission as I've always been

69
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,959
in software demo but now I'm trying to

70
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,000
make sell for dab a little bit better

71
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,250
for everyone

72
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,919
Wow it's just it was so impactful

73
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:33,579
because I know that was it was get labs

74
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:36,549
that introduced the idea of scanning the

75
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,940
repositories the repos for software

76
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,849
vulnerability right and we didn't start

77
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:45,099
with that about yeah a bit over a year

78
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,959
ago with gymnasium we purchased that

79
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:47,680
yeah yeah

80
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,870
and then Microsoft are throwing money at

81
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,329
the problem and acquiring people so also

82
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:54,989
does that now but we did it first

83
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:58,090
awesome that's that's such a powerful

84
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:01,379
way to impact security at like really a

85
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:04,379
developer friendly level you know

86
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:07,060
probably a lot more constructive than

87
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,319
posting your homework to Stack Overflow

88
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,030
I've heard that that isn't a pleasant

89
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:18,039
experience so at the software

90
00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:20,769
development level then is there like a

91
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:22,599
obviously you have to pay attention to

92
00:04:22,599 --> 00:04:24,820
what's happening in terms of disclosure

93
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,380
right what are some of the sort

94
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,490
inputs that you guys use is it like a

95
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,680
threat intelligence feed is it feedback

96
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,870
from the developer community like how do

97
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:39,070
you identify something bad in quotations

98
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,140
so as of right now a majority of our

99
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,630
scanners are looking for rather

100
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,240
simplistic things is this applicable to

101
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,400
cross-site scripting or whatever and

102
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,110
then they're also checking against a CBE

103
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,980
list and we're using an VM and a couple

104
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,020
other sources which are all listed if

105
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,570
you go to our public vulnerability

106
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,700
database project you can see exactly

107
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,680
what sources were aggregating from and

108
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,230
we do take community contributions and

109
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:09,050
so our vulnerability database anyone can

110
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,420
go look at it anyone can see what we've

111
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,370
got in there anyone could add something

112
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,830
obviously we need to approve it right

113
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,050
before it gets accepted but we do take

114
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,210
community contributions at this point

115
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,190
nobody in the community has done it

116
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,570
we've had you know obviously some

117
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,970
internal employees add some stuff but

118
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:28,490
we're hoping over time more people will

119
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,740
add it especially because fingers cross

120
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,800
we're discussing becoming a CNA so that

121
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,770
we can accept vulnerabilities related to

122
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:41,480
project hosted that's awesome so I mean

123
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,220
you've got all these two leading them

124
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,620
and that they're so what are sort of

125
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,420
some of the challenges that you see

126
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,750
teams or teams face today especially

127
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:55,100
around developing and security so the

128
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,780
talk that I've been giving for this

129
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,000
whole past year probably summarizes down

130
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,270
to two points we don't educate

131
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:07,490
developers well about security so even

132
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,350
if they want to care about it we don't

133
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,000
give them the tools to understand what

134
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,280
they can do to change anything and then

135
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,740
the second part is security teams and a

136
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,990
lot of cases and if you followed InfoSec

137
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,940
Sherpa on Twitter she shouts about this

138
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,520
a lot we don't have empathy for the rest

139
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,560
of the business units and what they're

140
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,460
expected to do and so I think if we can

141
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,710
get some empathy for the teams that are

142
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,810
having to do security and then get them

143
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,180
the education they need nobody wants to

144
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,800
be the person who gets the company

145
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,510
breach they just usually don't up the

146
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,250
tools to understand how do I stop it

147
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:40,729
like I

148
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:42,469
understand sequel injections bad but

149
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:46,159
what is sequel injection you know yeah

150
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:47,689
yeah I know it's bad but what is it and

151
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:49,789
how did I introduce it now do I fix it

152
00:06:49,789 --> 00:06:51,680
and it's interesting because you know

153
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,719
that comes back and then the easiest

154
00:06:53,719 --> 00:06:56,539
route that devs frequently take is to

155
00:06:56,539 --> 00:06:59,689
add filters soon realizing that filters

156
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:02,180
don't work at scale and parameterised

157
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,879
input is the way to go but then you have

158
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:06,620
to rewrite the entire application that's

159
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,719
a very simplistic view and I'm using a

160
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:10,309
lot of words that I don't quite

161
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:12,589
understand but I just wanted to show off

162
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:16,300
a little bit because I'm good okay

163
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:20,300
so flipping that around it's all very

164
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,039
well saying hey you're gonna reach out

165
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:24,020
to teams and there that's only gonna

166
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,669
work if those teams are willing to

167
00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:27,649
engage what what advice can you give

168
00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:30,620
when you find that teams are just not

169
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,860
interested for whatever reason you just

170
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,199
effectively meet a brick wall how do you

171
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:37,729
break that wall down and you get them

172
00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:40,520
invested and engaged and working with

173
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,659
the security teams I think unfortunately

174
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:46,039
if you've gotten somewhere where there's

175
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:48,020
already a bad relationship you need to

176
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,629
start really slow and I know that drives

177
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:53,469
some people crazy but just starting with

178
00:07:53,469 --> 00:07:56,990
having coming over with bagels Donuts

179
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:59,629
fruit trays whatever some food and just

180
00:07:59,629 --> 00:08:02,620
asking you know how exactly does

181
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,669
software development work in your

182
00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:06,409
department just tell me about what your

183
00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:09,709
normal workflow is and understanding how

184
00:08:09,709 --> 00:08:12,499
they work as a starting point and then

185
00:08:12,499 --> 00:08:14,240
bribing them with food because everyone

186
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,099
likes food at least most people like

187
00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:18,379
food and just starting to get friendly

188
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:20,240
so they feel like they can you know tell

189
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,059
you about things so don't start trying

190
00:08:23,059 --> 00:08:24,439
to force anything on them just find out

191
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:26,479
exactly how they work and what problems

192
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,089
they experience and find out if some of

193
00:08:29,089 --> 00:08:30,620
the security controls you have in place

194
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,049
or places that they're getting caught up

195
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:35,779
and see if that gives you any win so for

196
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:37,429
example maybe right now they're trying

197
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:40,130
to login to a bunch of different places

198
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,589
and they have to remember all of those

199
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:44,329
passwords and then they're told we can't

200
00:08:44,329 --> 00:08:45,589
write the past it's down yeah oh yeah

201
00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:48,170
yeah that well what if I mean as a

202
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,370
security company

203
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,830
you loved it if everyone

204
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,290
using a class pass or okhta or you know

205
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,210
what a password or something anyway so

206
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:57,790
can you start being like oh well what if

207
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,440
we get the company on board with doing

208
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,180
this this would help you have less

209
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,210
logins or the day and just find things

210
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,030
where they have a pain point that you

211
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:09,250
can make more secure and better for them

212
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,020
because once they start seeing that

213
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,340
you're working with them you can start

214
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,890
being like okay and the other teams are

215
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:18,040
starting to do a ghast skin in their dev

216
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,080
environment I see that you already have

217
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,930
a test server up and you already run

218
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,570
some automated regression can I run some

219
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,160
tasks and I will make you do anything

220
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,630
with the results to start I just want to

221
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,760
see where we are and compare that to

222
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,040
production but are you talking then

223
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,020
about a big investment in things like

224
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,900
sonar Kiev and checkmarks or there are

225
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,630
tons of free scanners out there they're

226
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:43,090
not necessarily as fully featured or

227
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:46,180
robust but why start with the expensive

228
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,700
solution until you've gotta buy it it's

229
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,100
totally cool yeah that's that's that's

230
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,480
great advice so a personal plug yo cuz

231
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,370
chapter leader go look at all us they

232
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:59,890
are so many tools out there and some of

233
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,150
the tools are bringing out now are

234
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:06,760
fantastic oh yeah is great that there's

235
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,890
defect order that we even looked at that

236
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:11,860
looks absolutely amazing and then

237
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,310
they'll actually I mean you've got the

238
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,780
community edition do you want to maybe

239
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:20,710
give a bit more about that so our

240
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,990
community edition is free for everyone

241
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,970
to use and we try and rely on a lot of

242
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:27,010
open-source tools which is why I was

243
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,180
saying earlier that a lot of our

244
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,620
security skins are going to come down

245
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,960
into the community edition because they

246
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,380
are based on some of the OAuth tools and

247
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,540
some of the other open-source security

248
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,970
scanning tools that are out there and so

249
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,260
now that we've kind of worked at the

250
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,820
bugs and we've got it working and we

251
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,430
think it can scale there's no reason why

252
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,930
we can't take all the open-source tools

253
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,910
that we have and are using and put that

254
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,560
into Community Edition it just doesn't

255
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,680
make sense to not do that and so the

256
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,600
great thing this is the only company

257
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,740
I've worked at where people actually

258
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,390
come up to me when I'm working a booth

259
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,370
at an event and say like I love your

260
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:03,100
product you're amazing

261
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,450
that worked out usually they come up and

262
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:07,330
they're like either who are you or you

263
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:08,950
know oh I have this problem and no one's

264
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,470
responding to me but yeah generally the

265
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,730
community because it's open source

266
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:15,420
they're like oh I love you and listen

267
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,620
sometimes they get into a crew fluffle

268
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:21,390
with us but we try to listen

269
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,310
sorry it's good we're gonna have to wrap

270
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:27,520
oh okay the reason is that we are we've

271
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,820
