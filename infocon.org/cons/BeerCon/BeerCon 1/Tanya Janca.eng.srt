7
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,490

8
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,550
weather in Canada yeah well not where I

9
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,740
am I'm in like the cheater part of

10
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,929
Canada this beautiful island just above

11
00:00:32,929 --> 00:00:35,600
Seattle and so we don't have snow and

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,479
the rest of Canada is booing me it's

13
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:40,489
like near White Rock right like that

14
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:44,929
that yeah exactly and we joke that we

15
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:52,690
are Canada's Hawaii do you like rain I

16
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:58,459
happen to know that we were polish when

17
00:00:58,459 --> 00:01:00,829
we'd be pronouncing your surname Yan sir

18
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:16,880
yes that was my knowledge minutes listen

19
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,450
Tanya please do us a favor and introduce

20
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,729
yourself tell us who you are and what

21
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:27,170
you do so my name is Tanya Jenkin

22
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,530
and sometimes called she hacks purple

23
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:34,399
because I am a purple Timur so I was a

24
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:37,310
software developer who met a hacker and

25
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,990
that hacker convinced me to learn about

26
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,780
security and then the more I learned you

27
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,539
know the more interested I got and I

28
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:46,999
ended up discovering the I sort of like

29
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:49,700
to do blue team which is defense they

30
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,289
like you know working with software

31
00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:53,390
developers and helping them write more

32
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,759
secure code like teaching them about the

33
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,009
cloud and how to do things more securely

34
00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:00,409
but then I also still really like

35
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:03,049
breaking stuff and that's red team where

36
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:04,999
you attack things it's still really fun

37
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:07,880
to smash stuff and so because of that

38
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,169
people in

39
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,780
to me that means I'm purple team which

40
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,400
is you know kind of the application

41
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,580
security field where you know you do

42
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,050
threat modeling figuring out all your

43
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,640
attacks but then you know you work with

44
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,550
everyone to ensure that everything you

45
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,870
know you have these big hardened

46
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,660
defenses and layers of defenses and your

47
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,140
app is really strong so hence she hacks

48
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,020
purple and do all sorts of things

49
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,000
sometimes it's hard to explain all the

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,360
things that I'm doing but I do a lot of

51
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,350
community stuff because it is well it

52
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:46,170
makes me really happy helping others

53
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,190
makes me happy

54
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,319
other people teach me things I teach

55
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,890
them things and the InfoSec community

56
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:55,709
since I joined if like a few years ago I

57
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:57,480
can't believe how welcoming they are

58
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,670
there's a couple people that are jerks

59
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,830
as with every single group of humans

60
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:04,260
ever but mostly everyone is just like

61
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,569
we're so glad you're here Tania thanks

62
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:07,350
for coming

63
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:11,000
how many of them are beer farmer members

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,980
100 percent of beer farmer members have

65
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,700
been wonderful okay that's a little

66
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,690
Chuck and also all of the many hats bub

67
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:26,700
wonderful good good yeah so I had been

68
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,709
running this thing the past year called

69
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:33,120
mentoring Monday and it's an online

70
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,660
basically people so I read a blog and I

71
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,150
speak at conferences and I like to do

72
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,769
research and then share it on the

73
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:44,070
internet and people would write me and

74
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,079
they would say hey will you be my mentor

75
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:48,840
and I would say no I can't because I'm

76
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,700
already mentoring some people and if I

77
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,410
take out more people then I will have no

78
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:56,010
time for any of them and I'm already I'm

79
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:57,569
a perfectionist and feel like I'm a

80
00:03:57,569 --> 00:03:59,190
crappy mentor because I never feel like

81
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,769
I'm giving my mentees enough time so I'm

82
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:03,239
sorry I can't and then they'd be really

83
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:07,290
sad so then I know and then I felt so

84
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,760
bad and like some of them I'm like

85
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,340
you're just so awesome do you know what

86
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,590
I mean

87
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:17,089
Oh want to find them someone so then I

88
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:19,370
started this hashtag called mentoring

89
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:22,100
Monday and so every Monday I tweet you

90
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,400
know are you looking for a mentor or did

91
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,580
you want to be a mentor you know are you

92
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,350
the senior person with this wealth of

93
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:33,530
knowledge that wants to contribute back

94
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,570
to our industry and move our industry

95
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,630
forward by bringing you know someone

96
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,760
from a junior to an intermediate or

97
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,040
someone from outside InfoSec into

98
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,450
InfoSec and the community has responded

99
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:51,620
so strongly it's so amazing people are

100
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,479
reaching out to people suggesting books

101
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:56,600
meeting with them etc and so every

102
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,160
Monday I do this and more and more

103
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,030
people are responding and so realized

104
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,620
recently though that if people don't

105
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:07,090
follow me they might not see it read it

106
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:10,789
so I put this and put this poll on

107
00:05:10,789 --> 00:05:14,270
Twitter and I was like hey everyone you

108
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:17,650
know should I make it its own handle or

109
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,720
should I keep it under me and then

110
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,310
everyone responded you know you should

111
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,620
keep it under you and then of course I

112
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,930
decided not to listen of course not

113
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,460
because that's a beautiful thing about

114
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:32,330
Twitter well I thought about it more and

115
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,810
more and more and I wanted to outgrow me

116
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,360
if that makes sense so I can retweet it

117
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,490
every Monday so everyone that follows me

118
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:43,700
gets it but if it has its own handle so

119
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,389
for instance like let's say someone is

120
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:48,410
really really really into reverse

121
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:50,630
engineering I basically never talked

122
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,910
about that because I'm not very good at

123
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,250
it and it's not my area of expertise and

124
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,560
so if someone's really into Hearst

125
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,750
engineering they may not want to follow

126
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,030
me and see you know all of my other

127
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,729
posts every other every other day of the

128
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:07,190
week just so that they can see potential

129
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,620
mentoring opportunities so if it's a

130
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,090
separate account then they could just

131
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:13,550
follow that one and then I can still

132
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:16,039
retweet every single thing it does so it

133
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:17,810
everyone that follows me can still see

134
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,990
it it's not lost but maybe it could

135
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,300
eventually become huge and so and this

136
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,990
wonderful human named

137
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,630
Elias offered to help me so if other

138
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:30,840
people want to help with it because you

139
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,850
know the the whoa sec tweets account so

140
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,820
chloe was on earlier and she was talking

141
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,310
about low sec women of security so i

142
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,290
have help with that twitter account too

143
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:43,200
so it used to just be me and i just

144
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,150
wanted to like retweet nice things about

145
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:49,440
women okay because it just makes me

146
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,510
happy to just tweet like congratulations

147
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,720
and like that's so awesome a good job

148
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,670
and i felt like if i just did that only

149
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:59,790
from my account that's supposed to be

150
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,920
about apps tech all the time that it

151
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,630
would be an even and so i made its own

152
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:09,600
account for women of security but also

153
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,570
just just like just tweeting nice things

154
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,190
that women because i feel like there's

155
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,530
like people doing the opposite of that

156
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:20,130
and then maybe it would be okay if I had

157
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,110
just say nice things to people because

158
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,430
it makes me happy and it seems to make

159
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,950
them happy and it's win-win right yeah

160
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,710
yeah and so then that account has like

161
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,270
grown and there's tons and tons of

162
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,400
followers that it has that don't follow

163
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,250
me and that's awesome

164
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,900
do you know what I mean like it's kind

165
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,430
of awesome to see something that you

166
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,140
created and then so I have all these

167
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,090
other women helping me run it so I have

168
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:45,210
to the answer all the messages and a

169
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,920
bunch of us that all just retweet like

170
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,440
if you see anything cool that a woman in

171
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,110
security is doing you know just retweet

172
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,640
it from our account so everyone can see

173
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,810
and we can amplify her and really yeah

174
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,210
yeah and and so the account can outgrow

175
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,580
me even though it has less followers the

176
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,500
followers that it has are people that

177
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,480
really really like that and really want

178
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,780
to see that and so does that make sense

179
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,970
like in regards to branding like it's

180
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:15,360
it's I I will say that it doesn't here's

181
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,700
the major thing I know what happens when

182
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,760
Mike tries to comment or put a tweet out

183
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,490
about football correct and his followers

184
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:26,070
go batshit because they're expecting I

185
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,500
don't know application security because

186
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,070
his of his title so I think the idea of

187
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:35,159
more micro targeting in Twitter with

188
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:38,070
what your handle is good I know that

189
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:40,650
try this a similar project where we

190
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,320
randomly accused security researchers of

191
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,290
belonging to strange apt groups and not

192
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,960
nice and well that wasn't quite as

193
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,600
popular today how much talk just for fun

194
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,970
just for fun yeah so please tell us that

195
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,110
you're not trying to replace yourself

196
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:04,770
with a bot in 29 no no no no definitely

197
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:12,480
not no also be very Tweety so yeah we we

198
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,640
we are actually using the very platform

199
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,020
that I was going to suggest that you

200
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,560
reach out to so stood cybersex dude has

201
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,330
done a tremendous job and there's a lot

202
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,070
of things going on behind the scenes

203
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:26,490
especially with students yes and that so

204
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,950
my recommendation is if you need

205
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:32,040
advancement cybersex Jews are a great

resource he's done a significant amount

207
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,420
of work on this type of thing so it's

208
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,740
just a suggestion

thank you that's really helpful

211
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,450
that's us that we're farmers healthy

212
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,420
yeah that's what we have it's a yeah I'd

213
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,530
like to ask you a question about

214
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,890
application security okay all right so

215
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,510
I'm gonna bring it down the boring level

216
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:58,650
now I do apologize but so you're a next

217
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:01,170
software developer yes and you met

218
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,330
somebody that did security in your own

219
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,340
words and then you became interested

220
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,940
interested and involved in security

221
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,920
mm-hmm so let's assume the application

222
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,230
security is your camera is where your

223
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,830
heart is originally yes tell us what you

224
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:20,190
think about the current app sec

225
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,320
landscape and the things that we've got

226
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,450
to worry about maybe in the next year

227
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:27,030
couple years three five years what do

228
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:30,450
you think I think that we have a lot to

229
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:33,300
worry about unfortunately I am really

230
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:38,400
not concerned about job security we hit

231
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:46,170
a lot so so if you think so one we still

232
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:50,600
aren't very good at the old types of

233
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,480
vacation security so we still see

234
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,600
cross-site scripting in most apps we

235
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,130
still see you know like things that we

236
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:03,079
shouldn't see any more that Oh wasp has

237
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:07,250
been harping on forever and the other

238
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,589
thing is that we are moving forward so

239
00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:13,069
IT is moving forward but a sec is like I

240
00:11:13,069 --> 00:11:16,660
don't know how I feel about that so

241
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,130
things like you know people are moving

242
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:20,180
to the cloud

243
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,430
well apps live in the cloud so we have

244
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,319
to figure out how to do security there

245
00:11:24,319 --> 00:11:27,589
your single page apps so none of the

246
00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:29,930
apps tech tools work for the dam on that

247
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:36,130
like they see things like for instance

248
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:40,100
like serverless apps where they they

249
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,949
just appear for a microsecond or a few

250
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:45,110
seconds or a few minutes per month or

251
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:48,649
per year or whatever people can still

252
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:50,990
catch those I know because I've seen

253
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:55,610
them right and and it's cool when you

254
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:57,500
know bounty hunters talk about it on

255
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,029
podcast and how they made this huge

256
00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:00,380
payoff because they caught one and

257
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:04,149
Exploited it but instead I would rather

258
00:12:04,149 --> 00:12:06,620
developers be aware that even if it's

259
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,899
just there for one minute per week that

260
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:11,649
it still needs to be secured because

261
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:14,600
malicious actors are smart - I wish they

262
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,230
weren't but they're really smart so we

263
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,610
have to assume they're really smart

264
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,069
because they keep proving it to be true

265
00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:25,399
and we have to react accordingly and so

266
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:28,970
I feel like we need to do more with

267
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:31,519
education and regards to software

268
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,130
developers and more and regards to like

269
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:37,550
support and giving them tools so that

270
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,560
they can be supportive like all those

271
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,350
soft skills things that IT professionals

272
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:46,459
are not known for being awesome at we

273
00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:49,220
have to as security people I believe we

274
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:52,459
have to like like if there's a hundred

275
00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:54,529
or 200 or 300 software developers and

276
00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:56,509
one app sect person which is often the

277
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:59,959
case when I go consult somewhere you

278
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:02,750
need you can't just work really hard

279
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,000
you have to work smarter and you have to

280
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,700
make you know allies and relationships

281
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,610
and programs and all of those soft

282
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:13,700
skills things that our industry is not

283
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,910
known for being awesome at I'm not

284
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,380
saying that none of us are awesome at it

285
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,970
I'm just saying that as an industry

286
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:22,940
we're not fantastic I think that's a

287
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,460
fair assessment I see that you know I

288
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,910
see that further along folks go and sort

289
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,610
of technical competence it seems to come

290
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:35,960
at a cost of business acumen and what's

291
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,850
interesting is the folks with the most

292
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,430
business acumen tend to work in the

293
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:42,710
softest side of the technical so I'm

294
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:45,950
talking about you know IT PMS or IT

295
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,010
business analysts or even the threat

296
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:51,410
Intel people who obviously are close to

297
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:51,920
my heart

298
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:57,260
mm-hmm it's true sorry Tanya but go back

299
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,110
to you find about the the change in the

300
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,750
paradigm of software delivery yeah back

301
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,090
back while we were all children which in

302
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:10,100
in many years case was about 1962 I'm

303
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,080
just kidding

304
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:15,500
1952 you know you wrote software and

305
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,080
whatever your desired language was or

306
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,850
whatever framework you were you were

307
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,860
working against and then you copied and

308
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:27,020
pasted files onto a web server yeah yeah

309
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,610
and then you started your web server

310
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:31,670
whether it be a is or Apache or whatever

311
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,720
right Apache owned and [ __ ] just worked

312
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,790
so well yeah and then a little bit later

313
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:40,010
on came this concept of continuous

314
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,720
integration and continuous delivery and

315
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,880
so on and so forth and all of a sudden

316
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,430
you popped your software into a build

317
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:49,250
infrastructure and things happened and

318
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,080
and things like team foundation server

319
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,420
emerged and also we have things like

320
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,820
source control and all that kind of [ __ ]

321
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:00,530
and then more recently like right now we

322
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:04,610
have the concepts of containerization of

323
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,860
stuff like you say micro services and

324
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,600
things that just pop up and do a job and

325
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,750
then disappear and all of a sudden the

326
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,810
developer needs to think I hate the term

327
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,319
but full-stack

328
00:15:16,319 --> 00:15:18,669
mm-hmm so they need to begin to think

329
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:20,979
not just about their their runtime

330
00:15:20,979 --> 00:15:22,389
application they need to start thinking

331
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:25,419
about the entire pipeline they start

332
00:15:25,419 --> 00:15:26,769
thinking about building the

333
00:15:26,769 --> 00:15:28,059
infrastructure as part of their

334
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:30,069
deployment and all that kind of stuff

335
00:15:30,069 --> 00:15:32,949
and it starts to take you away from just

336
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:36,399
simple concepts like XSS and like

337
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,199
getting your it had is correct and all

338
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:40,989
that kind of thing into the realm is my

339
00:15:40,989 --> 00:15:43,259
infrastructure secure so am i deploying

340
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:48,339
using a robust TLS configuration mm-hmm

341
00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:50,019
typically in the past would not be a

342
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:52,299
damn problem it would be a sysadmin

343
00:15:52,299 --> 00:15:54,399
problem or an infrastructure build

344
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,679
engineer or something like that but mine

345
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:58,689
I'm gonna harp on one thing and say it's

346
00:15:58,689 --> 00:16:00,939
even lower down the stack than that yeah

347
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:05,109
okay just getting the dev environment to

348
00:16:05,109 --> 00:16:08,349
be either an absolute copy of production

349
00:16:08,349 --> 00:16:11,759
with a sanitized database yep right or

350
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,819
not having a common database for dev and

351
00:16:15,819 --> 00:16:19,989
prod which which you know is out there

352
00:16:19,989 --> 00:16:23,079
and you know a lot of this you know I

353
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:24,879
hate to harp on it but it goes back to

354
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:26,889
architecture it's not really software

355
00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:30,399
development the issue yeah it's it's

356
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,189
sort of the lack of best practice

357
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:35,109
implementation in terms of like

358
00:16:35,109 --> 00:16:38,769
segregation and and all that so you know

359
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:41,769
I think that devs that come into the

360
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:45,249
into the marketplace that can talk about

361
00:16:45,249 --> 00:16:47,009
issues like you talked about

362
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:49,419
containerization source control but also

363
00:16:49,419 --> 00:16:51,249
have a basic understanding of

364
00:16:51,249 --> 00:16:53,919
architecture best practices are going to

365
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:56,979
be really employable Tanna do you want

366
00:16:56,979 --> 00:16:59,259
to dispute that or supportive

367
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:02,559
I really really agree if anything I feel

368
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:05,409
like academia is really far behind and I

369
00:17:05,409 --> 00:17:08,109
know that in most fields they're a

370
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:10,628
little bit behind but when it comes to

371
00:17:10,628 --> 00:17:14,189
IT and specifically as it relates to

372
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:16,869
security and especially the security of

373
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,929
stuff where they're just like it's not

374
00:17:19,929 --> 00:17:22,919
even really applicable and I had a

375
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:25,750
school post secondary school that will

376
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,670
remain unnamed try to

377
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:32,210
recruit me it was almost like a comedian

378
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:35,179
sort of like moment like an IT person

379
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,460
would watch this and then laugh so hard

380
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,299
yes

381
00:17:38,299 --> 00:17:40,250
trying to convince me to develop you

382
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,490
know like a 120 hour course and teach

383
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:46,460
two times a week plus lab time plus

384
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:50,000
marking and and then create this entire

385
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,500
course and then they would own it and he

386
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,210
is offering to pay me four and a half

387
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,970
thousand Canadian dollars which is like

388
00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:00,500
probably two thousand British pounds to

389
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,270
do all of the N eyes like per week and

390
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:04,220
he's like no no I'm like for the whole

391
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,980
thing and it was like that that slave

392
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,950
labor sweet hurt and also I could just I

393
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,900
could just write like if I'm gonna do

394
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,460
that for almost free why wouldn't I just

395
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,809
do it for free and share it with the

396
00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:16,580
whole world why would I allow you to own

397
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,580
that information and the guys like I

398
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,320
have been given the most impossible task

399
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,360
the guy that had this job before me quit

400
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,140
and like no one will come work for me I

401
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:29,510
felt really really bad for him but I

402
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:32,540
told him and I'll do like this small

403
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,100
amount of self-promotion so I'm writing

404
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,590
a book called Alice and Bob learn

405
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:39,799
application security and the idea is

406
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:41,360
going to be that like any software

407
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,120
developer or how a person could pick up

408
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,710
this book and then be like oh my god I

409
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:49,880
get it and Alice and Bob have little

410
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,470
adventures they have their lives and

411
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:54,620
like how things apply to real humans and

412
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,809
so that's why you actually meet the

413
00:18:56,809 --> 00:18:58,700
security header because this bad thing

414
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,100
could happen to Alice or like you know

415
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,309
bob has a pacemaker and you know what if

416
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,980
Bob's pacemaker you know the integrity

417
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:10,940
is incorrect etc right and so it's like

418
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,040
the basic most basic security concepts

419
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,840
like these privilege etc and then like

420
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,490
building up to you know like so you're

421
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,020
building an app like why what do you

422
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,179
care about what do you need to know but

423
00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:22,100
written in more casual language because

424
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:26,330
I'm I suck at textbooks so you say sorry

425
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,940
sure just quickly and so a Canadian book

426
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:33,410
you say a Canadian book yes it's gonna

427
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:35,540
be called Alice and Bob apologized to

428
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:39,190
each other for local file inclusion

429
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:44,059
that's my joke for the day that's that's

430
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:47,918
that's killer you're killing it

431
00:19:50,659 --> 00:19:53,480
while ebooks but basically like I just

432
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,700
so you never make any money when you

433
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,679
write a book like you don't actually get

434
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,649
paid very much but you rate it because

435
00:20:00,649 --> 00:20:02,779
you want it to exist because I want to

436
00:20:02,779 --> 00:20:04,730
be able to hand it to all the people

437
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,710
that I consult for and say please share

438
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:10,059
this with your software developers

439
00:20:10,059 --> 00:20:14,260
yeah the core joke with it whenever I

440
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:18,289
just cry to you so one of the things

441
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:20,269
I've seen developers have zero knowledge

442
00:20:20,269 --> 00:20:22,789
of anything security and they can go

443
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:24,409
through an entire course university

444
00:20:24,409 --> 00:20:28,700
career do you think those courses should

445
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,070
have security baked into them I think I

446
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,809
already know the answer but what I think

447
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:35,539
companies should have some sort of gates

448
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:37,880
that hey you haven't had this so you

449
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,240
must go in this training ok so yes I

450
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,580
absolutely believe that it's sporter

451
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:46,100
line criminal the academia feels that

452
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,870
they have the right to teach someone to

453
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:50,179
create things and not how to make sure

454
00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:51,710
those things that they create are safe

455
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,279
like if a trade school taught

456
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:57,649
electricians how to do electrical but

457
00:20:57,649 --> 00:20:59,330
then not how to ensure that the

458
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:00,980
electrical they did was safe and then

459
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:04,190
houses just sometimes burn down that way

460
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:06,529
don't you but for some reason it's okay

461
00:21:06,529 --> 00:21:08,450
that we teach people how to you know

462
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:11,330
create like embedded software on medical

463
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,220
devices but then we don't teach them how

464
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,929
to make sure they're secure and then you

465
00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:17,320
know someone hacks someone else's perch

466
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,809
great so yeah so I think that's wrong

467
00:21:20,809 --> 00:21:22,340
that's part of why I'm writing the book

468
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,620
I want it basically I want to like make

469
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,720
a course online that's free and just

470
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,929
kind of like mess with you know the

471
00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:32,059
establishment because I'm like that like

472
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:33,440
if they're not gonna offer to pay me

473
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,960
money I believe four and a half thousand

474
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,279
Canadian dollars it's almost like an

475
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:39,740
insult for that level of work I'm just

476
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,210
like I'll just put it on the internet

477
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:43,610
for free and the poor guy that was like

478
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,529
trying to interview me he just put his

479
00:21:45,529 --> 00:21:49,730
head in his hands I'm sorry but like I'd

480
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:52,010
rather everyone have it you know what I

481
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,210
mean

482
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,340
no it's absolutely fine listen Talia
