help loads and loads and loads of

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,770
companies just getting cyber secure and

14
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,140
so on personally myself former military

15
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:43,290
jumped into another company that that

16
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,539
well it's this lets loosely call it

17
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:48,750
records management for the intelligence

18
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,149
agencies you know I you know jumped in

19
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:53,370
there and of course open a whole new

20
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,640
world and later on I would just join the

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,870
game so yeah oh cool so give us an

22
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,370
indication of what your average day is

23
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:12,630
like what do you do loads of different

24
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,909
days some days it may be helping folks

25
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:21,689
through an incident response after being

26
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:23,939
hacked or a security peach or something

27
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:24,270
like that

28
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,860
some days it will be training loads of

29
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,170
different folks on how to be more so

30
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,369
more secure sometimes running hacker

31
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:40,439
courses and but by far the the biggest

32
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:45,119
part of my day my normal days are to do

33
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,259
with cyber essentials and how to get

34
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:53,009
businesses involved into just just show

35
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:56,460
themselves up in in a way that they

36
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,439
don't get hacked they don't you know

37
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,140
they don't make selling mistakes

38
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,189
ensuring that the controls are in place

39
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:05,610
and you know keep us much away from the

40
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,460
user as possible in terms of the

41
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,190
soles and so on yeah cool on the matter

42
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,860
of cyber essentials yeah

43
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,920
there are dissenting voices in the

44
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,320
industry around the validity and the

45
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,480
quality of cyber essentials and in fact

46
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,790
I in August I was a meeting with GCHQ on

47
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,820
the NCSC I believe pub and and there

48
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,740
were people in the room who are employed

49
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,500
by Her Majesty's Government who said it

50
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,120
was rubbish and they wish they'd never

51
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,880
done it what are your thoughts on that

52
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,830
in terms of the quality of what it can

53
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,290
bring to increasing the posture and the

54
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,600
robustness of a company security okay

55
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,780
the the very first well the very first

56
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,160
things that people should remember this

57
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,950
isn't a pain taste know what for a start

58
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,440
you know this is this is not this is not

59
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,200
gonna be any be all end all thing but

60
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,260
it's one of those things that you know

61
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,470
if if you had no money to spend on your

62
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:07,590
organization and there was a set of

63
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:10,530
guidelines you could follow that would

64
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:16,020
actually make you more secure being more

65
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,060
up-to-date and so on then it's a

66
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,370
fantastic way to go now I've been at

67
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:24,600
many of the meetings with NCSC as well

68
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:30,090
so and the thing that we're trying to to

69
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,150
install in people is just get the basics

70
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:38,340
right go back to basics just just do it

71
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,230
for example you know and earlier on

72
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:45,930
mentioned about pass passwords on

73
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,420
printers and exposing stuff to the

74
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,870
internet you know part of all of this is

75
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,660
checking have I exposed anything to the

76
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:58,260
internet yeah you know have have I

77
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,860
upgraded the firmware have I patched you

78
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,080
know my devices have our patched

79
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,570
operating systems are the are the things

80
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:09,240
that are used from day to day connecting

81
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,340
to the internet is there up-to-date you

82
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,030
know does my antivirus work does my mail

83
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,450
get filtered so that any dangerous

84
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,048
contained

85
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,870
you know before it actually gets to me

86
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:26,450
yeah and similarly with browsers you

87
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,640
know does you know what happens if I

88
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,980
manage to click on the dodgy link and I

89
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,020
download something what will happen will

90
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:37,820
it be quarantined will it be allowed you

91
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,650
know what types of things will be

92
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:42,170
allowed how many clicks does it take to

93
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:45,740
execute the thing windows antivirus kick

94
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:49,670
in windows even group policies coming in

95
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:53,170
in terms of where stuff can execute from

96
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:57,590
your system you know so it's it's all

97
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,200
stuff that you can do and it's not stuff

98
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,690
that you have to spend a million bucks

99
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:05,990
on yeah in a lot of cases a lot of cases

100
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,940
it's included in the operating system

101
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,310
absolutely like yeah no BitLocker and

102
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,090
app Locker and you know it sometimes

103
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:16,160
feels that the Windows operating system

104
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,650
is actually a security solution that

105
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:22,790
also runs programs so so one of the

106
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,730
criticisms of I've heard and I'm a huge

107
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,440
believer in cyber security essentials

108
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,480
actually I feel like it should be a

109
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,700
minimum data protection standard adopted

110
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,280
by the UK government and maybe we're

111
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,390
moving in that direction

112
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:38,540
but the big thing that was missing from

113
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:42,979
the standard was backup they didn't they

114
00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:46,700
didn't mention you know daily backup or

115
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,729
daily off backup wait you know is that

116
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:53,090
an oversight or is it because it wasn't

117
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,160
the this that component wasn't really

118
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,850
considered a security thing by the the

119
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:02,419
purists right so so in no it's not so

120
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:04,760
much about being purists and everything

121
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:09,650
else so the basic cyber Central's part

122
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,810
is about just having the basics in place

123
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:14,780
right so so is all you know all the

124
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,960
things in so once you move up to cyber

125
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,630
essentials plus where it's an audited

126
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,140
part of all of this it actually goes in

127
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:27,740
and one of the questions you may what is

128
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,190
your backup strategy how you know do you

129
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,810
have an online backup strategy

130
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,580
does it do you have offsite them

131
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,560
everything else like that so you do get

132
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,780
to ask the questions during a physical

133
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,650
audit of the organization whether if

134
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:46,800
it's part of the the basic part yes

135
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,590
prosecutor busted in but you know

136
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:52,020
there's about more than 50 questions

137
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:56,490
already yeah so you know and we don't

138
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:59,400
want to sort of exhaust them but just

139
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,020
can I can I ask you a tough question

140
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,860
about that because I I would suggest to

141
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,050
you like Cyber Security Essentials level

142
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:11,400
one is essentially what the business can

143
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,910
self attest to right yeah is it useful

144
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:18,120
at all because the business can't may

145
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,430
not even be able to answer those those

146
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:24,360
questions right no okay so that is a

147
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,800
brilliant question so we've had many

148
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,200
instance I mean but do we fail we do

149
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:38,340
more than a thousand of easy here so so

150
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:43,200
so the so the issues are is that smaller

151
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,330
companies and that maybe have a managed

152
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:49,380
service provider they don't know what

153
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,930
service the many service provider

154
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,630
actually provides so so that

155
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:57,870
questionnaire can act as a checklist so

156
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,520
that you can actually go through says

157
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,310
well have you changed my passwords have

158
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,950
you know have you stopped my stuff being

159
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,630
exposed onto the internet like my

160
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:09,450
printers and I stripes and whatever you

161
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:12,930
know are you updating my antivirus you

162
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,970
know what what other things are you

163
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:18,750
putting in you know in to actually

164
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,440
protect my business so if at any stage

165
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,930
the the guys will actually come back and

166
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:27,810
say we can have to keep you a quote on

167
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,840
that you know they are not doing the

168
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,510
basics they are doing the basics to keep

169
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:38,669
you safe I just love it so we'll send

170
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:40,860
you a quote for the basic stuff that we

171
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,500
already told you we were doing

172
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,290
yeah yeah I think it's a interesting

173
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:47,800
point

174
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,380
I wasn't being mischievous at the start

175
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,050
about about criticizing sad essentials

176
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:56,560
it's so it does get bad press and

177
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,600
obviously there are reasons that you've

178
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,070
described why it's a good thing and I

179
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,050
think the conclusion for me is that

180
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,149
doing something like cyber essentials

181
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:06,279
and I'm guessing they're similar

182
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,350
frameworks that you can adopt is better

183
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,920
than doing nothing

184
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:14,740
I know it's interesting is the UK cyber

185
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,779
security essentials arguably the first

186
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:19,779
sort of standard geared to small medium

187
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:22,950
business has been recently adopted by

188
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:27,670
Canada and then the small business

189
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:31,630
administrative organization SBA in the

190
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:35,020
u.s. also endorsed essentially a

191
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,510
duplicate of cyber security essentials

192
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,000
so it is gaining some momentum and I do

193
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,399
know that if you're part of the Lloyds

194
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,550
Banking Group you have to be cyber

195
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:48,370
security essentials level 2 certified by

196
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,890
a third party yep oh it's starting to

197
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,500
become a thing yeah absolutely yeah you

198
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,610
know earlier on to Morgan he mentioned

199
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:00,370
you know that they use cyber singe cyber

200
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:05,140
essentials as a gap analysis so and it's

201
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:08,440
a really good starting point even even

202
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,620
before you think you're gonna need a

203
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,079
pain taste or something like that you

204
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,149
know going for a pain taste before cyber

205
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:18,550
essentials is stupid

206
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:21,790
you know and it's and it's if you can

207
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,370
catch all the low-hanging fruit first

208
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,899
but just makes it pain tasted work a lot

209
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:29,320
harder and coming back to your thing

210
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,690
about that if you're a business customer

211
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,050
you need to have cyber Central's plus

212
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:38,459
you know it just makes good sense

213
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:41,470
there's quite a lot of organizations

214
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,560
that you know they'll only deal with

215
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,589
other organizations if they are going to

216
00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:53,589
you know if they've proven to have all

217
00:10:53,589 --> 00:10:56,920
the basics in place you know and

218
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,010
if I'm if I'm gonna see receive data

219
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:02,589
from you I want to be sure that all you

220
00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:05,589
would want to be sure that I'm I'm well

221
00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:08,050
prepared for looking after it in terms

222
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:10,330
of you know I'm not gonna get hacked I'm

223
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:12,459
not gonna get my email compromised I'm

224
00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:15,850
not gonna fix supply chain hi yeah yeah

225
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:20,110
yeah yeah makes perfect sense so okay

226
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,000
we've seen you on the conference circuit

227
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,730
quite a bit in the last year you know

228
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,860
maybe particularly up north of the

229
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,380
border we enjoyed your company at

230
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,370
Bayside's Edinburgh which was super cool

231
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:34,209
what are your thoughts on the

232
00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:36,160
information security community and the

233
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,450
things that are going on with we've got

234
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:38,920
a number of conversations other people

235
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,810
about it what are your experiences oh

236
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:46,300
you know being based in Scotland is is

237
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,149
just absolutely phenomenal we have

238
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:52,510
fantastic guys like Stu Hearst just

239
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:55,540
trying to do stuff you're imitable shown

240
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:58,870
as well yeah the list goes on and on and

241
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:04,630
on you know and it's I am super excited

242
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:08,760
but things are gaining so much momentum

243
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,520
we're in tiny wee country but things are

244
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,760
just going absolutely fabulous so so

245
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,060
this year I was fortunate enough to do

246
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,850
the keynote speech at Glasgow Caledonian

247
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:25,300
a cyber conference yeah so their very

248
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,890
first conference being the very first

249
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:31,330
speaker so awesome you know and there

250
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,700
were so many people out there that you

251
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,029
know they want to enter into cyber or

252
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:39,760
information security and you know and

253
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,380
it's not just all about hacking that's

254
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,779
you know there's many many more things

255
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:47,050
like even even even if you're a

256
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:51,820
psychologist even in administration even

257
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,399
you know if you want to be in forensics

258
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,890
if you want to be incident response if

259
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:58,560
you want to be

260
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,720
ah I mean it's it's so wide and and I'm

261
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,569
so happy that that there's so many

262
00:13:06,569 --> 00:13:12,180
programs out there for for kids younger

263
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,569
kids but younger kids older kids young

264
00:13:15,569 --> 00:13:19,379
adults sort of middle adults older

265
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:26,009
adults and even even even old guys like

266
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:29,249
me you know and those old guys like us

267
00:13:29,249 --> 00:13:32,420
hi you know you know that's it's really

268
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:36,540
hard thing to know that nobody will

269
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,399
really be excluded from this because

270
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,920
everybody can bring something to the

271
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,079
party yeah yeah you know be it

272
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:45,930
experience being learning of somebody

273
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:50,220
being a mentor to somebody being you

274
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,079
know it's it's just such a diverse

275
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,800
industry that yeah it needs and I really

276
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,399
think it's gonna grow huge yeah it's

277
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,110
there's something for everybody isn't

278
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,269
there yeah it's nice to see people

279
00:14:06,269 --> 00:14:09,660
specialize but I guess I take some

280
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,980
comfort in the fact that I'm not really

281
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,170
a specialist app SEC is where I come

282
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:16,470
from but I do them everything you know

283
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,269
getting all the building access control

284
00:14:18,269 --> 00:14:22,889
and risk management doing certs of PCI

285
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:25,079
DSS and all that kind of scale there's

286
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:26,579
just never a dull moment

287
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:29,309
I like I like my role in the industry

288
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:31,230
because it's kinda it's for me it's

289
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:33,149
suitably diverse I do bits of everything

290
00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:35,309
and I enjoy it for that reason

291
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:40,040
yeah so so earlier on and then card

292
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:44,339
referred to you know we all should get

293
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:47,339
back to the basics just you know yeah

294
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:49,709
you can be an expert and stuff but to

295
00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:51,929
understand what what the expert but is

296
00:14:51,929 --> 00:14:55,529
you need to understand the basics you

297
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:56,999
know and you have to be really good at

298
00:14:56,999 --> 00:15:00,449
the basics so much so a lot of the work

299
00:15:00,449 --> 00:15:03,329
we get involved in and certainly I I

300
00:15:03,329 --> 00:15:06,800
myself is working with the police and

301
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,920
you know they have this massive struggle

302
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,360
as well on

303
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,200
how to do new stuff you know yeah this

304
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,420
you know how you know how do we

305
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,760
investigate something you know there's a

306
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,459
new there's a new platform popping up

307
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:26,190
you know how do we had to be just how do

308
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:30,930
we even get on it get stuff off it how

309
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,610
do we learn from it you know and it's

310
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,230
it's a massive things if you're working

311
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:36,209
in Incident Response it is because

312
00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:37,920
Incident Response is not you know it's

313
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,110
not just hacking it's you know what

314
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:42,360
happens to the victims afterwards the

315
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,060
the people yeah

316
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,250
there's you know we've seen some

317
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,529
terrible terrible terrible things that

318
00:15:49,529 --> 00:15:53,700
happen on social media where it you know

319
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,060
some posts will result in suicides and

320
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:00,540
of course you know and it's you know the

321
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,209
race is on to how do we learn the new

322
00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:07,079
stuff you know and how do we keep people

323
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:10,459
from being safe on the new stuff yeah

324
00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:12,540
completely completely agree

325
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,490
another thing that's the kind of social

326
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:17,459
around the learning and the and the

327
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:21,510
educating side of things is there's now

328
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:24,690
a rise in the the kind of blue team in

329
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:27,959
the industry in terms of conferences and

330
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:31,680
the subjects and taught materials and I

331
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,029
find that to be really refreshing

332
00:16:33,029 --> 00:16:34,740
because previously when I looked at the

333
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,480
speaker shed mules of a lot of

334
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,790
conferences I'm not gonna name but it

335
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:43,649
tended to be all about reversing and pen

336
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:45,060
testing and all the kind of red tape

337
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,699
stuff and all of the adversarial kind of

338
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:50,220
subjects and I found it a little bit

339
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,810
disheartening and off-putting because

340
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:54,870
that's not me I mean just doing that

341
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,279
kind of stuff but I don't do that I

342
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:57,420
don't get paid to do that

343
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,089
I get paid to defend an organization

344
00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:03,990
yeah yeah kind of work and it's nice now

345
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:07,559
seeing that the defender aspects of what

346
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,869
we do are starting to get bubbles up to

347
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:11,459
the surface publicly and people are

348
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:12,809
talking about it more freely I'm gonna

349
00:17:12,809 --> 00:17:15,240
find that really refreshing yeah it's

350
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,369
almost like you know we're starting to

351
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,179
develop these bespoke tracts of

352
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:22,410
information that you know if you're a

353
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,939
red team or penthouse

354
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:25,888
reverse engineer that's sort of like one

355
00:17:25,888 --> 00:17:29,360
track and then if your if your blue team

356
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,039
web application security

357
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:34,470
you know sim back you know on the other

358
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,049
side and then you know you you have Mike

359
00:17:37,049 --> 00:17:41,490
and I on how to write emails and build

360
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,620
PowerPoint presentations this is true

361
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:47,039
that's that's my day job yeah yeah you

362
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,820
know and a long time ago probably better

363
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,759
decade ago I was working in an

364
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:57,000
investigation team in Hong Kong going

365
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,259
after organized crime and the fortunate

366
00:18:01,259 --> 00:18:05,159
well the good thing is the criminals are

367
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:08,340
no better at protecting lives this fish

368
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:12,659
stuff either they will still use

369
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:16,080
password as a password you know and

370
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,480
they'll not take stuff properly leave

371
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,570
open databases and all kinds of stuff so

372
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:25,049
yeah so so the blue teaming in an

373
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:27,330
operational security and all you know

374
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:31,080
all those kind of things are you know

375
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,679
just stuff I believe just stuff it you

376
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:37,470
have to know you know even if it's just

377
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,629
learning how to set something up

378
00:18:39,629 --> 00:18:43,740
properly and not just go to the start

379
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,139
next next next finish kind of thing he

380
00:18:46,139 --> 00:18:49,909
has a work yeah cool we ready to go yeah

381
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:53,370
it's you know it's a far away from you

382
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:55,409
know far away from keeping stuff secure

383
00:18:55,409 --> 00:19:00,149
yeah great great all right so we got a

384
00:19:00,149 --> 00:19:00,960
minute left

385
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,480
ok in the minute we've got left carry if

386
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,710
you wouldn't mind just giving us an idea

387
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,629
of what your next twelve months is gonna

388
00:19:06,629 --> 00:19:10,320
be like woo well the next twelve months

389
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,759
is going to be lots of lectures lots of

390
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:16,169
new courses I've got a new course

391
00:19:16,169 --> 00:19:20,159
starting at one of universities which is

392
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,070
brilliant

393
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:25,759
hopefully this this next year will be a

394
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:30,090
full-on focus on getting more cyber

395
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:33,179
essentials practitioners ready you know

396
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:35,040
because if if if

397
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,240
the government's gonna make this a

398
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,240
compulsory thing to do for businesses we

399
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,430
nowhere near have enough folks to do

400
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,980
this we talking thousands of thousands

401
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:47,610
of that so and and over the last year in

402
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:50,760
Scotland we've trained probably back 400

403
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:55,590
of em Wow and and it's it's even much

404
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,650
more than what England and Wales and

405
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:00,330
everybody else has so Scotland is right

406
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:03,090
at the top with the most people and even

407
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:06,120
for the small country that we are we

408
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,680
know we're near enough we're nowhere

409
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:12,680
near enough so so yeah it's gonna be a

410
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,020
is gonna be a very heavy focus on on

411
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:19,580
training folks this next year into just

412
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,440
just either getting into cyber security

413
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,880
of information security be defenders be

414
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:31,200
