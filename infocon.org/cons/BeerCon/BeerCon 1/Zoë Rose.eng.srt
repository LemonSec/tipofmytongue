3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,150
person that's like a spiritual farmer

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:11,010
Zoey Rose would be one of them huge

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,829
closed out like I think I'm late in

14
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:50,449
celebrating got my decorate a decade of

15
00:00:50,449 --> 00:00:52,800
technology career I think this is

16
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,199
technically my 11th year now or six

17
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,230
decades and so it's actually kind of a

18
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,059
big change for me and because it's like

19
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:05,939
I've done 10 years and now I'm starting

20
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:09,200
2020 in like really big fresh and

21
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,060
hopefully more exciting look if that's

22
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,909
the right word and what I would say and

23
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:22,590
what else about me oh and obviously

24
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,890
ferret's tech ops also a massive part of

25
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,210
my daily life so definitely going to

26
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:36,000
chat but then in this conference so 2020

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,579
19 they saw you on some huge stages on

28
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:45,270
the on this on the speaking circuit what

29
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,299
advice would you have for folks that are

30
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:51,030
wanting to start out I mean you you how

31
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,720
did you end up starting out as a speaker

32
00:01:53,720 --> 00:02:00,360
well my very first talk was in 2015 it

33
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,719
was back then called besides with a pig

34
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:09,239
and if you remember in and I talks about

35
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,030
network configuration management very

36
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,240
sexy I know

37
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,470
and but it was in a pub and I got 150

38
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,440
people I think was the the numbers at

39
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,660
the time excited and they were Mike

40
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,940
hacker hacker type people you know they

41
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,950
were they were nerdy but they were also

42
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,690
like you know talking about the cool

43
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,820
signs of security and I got them excited

44
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,100
about network configuration management

45
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,890
and I thought that was mind you I also

46
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,650
created a tool that I was demoing that

47
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,590
was super insecure because I didn't

48
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:44,620
really like I built it knowing it wasn't

49
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,490
quality

50
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:48,370
but just as a concept not as I don't

51
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,570
know verdict loss on your network it

52
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:53,910
would be a horrible idea everybody then

53
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,510
using Python PHP which I still don't

54
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:05,140
know you know I had SQL it was in it had

55
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:09,040
it was vulnerable to SQL injection and I

56
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,860
used a bit over HTML obviously for the

57
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,570
website and then CSS to make it look

58
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,340
really sexy so it was a black website

59
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,190
with green text obviously hacker wish

60
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,980
and very eat super but put the whole

61
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,080
point of it was it was such a boring

62
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,790
topic to put something that I absolutely

63
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:27,070
loved and then people in the audience at

64
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:27,970
a pub maybe

65
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,250
Al Gore helped but they were excited

66
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,130
about it too and so I think that that

67
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,320
still to this day is one of my favorite

68
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,710
talks wasn't great the quality of the

69
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,530
top probably wasn't there but it was

70
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,730
something that I was really passionate

71
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,310
about and I carry that through in every

72
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,410
tox that I ever do it's always something

73
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,330
that I'm really excited about it I want

74
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,030
to share and when I get feedback

75
00:03:52,030 --> 00:04:21,070
besides the spiteful really when you do

76
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,980
a talk do something a passion about

77
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:26,000
because it's not easy

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,920
and you're not going to know everything

79
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,320
and you're not you're not going to

80
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,850
necessarily be able to answer all the

81
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,340
questions but the fact that you go up

82
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,740
there and you express something that you

83
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,320
really want to make a difference and to

84
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,380
share and then you know get other people

85
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,450
in the audience excited with you that is

86
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,100
the best feeling ever

87
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,950
and then my recent talk I spoke at go to

88
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,150
Copenhagen I think that was my last note

89
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,730
besides Copenhagen so those two in the

90
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:59,720
same week and afterwards it's I spoke

91
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,850
about saying with two deep topics well I

92
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,760
people coming up to me after and besides

93
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,530
Copenhagen one was like you know what I

94
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:08,000
really liked your definition of

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,880
diversity because he said that you know

96
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,990
everybody always talks about gender

97
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:14,030
diversity but what about the different

98
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:17,870
things like tech and and experiences and

99
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,460
so and so forth and for him that was

100
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,050
really impactful and that made me really

101
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,070
happy and then besides and Copenhagen

102
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,960
Copenhagen it was their first one and

103
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,990
one it was brilliant I was the only

104
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:34,010
female speaker but unfortunately

105
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,229
somebody made a very rude comment well

106
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:38,150
it wasn't right if they asked me if I

107
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:42,080
was single in my questions time but the

108
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,150
organizers right away stepped in were

109
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,430
like that's not appropriate and don't do

110
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,470
that you know and reminded everybody

111
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:51,830
about the code of conduct and everything

112
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,300
and I thought that was really brilliant

113
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,460
because I laughed it off because you

114
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,830
know I get that sometimes it's you know

115
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,690
whether or not they think I'm attractive

116
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,100
I don't really care but it's really

117
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,100
awkward and I did remind them that my

118
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,210
very large polish partner was there for

119
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,790
them but the fact that the organisers

120
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,680
stepped up and were like that's not okay

121
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,200
right away was brilliant and it was

122
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,390
really supportive you know and so I

123
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,370
think there's you know not only did I

124
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,950
get to share my passion but the minute

125
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,680
somebody was like I'm gonna ruin this

126
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,650
exciting moment for you the organisers -

127
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,240
I've been you know made the difference

128
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,100
and honestly it's one of my favourite

129
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,010
conferences the fact that they did that

130
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:35,250
not that it wasn't a brilliant copper's

131
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,610
it was a Capri and then also afterwards

132
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:42,360
so I volunteer with operation safe

133
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:42,990
escape

134
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:47,670
it's an American based not-for-profit

135
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:52,110
for victims of abuse and then helps

136
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,970
helps them get out of it so they can you

137
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,980
know these fibers of abuse you know goes

138
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,720
out to that dangerous environment and

139
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,390
start their new life safely and when I

140
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,880
mentioned that just briefly not in depth

141
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,920
somebody came up to me afterwards and

142
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,990
said you know I really like that you

143
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,630
mentioned this and I have a friend

144
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,010
that's going through something that I

145
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,810
would like to provide them with advice

146
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:16,560
and so I was able to direct them to go

147
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,750
ask Rose the public website for

148
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,870
operation safe escape and to me that

149
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:24,150
even if they didn't even if the audience

150
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,280
didn't actually learn anything from me I

151
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,720
hope they did but even if they didn't

152
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,730
just having that one person being able

153
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:32,400
to find support through me was probably

154
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,370
the most I don't know is probably the

155
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:38,810
most rewarding thing and so I guess my

156
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:42,600
very rambly way of saying you know if

157
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,370
you're going to speak speak about your

158
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:48,560
passion and celebrate the small wins and

159
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,190
because it's really easy and I do this

160
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:56,220
today is get feedback and then I see all

161
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,070
the good stuff and then I see that one

162
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,870
jerk response and I just feel to say

163
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,910
would you motivated and I'm like oh I

164
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:05,070
didn't do anything it wasn't good enough

165
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:08,310
this one person says I'm horrible and

166
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,870
I'm listening to them and that's

167
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:12,840
absolutely silly so I guess yeah just

168
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,780
celebrate your wins and talk about your

169
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,229
passion

170
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,230
even had the question yeah I was gonna

171
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,480
get Shawn to jump in with a question but

172
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:30,930
I guess he's away from that oh there is

173
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:35,169
no good so so one of the things I've

174
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:38,349
seen a lot happening recently is a lot

175
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:41,469
of negativity especially like trolli and

176
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:43,450
then that kind of thing so what are your

177
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,100
thoughts on that like how do you

178
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,830
recommend people should kind of avoid

179
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,480
that or switch it off do you have any

180
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,470
sort of things that you used and it's

181
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,960
really easy to get caught up in the

182
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,070
drama I like to call it drama Lamas

183
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:03,460
because mom must make me laugh and it's

184
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,650
kind of a great way to like instantly

185
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,540
make myself smile and so I kind of

186
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,090
remove myself from that and what I think

187
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:13,390
I think the biggest challenge is this

188
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:17,410
industry is so I'm right and you're

189
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:19,960
wrong you know it's so negative it's so

190
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:28,270
not toxic and it's really easy to just

191
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:30,339
go down that rabbit hole and just keep

192
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:32,740
getting toxic and keep getting worse and

193
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,860
keep getting more angry and but actually

194
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:39,400
and what I think this year has been a

195
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,430
big big reminder for me is if you don't

196
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:44,800
know last year I was diagnosed with

197
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,390
depression and it was really like

198
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:51,190
horrible i I've never had to deal with

199
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,080
depression before in my entire life I

200
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,350
had no idea what it was and honestly it

201
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,030
got to the point where I couldn't work I

202
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,770
couldn't eat I couldn't get out of bed

203
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:03,040
there was so bad and over the last year

204
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,770
it was just me kind of relearning how to

205
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:08,620
do things and relearning how to you know

206
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,480
I know on the outside I you know kept

207
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,670
doing conferences I've kept going to

208
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:15,880
work but outside of that and I did

209
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,240
nothing I went home and I went to sleep

210
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,190
and it was really horrendous but in the

211
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:24,310
last year I started something called

212
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:29,590
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and it's basically

213
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:34,300
a great way to define it is some people

214
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,490
call it chests for people other people

215
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:39,070
call it folding clothes with the person

216
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,050
still inside of it

217
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:45,610
it's brilliant fun and it's ridiculous

218
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:48,670
and you get to wear awesome clothing and

219
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:51,580
but the reason that for me was really

220
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,880
impactful is because it's not my daily

221
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,430
job you know it's something I do outside

222
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,770
of security and it was a great way to

223
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:02,230
you know get active and then women when

224
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,990
the drama llamas of the security

225
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,600
industry came came up and attacked me I

226
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,940
would just turn it off though offline

227
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,810
and then go to the gym and it also let

228
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,160
me meet my partner which was quite

229
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:15,520
lovely

230
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,390
so that also had a positive obviously

231
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:22,990
having a safe and welcoming home is

232
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:27,130
massively beneficial and is the reason I

233
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:30,790
relocated to Ireland and you know being

234
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:34,420
able to admit when I need help was a

235
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:37,480
really hard lesson for me and but I

236
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,280
think it's also a really hard lesson for

237
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,430
people of this industry where typically

238
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:45,100
if I say I don't know something I get

239
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:45,940
ridiculed

240
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:49,600
whereas if in a developer conference I

241
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,839
say you know X Y Zed about security

242
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:54,160
they'll come up to be an after and be

243
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,300
like oh that's really interesting I

244
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,250
didn't know that and they're happy to

245
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,080
admit it I mean I don't work in the

246
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,200
developer industry but from the outside

247
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,660
point of view looking in I've noticed a

248
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,490
difference in their kind of security

249
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,890
comfort or their in conferences it's

250
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,630
almost safer to be like I don't know

251
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:13,690
that where is in security a lot of times

252
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:16,209
it doesn't feel safe to admit that I

253
00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:17,890
don't know something and I actually

254
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:21,280
still get anxious about it but so I

255
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,400
guess I'm really rambling sorry but

256
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,080
basically getting out of that

257
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,320
drama-filled

258
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,660
toxic environment is actually stepping

259
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,630
back and recognizing those people that

260
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:37,720
are being so toxic I pity them because

261
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,480
they're really unhappy whereas I've got

262
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,070
this brilliant community

263
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:46,570
in the BJJ you know gym community here

264
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:49,090
in Ireland I have a brilliant partner I

265
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:51,070
have ferrets that are absolutely

266
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,800
ridiculous and they literally you can't

267
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,930
be sad around them they are Instagram

268
00:12:55,930 --> 00:13:01,930
famous that's and the funniest part is

269
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:04,090
when I go to conferences they get more

270
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:07,990
followers like it's really weird but

271
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:10,240
they just they make me happy and is you

272
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,970
know just having those outside and

273
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,800
outside points of view is really

274
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,070
massively beneficial also I mean Ian's

275
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:21,010
on here other people in the security

276
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,260
industry but Ian's being the one that

277
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,690
I'm you know talking to when I was

278
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:27,250
feeling really really bad you know one

279
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,010
message him and he would be like don't

280
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,950
be silly Zoe you know we kind of need

281
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:36,940
you ritual I had one or two to be honest

282
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,210
and you know this is the community that

283
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:43,180
I think is can be under the right

284
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,700
circumstances incredibly supportive and

285
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,970
I actually wanted cybersex student jump

286
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:52,270
in on this because he's got a lot of

287
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,700
experience I think dealing with that

288
00:13:54,700 --> 00:14:02,230
toxic element so yeah do you do you

289
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:05,590
resume you commiserate with Zoe or yeah

290
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:19,890
I think it's because it's nice friendly

291
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,850
everyone's there to learn and everyone's

292
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:25,860
there to help each other collaboration

293
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,210
can be quite solitary in some cases

294
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:31,050
right so there might be that kind of

295
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:33,040
cultural thing right where they used to

296
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,690
work you to tea to build something and

297
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:37,120
therefore you know it's very much that

298
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,110
kind of mentality of cross collaboration

299
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:42,550
probably drives that mentality where

300
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:45,510
suppose that you can

301
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,200
I think other kids there it's a very

302
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,910
small group but they get a very big

303
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:59,060
voice I think that attracts Twitter

304
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:08,930
drama around the crowd will jump in on

305
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:17,090
that because easier to always try to

306
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,400
challenge as much as I can and I've had

307
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,510
quite a lot of recent experience of

308
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:23,660
people that when you call something out

309
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:28,719
I think you you get as much attention

310
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,620
it's also often I often find this on

311
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,780
Twitter particularly it's easy to pick a

312
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,460
fight but it's to focus on why we're all

313
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:43,400
doing all the stuff in the first place I

314
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,100
often find because I can be quite

315
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,810
argumentative I think it's fair to say

316
00:15:47,810 --> 00:16:05,210
you particularly know well but it's

317
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,950
challenged the word is challenge that

318
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:10,100
you're looking for there but it's I

319
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,320
don't find it easy to mute and move on

320
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,840
that's the point I'm making up I find it

321
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,090
a lot easier I think to go back to the

322
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,310
the troll or the idiot that's out there

323
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,260
on Twitter and can just try and take

324
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:21,830
them down

325
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:24,020
I do have case history so I'm just

326
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,490
probably the opposite end of that scale

327
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,140
um I'm not I don't find it very easy

328
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,390
just to forget about it but you know

329
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,370
what you knew what one thing that really

330
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:34,460
resonated with me which my partner's he

331
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,950
would always say to me you know that's a

332
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,870
little problem you know that's that's

333
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:42,200
nothing your life itself in your

334
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,810
happiness is so much more valuable than

335
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:48,320
that person's negativity so really as

336
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,720
much and don't you wrong I still trusted

337
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,060
as well like that person on the Internet

338
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,420
is wrong I want to correct them but it's

339
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,280
almost like it's not worth it like I

340
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,890
like that an analogy I don't know who it

341
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,580
was but somebody shared

342
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,319
the number of spoons you have in a day

343
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:07,359
and you only have a certain amount and

344
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,069
you know sometimes you have less

345
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,810
sometimes with more would you have to be

346
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:14,410
very careful about not overusing it or

347
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,780
running out before the use a day and and

348
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,190
that to me really made sense

349
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:20,140
maybe not speeding sport maybe something

350
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,109
else Bob but just the fact that actually

351
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:25,900
as much as I want to correct that person

352
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,630
as much as I want to say no you're wrong

353
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,760
you're a jerk stop doing that on the

354
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,250
other hand it's like give up why bother

355
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,400
causing that grief in my in my chest in

356
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,830
that in my heart and make myself suffer

357
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,810
longer because I'm giving that person

358
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,340
the power to make me unhappy

359
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,730
so in fact actually if I just ignore

360
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,710
them and I've been doing it I am very

361
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:51,490
liberal with my mute buttons now I quite

362
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:55,450
love that meeting so I'll just meet the

363
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,130
person and be like you know it that

364
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,600
person doesn't matter to me anymore

365
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,820
and I'm going to focus on the people

366
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,680
that do you master like talking to my

367
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,810
friends the community and the people

368
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:06,910
that are mentoring because if I'm going

369
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:09,430
to mentor someone and advise them to do

370
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,530
something just like my clients I tell

371
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:14,020
them to do X Y Zed for their security I

372
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,990
better you know I bloody hell better do

373
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:19,360
it myself because if I don't then I'm

374
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,220
just being a hypocrite and I'm being

375
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,470
just as bad as the malicious actor

376
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,510
because I'm almost I feel like I'm

377
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,790
always lying to these people and telling

378
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,590
them to do something that I can't do

379
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,770
myself yeah I think I agree with I

380
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,520
completely agree with what you're saying

381
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,230
I think sometimes I think it's a case of

382
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:39,130
it's a case-by-case basis I mean in will

383
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:41,260
remember my exchange is fallen off which

384
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,780
happens oh yeah and here we have an

385
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,800
example of a right-wing clearly a racist

386
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:51,010
misogynistic bastard right and he needed

387
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,720
taking down he was destroying a lot of

388
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,420
people's lives and I just thought at the

389
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,250
time yeah you can't ignore people like

390
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,570
this but they're just gonna go away and

391
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:01,060
really another people times that's a

392
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:01,840
fair point

393
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,410
yeah yeah what but going back to that

394
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,810
statement it's only doing as much as you

395
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,910
can and you don't ruin your life to try

396
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:12,490
and you know stop someone get the

397
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,950
support of your community and you know

398
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:15,590
take care

399
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:18,139
your health because I would like to get

400
00:19:18,139 --> 00:19:19,999
to the point where I remember those

401
00:19:19,999 --> 00:19:21,950
years ago I was part of this community

402
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:24,080
and I loved it and then there's two

403
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,389
people that decided they hated me and

404
00:19:26,389 --> 00:19:28,519
they kicked me out of my own community

405
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:30,649
and it really broke my heart and I

406
00:19:30,649 --> 00:19:33,019
really felt awful about it for a long

407
00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:35,090
time and maybe it's just I'm getting

408
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,830
older but then I started to realize that

409
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:40,190
well if that community some of the

410
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:42,620
people still chat with me and but the

411
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,419
ones that didn't and decided to listen

412
00:19:44,419 --> 00:19:46,909
to the person lined or lying about me

413
00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:49,309
maybe they weren't as closer friends

414
00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:51,440
that I thought they were so you know

415
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,899
like kind of measuring what's the

416
00:19:53,899 --> 00:19:56,570
healthy amount of drama can I handle how

417
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,460
many drama normos can i balance in my

418
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,740
daily so I do agree

419
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:04,179
using my you know influencer or power

420
00:20:04,179 --> 00:20:07,730
whatever I do have it's not much for

421
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:11,649
sometimes I think my favorites have more

422
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,320
beneficial but also not the detriment

423
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,580
myself yeah okay that's perfect okay

424
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:26,119

425
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:28,429
