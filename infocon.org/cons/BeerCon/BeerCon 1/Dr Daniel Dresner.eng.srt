1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,570
hello everyone out in a beer Conn land I

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,779
am now joined with dr. Daniel Dresner

3
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:10,280
and I just have to say it's professor

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,990
professor alright well you you got a

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,809
little - you my people here they've got

6
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:18,810
my notes they said dr. let's call you

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,189
professor ii first of all tell us what

8
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:25,680
your professor of and tell us about your

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:34,230
passion a few months back I was actually

10
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,050
told well I should become a professor of

11
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,480
cyber of computer science because it

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,070
gives it general enough and I never have

13
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,710
to specialize and I think well least to

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,710
say in Reggie Perrin showing my age I

15
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,600
didn't get where I was today without

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,789
talking about cybersecurity so I'm quite

17
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:52,590
happy to be called a professor of

18
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,199
cybersecurity I'm not sure whether the

19
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,539
acronym metric metric necessarily works

20
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,629
but it certainly better than a colleague

21
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:02,370
of mine who went for a professor of

22
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:10,530
information system security right I just

23
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,049
love the interaction what the underlying

24
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:15,150
title the underlying title of it says on

25
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,100
my business card I asked them for a job

26
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,080
title which neither sounded silly and

27
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,030
would fit in a business card so they

28
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,390
printed it very small so I'm the

29
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,000
academic coordinator for cyber security

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,280
at the University but that basically

31
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,549
means I have a wonderful time breaking

32
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:34,740
out of the usual computer science and

33
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,000
maths and get to talk to the

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,450
psychologists and the engineer's right

35
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:41,909
forensic linguists are brilliant I'm the

36
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:45,299
new fanboy forensic linguist now that's

37
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:47,490
amazing and you're at the University of

38
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,200
Manchester and you've been doing this

39
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,820
now for how many years well the the pure

40
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,909
university stuff this is my 15th year

41
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,640
right 15 year prior to that I was at the

42
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,579
national computing center and I used to

43
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:05,759
go to an industrial Azon panel and bang

44
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,590
the table and say where's security on

45
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,100
the timetable and they kind of

46
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,290
rummage through some stuff and find it

47
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,490
was about you know an hour on the

48
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,440
Tuesday afternoon he graduated in

49
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:20,020
November unfortunately isn't with us

50
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,850
anymore phoned up and she was he said

51
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,950
three things she said there's a hole in

52
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,170
the time table there's a lot of people

53
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,820
on sabbatical so they couldn't fill it

54
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,220
and most importantly for my masters of

55
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,490
the national computing set Center they

56
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:36,400
had some money so they suppose seconded

57
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,680
me or hired me out so I used to go in

58
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,210
just a couple of times a year to teach

59
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:44,490
me on modules the building which I think

60
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,900
well you know know it Marian but

61
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,640
certainly it took me eight years before

62
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,110
I turn the right way at the top of the

63
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,940
stairs and have to do this kind of long

64
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,370
figure of eight around the two bodies or

65
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,120
I know what I know it well and let me

66
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,720
just kind of talk a little bit about how

67
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,180
awesome it is that you reach out to the

68
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:08,920
industry to bring in folks to lecture to

69
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,070
your master's students tell me a little

70
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:15,550
bit about why you chosen to bring in

71
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:24,700
sort of these industry people my success

72
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,650
is that I'll be blessed with having a

73
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:31,050
big foot in industry and then eventually

74
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:34,600
tiptoed into academia I mean I've just

75
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,100
found a school report recently which is

76
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,560
a Daniel is not strong academically but

77
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,050
and they may still be right about that

78
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,630
so I think the great thing about this

79
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,490
job is recommend it's back to the

80
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,520
academic coordinator side of stuff is

81
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,240
recognizing that yeah I could probably

82
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,540
write down some real fanboy names of

83
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,400
people who I think really do know

84
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,250
everything but on the whole it's the way

85
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,130
that people specialize right the way

86
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,350
that people that those people who

87
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:06,310
specialize who understand that they have

88
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,100
a particular view and they're prepared

89
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,450
to share it and they're prepared to

90
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,390
collaborate and cooperate so rather than

91
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:16,329
me talking generally about stuff that

92
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:18,190
I've touched and had connections with

93
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,760
beyond my own experience I just think

94
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,450
there is nothing

95
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,900
bringing in somebody who has you know if

96
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,640
has sweated I've seen their blood

97
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,190
pressure go up a little bit in some some

98
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,680
years ago some years ago I think I would

99
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,310
say that the UK got interested in

100
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,380
InfoSec back in 2008 when the Child

101
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,650
Benefit discs went missing and I was

102
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,090
being interviewed because I would not

103
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,880
because I was me but because I was had a

104
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,250
big mouth about these things and worked

105
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,020
at the national computing Center so it

106
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,520
was always good to get a quote from the

107
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,150
national computing Center and the person

108
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,740
who was interviewing me said well I

109
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,570
suppose you wouldn't give that person

110
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,940
their job and I said no far from it

111
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,290
I certainly wouldn't give the person

112
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,090
who'd lost those disks a job on the

113
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:06,400
basis that they'd experienced it as

114
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,380
opposed to the rest of us who were just

115
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,330
who just live in fear put in the

116
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,100
controls and hope that it's going to

117
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,370
work you know it's a really good

118
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:18,400
observation and we've seen we've seen

119
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,740
the question kind of go around of what

120
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,750
you hire see so that's been through a

121
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,630
data breach or you know or do you want

122
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,910
to see so that's never had a data breach

123
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,480
and and it seemed to be to come out of

124
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,850
the other end that that the C so that's

125
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:37,120
been through data breach is preferred in

126
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,550
that they have that experience of being

127
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:43,030
in the hot seat now you are generating

128
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:47,070
you are force generating master students

129
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:51,490
in information security graduating from

130
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,680
you know Manchester University which is

131
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,720
pretty prestigious not too shabby at all

132
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,070
what do you sort of what do you see the

133
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:06,040
master's student equipped to do in the

134
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:12,790
industry that we bring is just that

135
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,740
Chinese is actually just a general

136
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,170
change in attitude I mean we have

137
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,610
generally about I get really pretty

138
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,290
about hundreds averaging out of a

139
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,730
hundred students a year now I used to

140
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:24,780
get more but too many of them have been

141
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,700
entranced and go wandering zombie-like

142
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:31,710
towards anything with say a eye on it

143
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:34,240
with a bit of luck they might do cyber

144
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,630
stuff and AI

145
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,460
time tables don't clash but what I'm

146
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,680
trying to do essentially is to create a

147
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,640
fifth column of bread some of whom will

148
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,980
be out there you know doing my best for

149
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,930
call it pure cyber stuff you know

150
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,440
they'll be get a career in cyber other

151
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,870
ones who might actually be the ones I'm

152
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,090
more interested will be embedded doing

153
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:59,120
whatever role they are websiteís tough

154
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,850
at the back of their mind some years ago

155
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,770
actually when we were getting loads and

156
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,450
loads of students you know we'd get a

157
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:08,570
couple of hundred students on these

158
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:14,210
modules together have a cyber label one

159
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,970
of my colleagues who had slightly more

160
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,740
hair to tear out than that that I got

161
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,260
was obviously fine you know was looking

162
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,270
at the marking side of stuff that we do

163
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,700
because okay the the timetables are

164
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,770
nicely laid out so the students have

165
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,290
time to take things in but it's all the

166
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,970
sudden rush at the end when they do

167
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:34,100
their coursework and hunger and the

168
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,350
exams in to actually get feedback to

169
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,690
them and get the marks out and all that

170
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,040
kind of stuff than your traditional

171
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,670
University challenges and she suggested

172
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,500
that maybe we should have some entry

173
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,960
criteria restricts entry criteria which

174
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,610
would mean that we'd already creamed off

175
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,530
the very best students in the first

176
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:54,290
place right and I said well that's very

177
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,880
nice and obviously you know you know

178
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,100
this is the whole league table schools

179
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,790
business of kind of you know going

180
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,620
through too many formulas and coming out

181
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,390
with things that look nice and shiny in

182
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,580
the numbers depart but I said no I'd

183
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,560
rather I didn't want to fail anybody and

184
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,140
I never do and I hate the responsibility

185
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,370
of marking because you've got you know

186
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:15,290
you've got a paper in front of you and

187
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:19,070
somebody's life it could pivot on a

188
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,380
mohawk and sometimes very difficult or

189
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,000
just nothing there worth marking it's

190
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,980
very sad I said I'd rather people came

191
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,020
on these modules got some sort of

192
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,060
inkling some sort of understanding which

193
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:32,360
we might not necessarily sink in just

194
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,960
then and certainly some people come in

195
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,849
probably expecting to be given a hoodie

196
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:39,740
and to do something like hackers or

197
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,490
sneakers or whatever yeah

198
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,800
they're probably very disappointed with

199
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,160
me because I like my main focus is about

200
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,709
risk and governance raised on I'm trying

201
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:52,850
to teach them to see it's you know it's

202
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,320
it to see the bigger picture and not

203
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,709
lose sight of the the objectives and and

204
00:08:57,709 --> 00:08:59,779
for themselves to recognize that they

205
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:01,790
need to call areas of expertise so the

206
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:05,330
idea in my idea is of that there will

207
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:07,100
come a time when somebody might be out

208
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,220
there in their organization might be

209
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,170
just in their family situation and they

210
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,610
will make the right decision they will

211
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,290
make that little bit of improvement that

212
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:17,899
will you know allow them to well it's

213
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:19,730
one of the DS you know is it deflect and

214
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:24,440
I possibly deceive destroy essentially

215
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,290
says stop Anna tackle at the very least

216
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:30,470
reduces impact all right well thank you

217
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,570
so much for giving us an overview of

218
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,459
where you're at with the master's

219
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:36,680
program and I mean your contributions

220
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,700
are going to be felt for the for the

221
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,480
years ahead first for sure and so thank

222
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,170
you very much
