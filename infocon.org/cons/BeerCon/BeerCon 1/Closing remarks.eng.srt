involved in it listening to us listening

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,690
to our speakers without which it would

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:13,559
have been a completely pointless

6
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:15,210
exercise per se

7
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,670

throughout the entire 24 hours and 21

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,110
minutes what we've been doing in fact a

14
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,730
little bit before that while we got set

15
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,090
up yes we had a couple of problems to

16
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,920
begin with last night but it didn't

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,050
affect anything we were trying to do and

18
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,649
that's in every part down Matt and rad

19

21
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,680
engineering the infrastructure was there

22
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,440
the sound worked you could hear people

23
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,510
speak and that was exactly what the

24
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,909
whole thing was all about so I want to

25
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:07,920

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,980
great community yeah

60
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,770
it's never easy giving money away when

61
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,150
you're not a child sure where it's going

62
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:50,180
or you know not even he's got money that

63
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,650
they can throw away at things like this

64
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,080
so we we can't thank you enough

65
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,760
if you've given money we're gonna leave

66
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,670
the fund raiser open on go from me until

67
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:01,400
the end of the year so the 31st of

68
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,020
December is when we'll shut it down

69
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:06,860
around midnight that's been absolutely

70
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,020
amazing it seems to me a bit of a

71
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,630
whirlwind year for the bear farmers so

72
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,120
we started out in August last year was a

73
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,940
thing so in just over a year we've kind

74
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,580
of gone from being Apes on the internet

75
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,709
and on Twitter just taking the piss out

76
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:23,720
of the industry through to delivering

77
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,450
our first combine talk as a team boo

78
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:30,110
sighs leads in January we've got Mark

79
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,610
Carney to thank for that because he took

80
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,620
upon what we were doing thought it was

81
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,300
interesting and thought there was some

82
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,430
validity in it and how about not

83
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,470
happened naturally then what we've done

84
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,850
in the last 24 hours wouldn't have

85
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:41,420
happened either

86
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,430
never have had the confidence to do it

87
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,140
we would have probably abandoned the

88
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,690
project there's a bit of a idea and

89
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:50,060
I've gone about our separate ways but it

90
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,800
didn't and we've got an excellent year

91
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,280
going around the UK meeting new people

92
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,320
talking about stuff learning new stuff

93
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,209
and it's given us confidence and giving

94
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:01,940
us belief that what we tried to do with

95
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,640
Viacom 1 was worth doing and it's proved

96
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,480
itself right so we can't be happier as a

97
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,989
team and I think I'm gonna probably

98
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:13,340
leave it there we don't know what we're

99
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:17,899
gonna do in 2020 watch this space but

100
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:19,640
again thank you very much for everybody

101
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,410

102
