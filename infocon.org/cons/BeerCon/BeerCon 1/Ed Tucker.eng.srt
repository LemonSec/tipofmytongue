1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:03,000
so who do we have up next oh god I took

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,490
her up next that's exciting

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,170
and I reckon that we probably don't have

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,790
to do any prompting without it because

5
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,710
we know him quite well and he's kind of

6
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:21,060
like got a lot to say so you want to

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,109
turn a mic up a little bit

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:38,879
absolutely perfect legend legend he's

9
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,360
the guy's a star and to prefer a damn

10
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,460
he's big part parcel of what the bear

11
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,750
farmers have been doing all year long

12
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,329
you know we did it we did the CTF thing

13
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:50,700
for B sighs London and Dunn did that for

14
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,820
us and you know it was a triviality in

15
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,199
many ways because we gave away a hoodie

16
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,489
at the end of it but done went away

17
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:58,980
behind the scenes built the CTF we run

18
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,160
the CTF somebody wanted hoodie and that

19
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,300
person that will know hoodie was

20
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:10,200
absolutely smitten it was he's one of

21
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,930
the most busy people I know yeah yeah

22
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,119
constantly on the go constantly on the

23
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,070
go

24
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,259
[Music]

25
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:40,770
he loves James Bond might be it is Aston

26
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:47,960
when he does is talk you don't don't

27
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:54,869
alright let's crack on with that I do

28
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:57,659
good evening you okay I'm good me I'm

29
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:02,430
good how's it all you're going all right

30
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,439
a couple of technical issues but yeah

31
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,500
but the people that you can't see

32
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,449
managed to make it pretty smooth yeah

33
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:11,160
you you wouldn't notice you wouldn't

34
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,330
notice you

35
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,890
so we've got people we've got a place

36
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,350
with people to speak we've got a place

37
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,060
for people to listen that's exactly what

38
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,580
we need that's all you need the last

39
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,930
thing you need these hiccups kind of

40
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,580
going through but you've you've ridden

41
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,500
it well so far so you know welcome to

42
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,850
welcome to the world of live services

43
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:31,050
well exactly right right now so you know

44
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,760
the script in that there isn't the

45
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,300
script awesome so what do you want to

46
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:41,010
talk about earlier as to kind of wha

47
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,870
what's been floating my boat recently

48
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,230
probably the one thing that I call out

49
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:48,150
and I kind of touched on it when I we

50
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,160
were up in ignite although after a few

51
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,360
beers it didn't really go as well as I

52
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,220
wanted essentially around dislocation

53
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,290
and when I say dislocation ease is the

54
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,620
the fact that in so many aspects of

55
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,860
security there is a clear disjoint

56
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,290
between what we need to achieve and what

57
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,650
we're actually doing on a daily basis

58
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:13,050
agreed and you'd say that from the you

59
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,370
know there's a complete disjoint between

60
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,920
the vendor community and and I put the

61
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,360
analyst community because there more

62
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,550
than dissuade and the actual defender

63
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:24,690
community there's huge dislocation in

64
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,370
the defender community between what

65
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:29,880
different teams do the dependencies they

66
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,040
have within other team for their it's in

67
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,590
OIT whether it's in wider business

68
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,140
covered by process and people failures

69
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,450
and there's a flare dislocation evening

70
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,010
security itself yeah I mean how many

71
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,420
times did you see an education and

72
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,640
awareness team that doesn't actually it

73
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,800
is in no way aware of working with their

74
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,330
operations team when it comes to

75
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,850
actually educating the workforce and

76
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,050
it's something that I think weren't

77
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:55,140
until we start to relocate these things

78
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,760
or actually understand our dependencies

79
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,770
and join things back together join the

80
00:03:58,770 --> 00:03:59,910
dots back together and start working

81
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,730
collaboratively that essentially we're

82
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:03,989
just gonna go out there doing the same

83
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:05,400
thing we've done for god knows how many

84
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,100
years now and perpetually failure good

85
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:08,519
point

86
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,580
so in in in a business and I work in a

87
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,950
business I guess the example I've seen

88
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,649
is where you've got the

89
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:18,779
systems development team so guys at

90
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:21,060
write software for a living

91
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,710
you've got infrastructure people so

92
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,630
they're building servers and other stuff

93
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,380
whether it be on Prem or SAS or whatever

94
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,479
you've got the networking people and

95
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,270
then out here a little a little island

96
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,600
you've got the security and I guess the

97
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,180
challenge we have is becoming integrated

98
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,919
with all of those disciplines and

99
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:45,150
getting our views and our consultancy

100
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,560
and advice and all that kind of sort of

101
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,630
pushed as far left as possible I think

102
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,840
for me as a kind of leads a team trying

103
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,660
to do that that's our biggest challenge

104
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,870
yep I'd say it's not an isolated

105
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,060
challenge that's that by any means just

106
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,150
security as well certainly where are we

107
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,560
know where I've worked previously

108
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,090
there's been a disjoint between say

109
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,190
digital teams in that more software

110
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,080
delivery side of things that iterative

111
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,030
side that development side and the

112
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,530
incumbent kind of IT facets that they

113
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,590
have to work with like networks and and

114
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:20,970
for example kind of cloud or

115
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,590
infrastructure teams or whoever it

116
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,840
happens to be and live services the

117
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,310
people who then have to run it and make

118
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,870
it happen and make change management

119
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:31,229
happen and just disjoined between all of

120
00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:34,380
these teams that when it works badly you

121
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,880
just end up with a whole bunch of people

122
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,590
just butting heads against each other

123
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:40,800
yeah that really hampers the ability to

124
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,510
deliver what really matters which is

125
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,810
actually let's have systems services

126
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,030
technology that our customers which will

127
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,560
be the customers within the business and

128
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,320
the customers outside of the business

129
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,229
can actually use our simple effective

130
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:58,229
and available and from a security angle

131
00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:04,110
are ideally as least risky as possible

132
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,120
or at least within a comfort zone of

133
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,300
risk so can I can I go back to that

134
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,580
point because I think you're breaking

135
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,340
into an area that that I think we do

136
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,620
have a problem and when you talk about

137
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,860
these groups not being able to come

138
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,690
together in the interests of the

139
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,120
business do you feel it's because we're

140
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,460
we're maybe promoting the wrong people

141
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,710
we take very strong technical people and

142
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:29,580
then we

143
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,490
okay poof you're a manager and then we

144
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,410
don't actually give them any training as

145
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:37,020
managers and now they're expected to

146
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,510
both manage a team communicate to

147
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:42,090
external teams and still be the

148
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:46,050
technical resource are we the TLDR of my

149
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,210
question is are we setting ourselves up

150
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:50,310
for failure because of our hiring and

151
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:55,800
promoting practices I would say that's a

152
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,650
part of it although it's it's not a one

153
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,090
size fits all and this is just from

154
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:03,300
personal experience I think we don't

155
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,000
focus enough on soft skills when I say

156
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,160
soft skills a large part of that it's

157
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,350
kind of relationship building fostering

158
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,910
relationships being able to communicate

159
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,640
being able to think outside kind of what

160
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,650
our immediate sphere of influences and

161
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,780
what our immediate drivers are I also

162
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,570
think that we're a little bit and

163
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,190
whether it's a leadership thing or

164
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,480
whatever it happens to be that we're a

165
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,450
bit myopic in how we treat teams so

166
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,070
we'll we'll look at the network's team

167
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,870
and say that's your absolute focus

168
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,570
that's your absolute focus your focus is

169
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,430
keep everything up and running to keep

170
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:39,060
the lights on and manage change we'll

171
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,260
look at the infrastructure guys and kind

172
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,060
of say exactly the same of buildings in

173
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,280
time for projects and easier dev team

174
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,900
you need to constantly develop the next

175
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,790
things and you make sure it's built

176
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,680
within that absolutely user focus and

177
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,880
get the latest versions out get

178
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,470
everything up and running and we don't

179
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,530
really look at how all of these things

180
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,680
are actually dependent upon each other

181
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,850
and if we don't recognize the

182
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,890
dependencies we've kind of set in our

183
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:04,080
team's up to fail regardless of who we

184
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,440
put in charge of them and how I've seen

185
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,300
it kind of actually bridge that gap at

186
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,480
times is where individuals have taken it

187
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,490
upon themselves to say do you know what

188
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,890
I'm fed up of just butting heads with

189
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:19,320
other teams it's not so bad as any good

190
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,060
it's detracting me for my day job is

191
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,680
detracting them from their day job and

192
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,720
it's hampering us all from delivering so

193
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,950
let's go and bridge that gap

194
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,950
individually as personal people as human

195
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,810
beings and start to them bridges teams

196
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,360
and start to understand kind of what are

197
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,250
your drivers you development team

198
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,960
networks team security team whichever

199
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,000
team I don't really care what are your

200
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,380
drivers what are you trying to achieve

201
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,649
what are you what's your

202
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:43,119
pipelined look like what's your

203
00:08:43,119 --> 00:08:45,579
day-to-day life like how can I make your

204
00:08:45,579 --> 00:08:47,589
life easier because if I can make your

205
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:49,029
life easier there's a chance that you

206
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,589
might make long in life easier and

207
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:52,119
understand what my driver's are and

208
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:54,160
together we can start to build something

209
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,259
a bit more collaborative that allows us

210
00:08:56,259 --> 00:08:58,300
both to achieve our goals without it's

211
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,740
just banging our heads against each

212
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,550
other

213
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,980
and ended up just spending our days at

214
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,779
work really really frustrated really

215
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:06,100
pissed off and then going home and

216
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,290
feeling the same and a large part of

217
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,999
that's requiring you to put your ego to

218
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:11,829
one side and even working with people

219
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:14,199
that you family dislike I'm just going

220
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:15,519
do you know what I don't care about the

221
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,089
individual I care about the outcome so

222
00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:20,800
you kind of touch on what I was going to

223
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,019
ask you should does not come from

224
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:25,660
management as well as so many aspects so

225
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,819
the one thing I see teams clash in heads

226
00:09:27,819 --> 00:09:30,519
and to me it's kind of crazy to think

227
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:32,559
you work for the same company you should

228
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:34,569
be helping each other because at the end

229
00:09:34,569 --> 00:09:36,189
of the day you trying to achieve the

230
00:09:36,189 --> 00:09:38,850
same goal beards provide a service

231
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:41,199
generate revenue generate profit

232
00:09:41,199 --> 00:09:44,949
whatever so is it perhaps management

233
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:48,220
needs to get involved and try and force

234
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,860
better engagement between teens rather

235
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,879
than an individual level I think I think

236
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:56,410
you can recognize it certainly you can

237
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:57,910
recognize it from a management point of

238
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,819
view I think if you're developing a

239
00:10:00,819 --> 00:10:04,329
culture which is in essence what this is

240
00:10:04,329 --> 00:10:06,670
it's a culture of collaboration whether

241
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,350
you call it DevOps whether you call it

242
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,910
deficit cops whether you call it

243
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,249
actually just teams working together in

244
00:10:12,249 --> 00:10:14,199
the right way so that they each get

245
00:10:14,199 --> 00:10:16,720
mutual benefit and culture for me is

246
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,749
always a groundswell and it works best

247
00:10:19,749 --> 00:10:21,399
when it's people who are actually facing

248
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:23,079
off to each other I think from a

249
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:24,490
management point of view we should

250
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,679
encourage and facilitate provide the

251
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:28,389
mechanisms to do that provide people

252
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:30,069
with a headspace to go and understand

253
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:31,569
the teams they're butting heads with or

254
00:10:31,569 --> 00:10:33,699
even just getting the most demand from

255
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:36,459
even if that demand is you know it's a

256
00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:38,889
very mutual demand it's a very happy

257
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:40,480
demand you work really well with each

258
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,759
other there's just too much of it to

259
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:44,139
actually just encourage them to give

260
00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:45,540
them that headspace to work it through

261
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,429
for me it's always worse back to work

262
00:10:48,429 --> 00:10:50,750
best when the people doing have were

263
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,459
directly with each other and start to

264
00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:54,199
build relationships and we as managers

265
00:10:54,199 --> 00:10:57,589
and leaders can help facilitate really

266
00:10:57,589 --> 00:10:59,180
put it in their hands to actually work

267
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,139
together properly

268
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:01,879
I don't want to push down a culture I

269
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:04,250
want to build a culture upwards so so

270
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,189
add let me ask you a question here a bit

271
00:11:07,189 --> 00:11:09,399
like the question I asked Jess earlier

272
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:12,350
how are you finding it when you you know

273
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,269
for those who don't know you you're in a

274
00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:15,920
business and part your business is

275
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,550
increasing awareness that's develop

276
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,959
collaboration and all that kind of thing

277
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,939
which is what we're all about yeah but

278
00:11:22,939 --> 00:11:24,680
when you go out and do your job

279
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,959
are you finding it easy are you finding

280
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,540
a lot of resistance how are you finding

281
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,029
culture I guess it possibly differs

282
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:36,350
depending on the industry it does depend

283
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:40,129
a little bit generally dog ruff right

284
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:41,750
are gruff and this comes back to the

285
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,430
dislocation even simple things like I

286
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,560
said before that your operations team

287
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,180
and your awareness team don't work

288
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,220
together yes like what if they don't

289
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,050
work together how are you making people

290
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,120
aware of the threats they're facing on a

291
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,910
daily basis this is really simple these

292
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,529
are two teams that work within the same

293
00:11:57,529 --> 00:11:59,439
area that should just talk to each other

294
00:11:59,439 --> 00:12:01,970
and I've seen this in organizations

295
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,680
where the CEO has been there six months

296
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,209
and the CEO has been there you know the

297
00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:08,120
best part of ten years and just seeing

298
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,740
this dislocation that actually hampers

299
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:13,329
things or understanding that kind of

300
00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:15,829
your operations team your security

301
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:17,870
operations team has clear dependencies

302
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,759
on things like your exchange team your

303
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:21,290
network team your infrastructure team

304
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:23,480
your desktops in your AV team and they

305
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,980
don't work with them they've all got a

306
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,050
manual process in place they don't have

307
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,389
the mechanisms in place to work together

308
00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:31,939
which is a cultural thing it's not a

309
00:12:31,939 --> 00:12:33,769
technological thing it's a process and

310
00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:35,720
people thing which is a essentially down

311
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,309
to a cultural thing and that can span

312
00:12:37,309 --> 00:12:40,610
across not only geographies it can span

313
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,829
across organizations into suppliers as

314
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:45,230
well yeah it's a personal thing that

315
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,240
again it's very similar to kind of that

316
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,949
you know whether it's DevOps or whatever

317
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:50,449
you want to call it even working with

318
00:12:50,449 --> 00:12:52,550
suppliers as well is it's giving people

319
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:55,579
the ability to bridge these gaps an

320
00:12:55,579 --> 00:12:57,769
understanding and part of this and this

321
00:12:57,769 --> 00:12:59,660
is where as a leadership side we need to

322
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,389
change our focus and we need to move

323
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:04,080
away from what the industry tell

324
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,030
which is predominately we need that we

325
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,410
need to look at things in a vertical

326
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,570
manner so we need to look at things like

327
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:11,280
education and awareness as a thing in

328
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,840
its own right or we've got a Gartner

329
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,250
right quadrants and we've got a

330
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,870
Forrester wave or we've got a wherever

331
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,970
it happens to be education awareness is

332
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:21,060
a thing in its own right you just know

333
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:24,270
it isn't it isn't at all education and

334
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,840
awareness leads to something else

335
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,860
education there wins haven't gonna wear

336
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,470
workforce is not an outcome it's not an

337
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,750
outcome in any way shape or form if your

338
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:37,590
workforce is aware now what it bleeds

339
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:39,450
into something else maybe they'll spot

340
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,130
things maybe they'll report things also

341
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,930
so you start to bleed into operations

342
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,070
because maybe but I have teams that I

343
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,480
need to look at stuff and it becomes

344
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,730
behavior right it's behavioral its

345
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:50,940
cultural its process its people and it's

346
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,550
technology all conjoined you know when

347
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:56,730
we say PPT they're not three individual

348
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,290
items they're three items that are

349
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:00,450
absolutely conjoined with each other at

350
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:03,720
the hip but we rarely think of them in

351
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,400
that way and our industry is actually

352
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,490
teaches us not to think that way our

353
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,170
industry tells us you need insider

354
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:11,640
threat programs you need awareness

355
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,160
programs our compliance regimes do the

356
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,170
same thing they tell us we need PCI DSS

357
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:18,090
you need an education awareness program

358
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,700
that runs at least once a year and they

359
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,830
break them down into silos yet all the

360
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:25,290
problems we have run horizontal the our

361
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,790
industry teaches us to look at them

362
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,070
vertically and then we wonder why we

363
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:31,380
don't move forwards because we never

364
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,450
understand the joins between them so

365
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,980
we're almost taught to dislocate

366
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,510
ourselves from the actual problem I

367
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,800
couldn't agree more

368
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:42,000
I think operationally I see a lot you

369
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,520
have technical security people and I

370
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,000
consider myself to be one of those where

371
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,270
our focus is on for example the 30 out

372
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,280
of date Debian machines that you've got

373
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,760
over there yeah yeah and you you risk

374
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,500
sessom and go well actually you know the

375
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,760
public facing on the Internet and

376
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,430
therefore they are potentially risky but

377
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:02,970
you're not going to have that

378
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,560
conversation in the boardroom all right

379
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,840
look you're not going to wander into you

380
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,140
CEO or whatever and go look we've got 30

381
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,030
KB machines over there because that is a

382
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:14,040
language that is of no consequence

383
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,440
whatsoever yep absolutely organization

384
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,149
and what do you think when you think

385
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:20,800
about it differently the conversation

386
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,060
that you're then gonna have with your

387
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,339
board or your exec its fatal or whatever

388
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:27,310
is gonna be more like did you know that

389
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:30,519
we have a risk of financial loss and

390
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:32,949
then the question then becomes well why

391
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:34,930
and then we start analyzing the reasons

392
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:37,329
for it which may well be the third

393
00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:40,420
Debbi of machines well our day but

394
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,189
actually when you're managing risk at

395
00:15:42,189 --> 00:15:43,720
that high end of the organization it's

396
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,060
talking about company closure it's

397
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,829
talking about job losses it's talking

398
00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:50,649
about severe penalties from a regulator

399
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:53,829
like the ICL such-and-such reputational

400
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:55,149
harm and all that kind of stuff

401
00:15:55,149 --> 00:15:56,379
operational downtown

402
00:15:56,379 --> 00:15:58,029
those are the kind of conversations that

403
00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:00,339
you are going to have at the xko level

404
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:02,529
of the organization you're never going

405
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:07,600
to bring them an XSS risk that's the

406
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,100
huge disconnect you've got between

407
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,930
operational security on the ground

408
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:14,620
within an org and how that might thread

409
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,480
its way through to an actual material

410
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,610
piece of harm that gets caused them to

411
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,860
the organization I think that's the the

412
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,860
sort of transition or transcendence even

413
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,480
that we need to make in the industry

414
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,319
yeah definitely definitely so and you

415
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:31,300
know it's not the only one as well but

416
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,089
absolutely and when you look at kind of

417
00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:35,980
those machines that you know that are

418
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:39,699
there and are potentially essentially

419
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:42,160
representing a potential risk and

420
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,569
especially the closeness of the internet

421
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,189
etcetera etcetera cetera that kind of

422
00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:46,689
says but there's a reason why they're in

423
00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:48,720
this state in the first place as well

424
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,490
which is generally a people and process

425
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:53,470
side and a budget thing as to why those

426
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,569
machines are in the state they're in

427
00:16:55,569 --> 00:16:57,699
I mean one of the good things is we're

428
00:16:57,699 --> 00:16:58,930
actually aware of them in the first

429
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,309
place when you think about people's

430
00:17:00,309 --> 00:17:01,809
awareness of asset management it's

431
00:17:01,809 --> 00:17:03,759
pretty low let alone the health of those

432
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,559
assets put hey-ho at least were aware of

433
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:07,569
these assets but what actually led them

434
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:08,949
to be in the state there in the first

435
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:09,520
place

436
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,439
because we can look at these and we can

437
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,480
kind of do the elastoplastic which is

438
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,829
either we perhaps when we bring them up

439
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:16,209
to date we take them off the network or

440
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:19,630
segregate and we do whatever but by no

441
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,220
means are they going to be the only ones

442
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:24,699
now by a long shot and there's a reason

443
00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:27,220
why our machines are potentially in the

444
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,148
state they're in

445
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:30,399
in fact there's many reasons and we need

446
00:17:30,399 --> 00:17:31,330
to start digging

447
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,669
these holes to then understand what's

448
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:35,679
our overall picture when we want to have

449
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,360
these discussions in a way that our

450
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,590
board understands let's look at this

451
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:43,299
effectively systemic issue that we have

452
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:45,159
across the entire organization

453
00:17:45,159 --> 00:17:47,710
potentially that leads us to present

454
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,749
risks to the internet that might lead to

455
00:17:49,749 --> 00:17:52,749
financial loss regulatory issues

456
00:17:52,749 --> 00:17:54,940
compliance issues whatever it happens to

457
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,249
be even reputational stuff or or

458
00:17:57,249 --> 00:17:59,919
actually maybe nothing but just running

459
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,960
the risk of something happening that

460
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,850
lets get into this to understand what

461
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:06,129
the systemic risk drivers we have within

462
00:18:06,129 --> 00:18:07,960
the organization because at some point

463
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,090
it's going to bite us most likely an

464
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,519
availability issue most currently we're

465
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:14,710
going to run old antiquated kit we're

466
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:17,499
gonna have a hodgepodge net worth that

467
00:18:17,499 --> 00:18:18,909
just connects all sorts of shite

468
00:18:18,909 --> 00:18:21,249
together with all sorts of ports and

469
00:18:21,249 --> 00:18:23,230
protocols running way beyond the optimal

470
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,419
only necessary stuff only from the you

471
00:18:25,419 --> 00:18:27,159
know day one that we started with once

472
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:29,529
upon a time to thousands and thousands

473
00:18:29,529 --> 00:18:31,869
of rules most of its redundant and to

474
00:18:31,869 --> 00:18:37,059
actually kind of build into why are we

475
00:18:37,059 --> 00:18:39,549
in this state and how can we as a

476
00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:42,129
business move forward and what levers do

477
00:18:42,129 --> 00:18:44,919
we have like digital transformation to

478
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:48,220
actually start to alleviate a lot of the

479
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,320
issues that we have as an industry today

480
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,269
because there are many things we can use

481
00:18:52,269 --> 00:18:55,330
to help us without having to go hook and

482
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:57,970
by crook to try and try and find a way

483
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,559
to get budget try and find a way to

484
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:01,480
admit we don't really know what's going

485
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,249
on and actually come back to that

486
00:19:03,249 --> 00:19:06,070
cultural piece that says if I work with

487
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,269
these people who are driving the new

488
00:19:07,269 --> 00:19:10,419
future maybe I can drive my optimization

489
00:19:10,419 --> 00:19:12,369
and my improvements along the way and

490
00:19:12,369 --> 00:19:14,350
those thirty machines that present a

491
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,299
risk maybe I can put those on the

492
00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:18,070
pipeline to actually move forward and

493
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,200
build the processes that means they

494
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,330
don't go back into that state again yeah

495
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:26,590
I was going to jump in with something

496
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:30,629
that I find that the word digital

497
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:33,369
transformation is being bandied about in

498
00:19:33,369 --> 00:19:35,919
organizations and for the points that

499
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,889
you just kind of outlined and I think

500
00:19:38,889 --> 00:19:42,009
you know it is impossible for some

501
00:19:42,009 --> 00:19:44,100
organizations like Becky point

502
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,500
you know with the legacy technical debt

503
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,650
to to digitally transform and a lot of

504
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:52,350
the times I think this strategy is

505
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:55,789
lacking do you find that the business is

506
00:19:55,789 --> 00:19:58,980
well maybe this is the true point is

507
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,169
that the businesses trajectory and what

508
00:20:01,169 --> 00:20:03,510
they want to accomplish isn't properly

509
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:06,030
articulated in technological terms that

510
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,700
the tech teams can follow and that that

511
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,190
that disconnect is is one of the core

512
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:16,950
issues I think it leads to a core issue

513
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,690
or certainly one that I've seen many

514
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:22,049
times is that you know when you kind of

515
00:20:22,049 --> 00:20:23,909
say to the business what is it you want

516
00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:25,760
to do what is it you want to achieve

517
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,320
it's actually a really hard question to

518
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,390
answer you know you say well what do you

519
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,530
want to do with this data

520
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,500
I wonder what understand it better

521
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,450
Acadia but what do you want to do what

522
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:37,740
do you understand how do you want to

523
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,880
understand it what do you understand

524
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,440
about your customers how do you want to

525
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,690
delve down to need to watch it to

526
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,730
develop what - for what betterment to

527
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:46,500
the organization it's really hard to

528
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,820
actually delve and do that requirement

529
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,710
stuff properly which I think we're

530
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:52,679
generally quite rubbish at but it also

531
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:54,240
needs to us not been able to explain

532
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,710
that and we can't expect the business to

533
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,330
explaining in a technical way but we

534
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:59,010
should interpret into a more technical

535
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:01,020
standard the business strategy into a 90

536
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,520
a digital strategy whatever you want to

537
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,010
call it but I think with that disjoin

538
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:06,690
there we almost end up with a digital

539
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:09,000
strategy that tells the business what it

540
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,870
wants and don't get me wrong one of the

541
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:14,820
big drivers there is that it's very much

542
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:18,179
user focused user driven user led user

543
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:20,190
interaction that security can learn a

544
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:22,559
hell of a lot from because security is

545
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,350
still too far divorced and dislocated

546
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,240
from its end customers from the

547
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,039
customers of security which leaves us

548
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,690
with this massive gap of developing

549
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,190
stuff for security rather than for our

550
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,770
customers but it leaves us with this

551
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:36,690
disjoin there that we're actually not

552
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:39,390
doing a collaborative digital strategy

553
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:41,520
you know you've got security on the

554
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,600
outside of it you've got the business

555
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,370
probably closer than you would expect

556
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,409
you've got different aspects of IT that

557
00:21:46,409 --> 00:21:47,909
aren't as close as they should be

558
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:49,260
pacifica a day job of running the

559
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,909
business running the idea of the

560
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:53,370
business and for a coherent one it comes

561
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:55,740
back to that behavior that culture of an

562
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,520
absolute being

563
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,880
strategy that's driven by all of us that

564
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,430
said this isn't utopia so will it ever

565
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:06,970
happen but we can bridge the gaps to

566
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,200
make it a little bit better than it is

567
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,090
today and that starts with a

568
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:13,000
conversation that starts with leaving

569
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,920
your ego at the door not trying to prove

570
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,320
how big your technical competencies not

571
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,970
trying to prove how much better than

572
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,650
someone you are not trying to prove how

573
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:22,480
much sway you have in the organisation

574
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,070
you can block them and stop them

575
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,870
achieving their goals I'm just going to

576
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,580
know what we need to bloody work

577
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,590
together because if the business is to

578
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,990
thrive we need to collaborate if we

579
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:34,390
collaborate all our lives get easier and

580
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,920
we can actually achieve something really

581
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:40,240
quite special that brother all right ed

582
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,700
your time is up mate thank you very much

583

for having me I've hardly sworn so

584
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,160
people probably won't believe it to me

585
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,210
I was trying to count them out [ __ ]

586
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:52,620
swore and I think it was like twice

587
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,560
you're doing it for charity so I won't

588
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,950
