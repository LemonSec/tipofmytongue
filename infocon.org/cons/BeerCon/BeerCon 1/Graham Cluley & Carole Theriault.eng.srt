15
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,780
think that night

16
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,079
I think Def Con is an entire semester of

17
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:49,079
University including the parties because

18
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,480
we've got a core group of people yeah

19
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,550
basically spinning plates you're keeping

20
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:58,070
everything so so games versus oh sorry

21
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:01,140
how many people how many people are

22
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,329
actually hosting this so how many times

23
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:04,650
do you guys get away from the mic and do

24
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,840
a stretch and stuff have a PE okay

25
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,909

26
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:11,729
are three it was essentially hosting so

27
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:15,840
a right sure on myself bear farmer John

28
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,729
who's got a family and other commitments

29
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:19,920
he's dipped in and out a couple of times

30
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,330
but it's been predominantly the three of

31
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,790
us who say that but I'm pretty sure I

32
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,250
saw John tweeting that he hadn't a party

33
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,990
to go to this notice does a man need

34
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,560
Graham this is the problem there is two

35
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,960
security researchers and all of Belgium

36
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,460
John is totally in demand for any

37
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,759
speaking or party engagement I mean

38
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:50,100
embassies he's had all of the Belgian

39
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,110
Film Institute because you can't have a

40
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,350
posse without an info second okay the

41
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,540

46
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:07,489

47
00:02:07,489 --> 00:02:11,030
I'm wearing special trousers

48
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,100

50
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,940
height from your member down into that

51

caocao to speak right it's all in a good

84
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,160
cause

85
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:20,320
exactly oh good I I have a game here

86

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,990
friend gave me I had a called a my

88
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:35,290
normal anyway I pulled out a few cards

89
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,910
from the games oh this is gonna be

90
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,110
horrendous

91
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,390
now what you guys need to do you can't

92
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,280
show your answers or I just want to make

93
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,710
a tic either on the left or the right on

94
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,240
the way they say it is

95
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,470
let me just I'll read it to you because

96
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,710
it's a bit weird they say as we go

97
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,810
through them decide whether or not you

98
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:56,410
identify with or in any way recognize

99
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:59,470
what is being said if you do right put a

100
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:02,890
check on the right okay okay okay so I'm

101
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,420
sorry so if we recognize it's on the

102
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:04,840
right

103
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,430
if we don't it's on the left that's

104
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,100
right yeah okay you guys can play at

105
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:20,710
home as well I'll tell you I'll tell you

106
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,420
each and every time what you just follow

107
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,950
my lead here okay question number one

108
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,380
question everyone yes I badly want to

109
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:30,670
win triumph and quietly humiliates so if

110
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:33,160
you decide whether it if you just if you

111
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,800
identify with that or recognize it could

112
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,850
it check on the right okay okay question

113
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:43,180
number two in a way that most people

114
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,890
don't realize I'm actually quite amazing

115
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:50,089
[Music]

116
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,460
I suspect my partner might in a way

117
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:08,740
prefer me dead romantic partner or

118
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:12,130
partly you do a podcast with ghosts I

119
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,530
think you could choose grim good let me

120
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:19,180
know mmm he's small and perhaps rather

121
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:22,060
hard to defined ways I think I'm a bit

122
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,960
superior to most people you're

123
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,260
describing Twitter yeah it's just a few

124
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:32,740
minds few more if you might um I often

125
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,910
feel like the

126
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:48,280
least attractive person in the room this

127
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,020
is a good way this is good I find

128
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,510
spending time with my phone more

129
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,840
interesting than interacting with pretty

130
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,800
much anyone you know a friend of mine

131
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,180
has said she looked on her phone she was

132
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,410
nervous by doing this but she looked on

133
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,580
her phone to see how many hours she

134
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,750
spent on our phone a day

135
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:08,410
no what she averaged six hours and she

136
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:10,030
says if someone had asked her she was

137
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:14,080
said to max right Wow yeah okay two more

138
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,870
on my own I sometimes try to increase

139
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:38,530
the length and intensity hello pause on

140
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:41,140
this penultimate card to to ask how you

141
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,790
could actually do both those things at

142
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:45,580
once you know like you guys ring up a

143
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,920
sec you're smart right length and

144
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:57,480
intensity and lots and lots of beans

145
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,980
okay and then the last one in the end

146
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:13,180
porn often seems a lot easier here I

147
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,800
thought the questions were gonna be what

148
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,510
is your mother's made me okay that was

149
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:22,930
ten questions right so okay okay can you

150
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:25,210
guys tell me can you guys tell me the

151
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,820
number of cards in the pot in your on

152
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,740
your right on your right tip which is

153
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,349
yes which is the yes favi agree side

154
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:34,510
yeah so I don't need no ends but just my

155
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,789
goal should go first I'm embarrassed to

156
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:37,000
say

157
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,710
I'll go first but I'm embarrassed to say

158
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:44,600
that I had eight okay okay so so

159
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:50,610
anyway I'm gonna fill it I'm gonna give

160
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,320

161

162
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,680
normal indeed Oh your mind is definitely

163
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,140
get points a little disconcerting but

164
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,120
that's to be expected giving what human

165
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,640

sorry okay so this is for you Graham

173
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,680
your apparent normality is extremely

174
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,020
intense but it appears that your journey

175
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,600
to self-knowledge has not yet begun

176
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:38,640
Oh mr. Miyagi this is this is a card

177
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,710

well there's an answer for you as well

182
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,970
go you're certainly very respectable and

183
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,130
the contents of your mind could almost

184
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,980
be read out in public but the score does

185
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,390
suggest a certain lack of self

186
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:08,070
acceptance in candor hmm that's what I

187
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,350
was around their team I was low actually

188
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,940
that's when I did this I was quite low

189
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,350
so I was like grandma's obviously lying

190
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:18,210
I have I've not been any so the question

191
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:21,240
was around are you normal not what score

192
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,820
did he need to get to be instead of not

193
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,060
normal knowing the school of life yeah I

194
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,860
think not didn't matter I think it's all

195
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,860
normal basically the human nature is so

196
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,570
broad surroundings

197
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:34,620
I thought it would be a lot more

198
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,860
incriminating so thank you Carol see I'm

217

218
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,320
still asleep

219
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,510

Greg basically steals pretty much that's

247
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:39,570
called a muse see well it kind of works

248
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,550

00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:50,790
the Liberace if our duo yeah you didn't

250
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,350

251
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:58,710
cause everyone exactly you see you don't

252

256
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,370
of a backroom girl isn't she

257
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,160
Kroll on the podcast each week and

258
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,410
you're doing your talks and things and I

259
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:18,210
think why the fine you've got quite a

260
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:20,820
following one kardashian-style following

261
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,250
you know so I think someone wants to say

262
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,430
something green Corolla Corollas via the

263
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,070
power behind the throne right just West

264
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:32,100
the porcelain throne yes okay so people

265
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:40,250
call it fact it's interesting isn't it

266
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:44,220
one serious question she was boiling

267
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,910
Graham what Graham Carol what were the

268
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,980
couple of the biggest stories that you

269
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:54,170
covered in 2019 there was the one we did

270
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:56,700
when we were reviewing what Ofcom

271
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,710
were trying to you know they were they

272
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,150
were talking to the people to find out

273
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:03,870
who found what rude and what words

274
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,040
should they ban on

275
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,889
vision before and after nine o'clock Wow

276
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:09,800
and they went around to people on this

277
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,820
do you know I was at a Halloween party

278
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,790
and we were doing a pub quiz and they

279
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,139
said come up with a scary name and the

280
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:17,639
scariest name was Boris Johnson's

281
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:22,560
Johnson which were not even sure how

282
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,630
many children it's produced so the list

283
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:31,079
list from Ofcom was really they would go

284
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,699
up to people in the street and go do you

285
00:14:32,699 --> 00:14:37,529
find beef curtains inappropriate or not

286
00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:44,730
literally oh we've had a disk a mat

287
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,860
that's good yeah we're good we're good

288
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,100
so really this yeah for real and one of

289
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,019
the words I'm not gonna say okay starts

290
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:54,690
with a GE okay and when is it rhymes

291
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:59,759
with hunt okay yes and that is yeah it

292
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:01,199
starts with the G so if you want to if

293
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,420
you want to Google that privately okay

294
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,240
start page it perhaps start page it

295
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,459
opened in room I got work so I'll just

296
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:11,250
run that and see what may be the biggest

297
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:15,470
computer security related story but

298
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:34,079
educator professional educator what's I

299
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,149
think deep fakes I think deep fakes were

300
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:38,579
the big story for me for 2019 the idea

301
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:41,850
and lyrebirds so the idea of like fake

302
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,620
news and I know fake news is now at two

303
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,060
three years old that we've been banding

304
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,639
that word around daily yeah but the I

305
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:49,620
think the idea behind it more than the

306
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:53,040
threat has dissin settled people Allah I

307
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,350
think so yeah deep fab solutely cuz it

308
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,480
but it's sort of dystopian nightmare

309
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,880
material isn't it yeah potential and I

310
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,230
don't know if we're all overreacting to

311
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,089
it but at same time you know we could be

312
00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:04,829
being deep faked right now maybe the

313
00:16:04,829 --> 00:16:07,139
bear farmers well I am you think I know

314
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:09,000
you think I took my Sunday at 3 o'clock

315
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,200
don't get it

316
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,440
I mean we just went through a process of

317
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,540
undying our hair pink after our brief

318
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,089
stint with Cambridge analytic I turned

319
00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:21,240
out to be not our best gig Cambridge

320
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,079
analytical bad con would not call again

321
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:28,980
one star on Yelp it was about experience

322
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,899
it was nearly as bad as b-sides on our

323
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:35,699
butter we'd all that date prey because

324
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:37,019
we've got a deep fake in the bear

325
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:40,860
farmers is now sure because he's

326
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,959
pretending that he's South Africa for

341
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:50,669
win-win right well you are crow Terry oh

00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:57,929
Eastern Oxford UK basically UK who joins

344
00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:00,360
on a weekly basis myself how would you

345
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:05,360
describe me grow your larger-than-life

346
00:18:09,169 --> 00:18:12,600
once named the 11th greatest cyber

347
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,199
Britain

348
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,700
what a t-shirt made he literally he

349
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,080
didn't make a choice he just got an

350
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,030
honorable mention let's tell the truth

351
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:25,210
right top 10 list you me and Alan sugar

352
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:30,429
go honorable mentions got a t-shirt made

353
00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:32,799
I just looked around saying 11 famous

354
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,780
Britain well you know I think I'm it

355
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,270
okay I I think he needs matching

356
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:39,789
t-shirts for security serious awards I

357
00:18:39,789 --> 00:18:43,570
think that would be really popular

358
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,820
bloggers did we mention the name of up

359
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,740
odd customer in that little play it's

360
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,230
called smashing security it is smash

361
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,990
right green thinks it's his show there's

362
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:55,870
marginally more security related content

363
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:58,179
then we have 0 in the last 20 minutes

364
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:00,010
but only marginally there's an awful lot

365
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:03,400
of off-topic stuff yeah but that's kind

366
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,289
of the antidotes of the whole thing

367
00:19:05,289 --> 00:19:07,990
right the fact that you can inject a

368
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,340
little bit a comedy at what we do

369
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,990
because that's kind of why the bear

370
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:13,360
farmers exist yes Oh 100%

371
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,640
you know poke poke for that [ __ ] and try

372
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,020
and get people to stop taking everything

373
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:21,340
so seriously yeah it's easy to be

374
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,440
depressed I remember that time where

375
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,350
Tavis Ormandy told a joke and then 90

376
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:28,330
days later I got the punchline

377
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:36,070
oh not actually was a good joke was it

378
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:39,960
okay I had some inappropriate ones but

379
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,309
today's good question I asked a question

380
00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:45,539
about making security fun yeah okay so

381
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:48,490
don't think so if my mechanic tried to

382
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:51,669
make my car making a my car maintenance

383
00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:57,280
fun I would be really right I'd be like

384
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:03,789
[ __ ] do not have to come here again very

385
00:20:03,789 --> 00:20:06,460
soon I don't need the clown shoes this

386
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,929
is just what me occurred to me I did a

387
00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:09,520
talk a few weeks ago and this was this

388
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,780
was I decided because I was going he's

389
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,890
an independent I could just say what I

390
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:14,080
wanted right so I did and it was it went

391
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,400
down like way I'm very well but it's

392
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,630
true if you did it joke to your car

393
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:22,090
mechanic and he just gave you a grunts

394
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:25,120
you'd be what a miserable gets yes you

395
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,130
know if I made a joke to them and they

396
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:28,310
laughed at it and

397
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,990
I'll throw and do all the tires for free

398
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:32,300
that's when you're talking right yeah

399
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,910
yeah yeah so it's true making a report

400
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,470
probably does really matter because

401
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,540
otherwise but I don't think people

402
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,310
should assume that that security is fun

403
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,810
for most people I think everyone's lives

404
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:44,360
are pretty pretty busy and unless you're

405
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,950
in drinking that you know drinking the

406
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,540
kool-aid every day it's just not

407
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,070
something that you take you take it

408
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,180
seriously you don't want to be educated

409
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,580
in every aspect of it I think we'd be

410
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,020
very smart in our industry to just kind

411
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,970
of bring it down to the basics cuz 80/20

412
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:57,440
right if they do two things that are

413
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,760
better than they did before they're way

414
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,360
safer yeah just to FA just have to FA

415
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,340
and have people just password my hygiene

416
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,500
just start there make that your 20/20

417
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,500
yeah absolutely and what a fantastic way

418
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,660
to end on a security topic there you go

419
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,980
