search ads news and research division

12
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:42,809
within Microsoft so I have an

13
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:46,440
opportunity to do and see a lot of crazy

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,829
things with a global scale of Internet

15
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:55,620
right so you know how everyone fits

16
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,629
there and says they talk about Google

17
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:00,030
and you know everyone wants to go Google

18
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:05,250
I sort of kind of say well no gain you

19
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,570
know and and yeah so that's that's what

20
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,490
my background is that's where I work and

21
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,909
what I do on a day-by-day basis

22
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,479
and yeah so we first met at the Diana

23
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,030
initiative a couple years ago yeah so I

24
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,340
will want to talk about the Diana

25
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,560
initiative because you know you're kind

26
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,290
of representing them here on beer column

27
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,490
one but I do want to start maybe with

28
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:35,360
Microsoft now a huge investment

29
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,210
Microsoft has made in security across

30
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:43,619
the board as your platform being sort of

31
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:47,880
I would say at the evolution of you know

32
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,689
all sorts of security layers and

33
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:54,960
security capability are right are you

34
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,930
are you migrating the products that

35
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,790
you're sort of responsible forward to

36
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,340
that is your platform or they already on

37
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,549
them yeah that's a great question right

38
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:10,258
so for example the areas that I work

39
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:10,830
with

40
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,370
which are search as a new spaces they

41
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,220
they have you know a pretty significant

42
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,560
infrastructure worldwide right they have

43
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,470
regional deployments in the US and

44
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,020
Europe we got presents and various

45
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,840
nations for the regulatory controls

46
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,140
needs you know presidents in India in

47
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,810
China right what not just here as well

48
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,170
as Australian and you know we have

49
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,410
coverage you know worldwide for research

50
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,540
as well as for the capabilities that we

51
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,060
provide for you know our other platforms

52
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,670
like office and Shore right so that

53
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,320
infrastructure has been around for a

54
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,120
good decade right and that was the

55
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,800
original original original right

56
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,959
incarnations of what you now see as the

57
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:00,900
modern evolutions of measure platforms

58
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,330
and the service fabric and the substrate

59
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,340
that builds up the graphs that we have

60
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,250
you know today right so you know we're

61
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,050
sort of kind of like you know victims of

62
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,780
our own success there's like you know we

63
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,430
have all these new capabilities that are

64
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,709
now available in Azure so we want to

65
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:18,390
take advantage of that well that means

66
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:22,170
we have the library parts of our search

67
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,870
platform up to that new platform as well

68
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,730
and some things are already there like

69
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,190
ads and rewards you know I love rewards

70
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,860
you know I kept hats on my xbox and on

71
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,300
my phone and everything else right and

72
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,340
that's a lot of fun for me right turn

73
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,410
that right around and you you know you

74
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,630
know benefits as well right that I can

75
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,090
give to you know things like the Diane

76
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,209
initiatives and other charities like you

77
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:48,090
know this enough right for example all

78
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:50,820
right so you know there's there's a lot

79
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,670
of you know work that we do to put stuff

80
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,160
and move stuff or new stuff or new

81
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,410
development on adjure today because we

82
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,890
get a lot of benefit from scale and

83
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,700
regionalization right that you know

84
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,600
enterprises get as well you know so can

85
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,420
we a lot of our platform is just raw

86
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:13,260
confused right that mat-based

87
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,600
compute you know that's really highly

88
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,289
performant and and optimize for for you

89
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:22,440
know indexing the world's internet right

90
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,280
so yeah that's that's you know a lot of

91
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,810
what we do and that and then you know

92
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,630
for the the security of those things

93
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,010
right is like meaning if you think about

94
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,650
it from the perspective of you know we

95
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,630
do a lot of advertising you know and and

96
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,300
we made sure that those ads go out to

97
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,250
those people and and there's there's a

98
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,320
lot that we need to make sure to protect

99
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,169
the the data and the integrity of you

100
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:48,750
know how we address you know when

101
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,539
Windows ads pop up and how they pop up

102
00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:53,729
and make sure they're contextually aware

103
00:04:53,729 --> 00:04:57,330
based on what you search and making sure

104
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,680
that we're we're not taking into account

105
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,520
the personalization right we're we take

106
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,050
a lot of work enough for an interview

107
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:08,340
making sure that you know we protect the

108
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,720
the user session and profile

109
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,090
almost fanatical like it's a new

110
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:20,460
religion across the the company and ever

111
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,870
since gdpr we've we've we go above and

112
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,910
beyond to include that as you know you

113
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,560
probably heard it like a Microsoft trust

114
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,360
promise that's right

115
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,880
right and and you know there there's a

116
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,590
lot that goes behind that everything

117
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,570
down to you know separate identities for

118
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,729
things with production and making sure

119
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:40,340
there's you know full authorization

120
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,550
chains for everything and you know you

121
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,400
know we encrypt every bit of customer

122
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,520
data you know that the are entrusted

123
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,060
with um so there's a lot that goes

124
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,280
behind that and the audit controls that

125
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,710
support all that right so you know

126
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,270
there's a lot to think about with that

127
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:03,030
you know and then oh by the way you know

128
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,620
how do we build those new experiences

129
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,979
how do we build those new things that we

130
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:09,690
want to go do with our research and

131
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:12,000
things like our cognitive services and

132
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,880
those api's that drive you know new

133
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,130
machine learning and you know making

134
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:18,870
sure that those things don't have

135
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,390
inherent bugs when we ship those api's

136
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:25,349
for things like the data modeling and

137
00:06:25,349 --> 00:06:29,159
data visualization you know a is that

138
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:31,320
are being develop a you know bot

139
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,840
frameworks and

140
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,900
experiences you know we were bringing

141
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,669
with customers and the scenario

142
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:41,159
different into us with as well right

143
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:45,569
it's it's amazing right for example

144
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:46,860
right I mean some of the some of the fun

145
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,479
things that I get to play with is you

146
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,529
know everything from IOT devices using

147
00:06:52,529 --> 00:06:55,469
as your sphere all the way up to you

148
00:06:55,469 --> 00:06:58,860
know saying hi to a plant in my office

149
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,199
when I walk in anymore

150
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:04,889
um so it's it's it's you know crazy

151
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:06,840
being part of that research part of the

152
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,139
company that also has you know that

153
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:12,930
fundamental core root that building from

154
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,689
the beginning right I mean Bing was a

155
00:07:15,689 --> 00:07:18,020
research project way back in the day and

156
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:22,729
that that whole you know researcher

157
00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:27,529
culture is very well rated not met

158
00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:30,210
that's really really cool so you can

159
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:32,279
confirm at this point that there is no

160
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:36,089
longer any front page extensions being

161
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:41,270
used now that I'm aware of

162
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:45,449
good news yeah yeah but you know it's

163
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:47,759
interesting because Microsoft has a long

164
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,759
and and some people would say challenged

165
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:54,719
history with introduction of new new

166
00:07:54,719 --> 00:08:00,360
technology and that you know there are

167
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,050
folks that argue that the dotnet

168
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:06,389
ecosystem is is more difficult to

169
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:11,490
accomplish things at scale how do you

170
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,449
respond to folks that are sort of like

171
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:18,839
feel that open source is is you know the

172
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:25,379
only solution um I don't know I that's

173
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:29,370
sort of kind of like look for example

174
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,750
I haven't had the company for 20 years

175
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,820
let's start with that right

176
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:37,700
and I started back when when you know

177
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,870
there wasn't even this thing that we

178
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,179
called open source right it really was

179
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:45,330
before you know this whole concept was

180
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,790
really you know being published as that

181
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,890
one seminal paper called the cathedral

182
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:52,380
in the bazaar right and if you haven't

183
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,240
read or heard about that I'd suggest you

184
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:54,990
go check that out

185
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,830
yeah right and and here we are you know

186
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:01,560
25 years later if you will almost right

187
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,910
because you know back then I was working

188
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:06,170
you know in college with with flatware

189
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:11,940
3.1 yeah from this guy who Linus who was

190
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,000
you know whole freaking you know oh my

191
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,830
god what what the hell is this guy doing

192
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:20,550
taking hp-ux and and and and and other

193
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:23,430
unix systems and building it for 386 TC

194
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:27,150
yeah okay let's run it right that was

195
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,310
that was our mindset right and this was

196
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:32,460
me pre pre pre Microsoft right when I

197
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,440
was still touring with the dead during

198
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,150
college and hanging out with Rolling

199
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:39,990
Stone magazine you know my internship

200
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:43,290
right but you know fast forward 20 20

201
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:46,560
years 25 years now and you know the

202
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,680
bazaar is in the cathedral yeah right if

203
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,880
you really think about it right now

204
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,170
it's adopting you know a lot of the old

205
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:57,570
mechanisms that the Cathedral has had as

206
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,250
part of its old admin so we're seeing

207
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,380
this this evolution across open source

208
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,580
and we're seeing that happening across

209
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,220
enterprise customers and we have the

210
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,589
same problem as you know search ads and

211
00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:10,320
news businesses we have all this open

212
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,750
source and we're using and consuming

213
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,070
open source and we're leveraging those

214
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:16,440
those those modules and components right

215
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,750
and and and contributing back in a

216
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,060
variety we're not just from last but but

217
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,560
from research right we could be sure get

218
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,970
a lot of things that you go check that

219
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,550
out right it's all out there all of our

220
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:29,220
samples I mean all of dotnet core is now

221
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,010
out there on github right just knock

222
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,080
yourself out leave the code compiling

223
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,700
you can go work it if you want right and

224
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:42,089
you know the exposures all better so the

225
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:42,870
argument that it's

226
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,540
complicated well I mean if you grew up

227
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,180
with it like me it's easy right I've

228
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,890
always had Visual Studio I've always had

229
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,350
BS code I've always had PowerShell it

230
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,820
was always at my fingertips I know I

231
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:58,950
grew up understanding the the hardware

232
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,850
abstraction layer for Windows right and

233
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:04,589
meanwhile everyone outside that scope

234
00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:06,750
was learning the same thing in UNIX

235
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,290
right right but right at some point

236
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:12,150
somewhere along the lines I remember

237
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:15,210
being there at one meeting where one of

238
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,250
our executives you know point-blank

239
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,680
asked who was here whatever want to feed

240
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:25,350
sequel a minutes yeah it was a hushed

241
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:28,470
silence and I was only one of three

242
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,210
people who raised my hand I looked up

243
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:32,339
and I looked around 5,000 people in the

244
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:34,950
room all internal Microsoft people I was

245
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,210
only one of the three people who raised

246
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:39,600
my hand and I can hear this guy say okay

247
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,820
okay we've got a long way to go right

248
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,339
yeah here we are 2019 and what are we

249
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:47,459
doing announcing friggin sequel on Linux

250
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:49,230
and you know hey you know if you want

251
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,790
Linux on the desktop just install

252
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:53,459
Windows 10 K it's right there with ya

253
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:55,650
with Terminal Server right and you know

254
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,959
all the packages are available I can run

255
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,900
docker from it I can run all my life I

256
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:04,920
was there maybe that's a funny story

257
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,200
right we can run calif on it but guess

258
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,540
what happens when I install it in my my

259
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,150
domain at work I get a phone call from

260
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,650
my friends over to the cyber defense

261
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,839
operations that are saying hey Raoul

262
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,060
what are you doing downloading Kali we

263
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,550
just saw you go do that and they're

264
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,720
getting that through the defender

265
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,760
telemetry data right those are also main

266
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,070
joint in tune and all that and I'm like

267
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,380
dude that's creepy don't do that to me

268
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,120
right I'd sit right next to you guys

269
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,779
every day you know we can do that

270
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:35,880
amongst our security folks but guess

271
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,560
what if we do that to one of our end

272
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:43,709
users they get freaked out right so we

273
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:46,200
take that very seriously and we want to

274
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,029
be responsible with what they do with

275
00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:50,400
that and even more so when it comes to

276
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,110
our customers data

277
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:55,140
and we fight like cats and dogs inside

278
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,820
the company but when it comes to our

279
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,430
customers don't dare come after us

280
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,170
because we will fight even harder right

281
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:03,420
we fight really hard to make sure that

282
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,829
we protect that data we're doing the

283
00:13:04,829 --> 00:13:06,740
right thing to protected and secure it

284
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:10,860
and and you know the incidents that have

285
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,600
happened over the past couple years with

286
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,220
data leaks and and you know supply chain

287
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:20,750
some gaps and social media companies and

288
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,700
research companies I mean that to me

289
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,380
that that came really close to heart

290
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,910
right I mean being sort of you know the

291
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,670
Microsoft Research Division no you know

292
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,649
what if one of our researchers is

293
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:33,510
working with some some you know

294
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,420
educational institution and

295
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:38,459
inadvertently has some some customer

296
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:42,240
data right well you know thankfully you

297
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,730
know I I spent the last you know five

298
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,709
six years working through making sure

299
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:48,510
that we have full accountability of the

300
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:51,420
data provenance and lineage right which

301
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,519
you know I mean you're gonna that's that

302
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,190
make sure that you know what kind of

303
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:58,010
data do we have right GDP are

304
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:00,329
fundamentally change everything that we

305
00:14:00,329 --> 00:14:02,100
do and how we look at data and what we

306
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,019
think is customer data what we think is

307
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:09,060
personal data and and and really up the

308
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,820
ante in terms of you know the the

309
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,550
impacting implications for the

310
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,899
responsibilities that we have as

311
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:18,540
Microsoft because yeah I mean Facebook

312
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,790
might have you know whatever their

313
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,829
consumers and Twitter might have and all

314
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:24,779
their their users and all that but you

315
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:30,199
know as Microsoft right I mean we have

316
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:33,300
really the the added impact of having to

317
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,610
deal with the infrastructure of not just

318
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,829
you know almost every customer and

319
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:40,380
enterprise across the u.s. most

320
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,959
potentially the world yeah manic league

321
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,060
nation states right and so that puts us

322
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:48,709
at a better at a serious you know

323
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:51,089
heightened watch and that will be you

324
00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:55,140
know work effort that we have to do

325
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,420
there that the protect us and a lot of

326
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,339
hours and a lot of investments to make

327
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:02,490
sure that you know we we need to fund

328
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:04,740
against you know all adversaries

329
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,190
you know both horn and

330
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:09,310
lovely I want to move though because

331
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:11,230
we've got about five minutes yeah you

332
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:14,290
take the passion of your of your career

333
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:17,740
and your recent work with Microsoft and

334
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,899
you're pouring that passion into the

335
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:22,389
Diana initiative what do people you need

336
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:24,519
to know about the Diana initiative and

337
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:27,069
why is it so important if they an

338
00:15:27,069 --> 00:15:28,930
initial is a great initiative to help

339
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:32,850
bring new talent into the security anity

340
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:35,490
that haven't had those opportunities

341
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:38,199
available to them particularly in women

342
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:40,540
and people of color I believe that you

343
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:44,410
know it's a great way to give an

344
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:48,209
opportunity to them in a safe place

345
00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:52,600
where they can share and learn and work

346
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,750
and get exposure to the same type of

347
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,399
technologies and then for me that's

348
00:15:57,399 --> 00:15:59,680
that's really important because if it

349
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,170
helps build you know that that talent

350
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:05,740
formal is you know that everybody is

351
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,050
looking for talent and and the type of

352
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,759
talent that we need to bring into the

353
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,819
the marketplace is more than just you

354
00:16:12,819 --> 00:16:15,550
know hey if you need women but we need

355
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:18,250
else off folks you know of not just

356
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:22,120
women but you know you know people of

357
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,550
all all ethnicities and if you think

358
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,769
about it Microsoft is a global company

359
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:28,990
right and you think about it from you

360

362
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:38,050
right and there's there's how we look at

363
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:39,610
that and how we hire for those people

364
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:42,189
here and and the work we're doing to

365
00:16:42,189 --> 00:16:44,709

374
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,520
exposure to the training and the

375
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,069
resources so that we can bring those

376
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:16,148
talents and that perspective into our

377
00:17:16,148 --> 00:17:17,720
engineering into

378
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,519
our security perspective because you

379

those things that you know as we look

381
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,089
forward in the future with with more

382
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:28,549
machine learning and the perspective of

383
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:30,590
data bias you know bringing in that

384
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,929
diverse perspectives right women and

385
00:17:32,929 --> 00:17:34,669
people of color is going to be critical

386
00:17:34,669 --> 00:17:36,919
and the Securities to be able to ask the

387
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:38,539
right questions about how are we

388
00:17:38,539 --> 00:17:41,149
handling you know the personal data how

389

390
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,769
the bias rather we're recognizing that

391
00:17:45,769 --> 00:17:48,490
bias in those data sets making sure that

392
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:51,889
we're being responsible ombudsman with

393

396
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:03,620
values and you know as a company as well

397
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,620
for it um so these are the same things

398
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:10,279
that we're dealing with you know at a

399
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:12,169
macro level but you know things that we

400
00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:15,500

407
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:35,240
we've been given huge huge opportunities

408
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,730
and then super lucky to get into a

409
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,529
company like like where I'm at at

410
00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:42,830
Microsoft and it's a damn freaking shame

411
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,509
that we don't take that back out to the

412
00:18:44,509 --> 00:18:48,429
world and give back you know all those

413
00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:50,840
that's been given back to me right and

414
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,019
so you know I I look at that as my

415
00:18:54,019 --> 00:18:57,909
outlet to go and help bring you know

416
00:18:57,909 --> 00:19:01,039
help make that space happen right so

417
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,860
more than just dreams right because you

418
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,419
know let's let's face it dreams are

419
00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:06,039
lives

420
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:08,929
it's the dreaming that's real right cuz

421
00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:10,639
I know that love in the dream it will

422
00:19:10,639 --> 00:19:15,009
never come true so nice and food

423
00:19:15,009 --> 00:19:18,620
Dianna's though been expanding this this

424
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:22,250
year was I think what were the numbers

425
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,529
because it's been growing ever since and

426
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:26,330
it grew to the point now where it's

427
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:27,680
almost become

428
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,910
a convention unto itself yeah I was I

429
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:35,360
was really really amazed right when when

430
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,490
I first you know join them a couple

431
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:38,630
years ago right

432
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:42,920
um they had gotten a penthouse suite

433
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:47,270
right and yeah we had we had them there

434
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:50,450
nine hundred people lined up outside in

435
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:54,590
the hallway like you guys got to do

436
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,720
something like yeah we know we're trying

437
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,570
to push them out inland and it was crazy

438
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:04,520
right so we had a packed you know set of

439
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,440
fashion you know and even in that little

440
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,770
space I mean we realized there was so

441
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,870
much pent-up demand even on day one

442
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:16,000
right um that it was just impossible to

443
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,950
fathom right and then you know last year

444
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:21,050
they moved over to the Westin and and

445
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:23,810
ended up expanding those to the capacity

446
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:25,970
that could handle almost three thousand

447
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:29,030
any time my understanding is that they

448
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:31,790
had a really great session fortunately

449
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:34,250
wasn't able to participate a lot during

450
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:37,580
that week but I know that they had you

451
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:40,130
know some great CPF up there and saw

452
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:44,360
them doing soldering they have they had

453
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,830
their own badge and yeah I mean it was

454
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,810
it was essentially a mini conference

455
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:50,690
right there alongside Def Con in its own

456
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:53,480
right and they had you know a lot of

457
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,150
great success with with driving that and

458
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:58,820
I was I was really you know you know a

459
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,860
bit boom myself to see it from afar but

460
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,270

461
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:04,280

00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,140
they had right it was it was awesome

463
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:11,390
from my perspective and I'm looking

464
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:12,560

465
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,100
