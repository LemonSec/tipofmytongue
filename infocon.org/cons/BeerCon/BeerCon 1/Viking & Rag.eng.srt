dudes yeah and also part parcel of the

8
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:26,460
engineering team behind what we're doing

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,490
tonight and it was a last-minute hassle

10
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,940
and me talking so part why this is

11
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,790
working at all is down to these guys so

12
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:42,329
thanks be to them I know but you chaps

13
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:46,680
what you want to talk about well I guess

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,820
what we all start about and really

15
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,340
intelligence and stuff like that the fun

16
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,149
stuff awesome yeah so suppose you should

17
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:55,590
probably introduce yourselves yeah you

18
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:00,390
want to go for a break yeah so um unlike

19
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,469
the other people have been on so far

20
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:02,760
knew where to the industry

21
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,489
affectionately I've got my fast InfoSec

22
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,220
job in June so a couple months now and

23
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,600
that's in the aviation industry

24
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,450
specifically and sort of threat hunting

25
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,070
and looking for vulnerabilities

26
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,650
throughout the aviation sector so that's

27
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,310
yeah that's who I am

28
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,409
that's kind of where you want Boerner

29
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:21,600
abilities to be found right yeah yeah in

30
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,220
the aviation industry

31
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,049
cuz that's in the skies well I'm sorry

32
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:30,509
Viking I have a beard I drink beer and

33
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:32,579
that's all I think I'm legally allowed

34
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:39,329
to say for now I'm not sure they could

35
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:45,540
be quickness we wrestles wrote kind of

36
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,640
security researchers we do intelligence

37
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,890
based research and security research so

38
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,170
we do intend to have a crazy background

39
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,790
and some crazy stories that we come

40
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:56,189
across mainly this year long like 20 my

41
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:59,640
feed for us has been crazy like it's

42
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,619
being from tracking school shooters to

43
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:04,350
find mass amounts of vulnerabilities and

44
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,409
systems all over the world at the 8th ah

45
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:09,389
right take a story go ahead and start

46
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:13,129
should we start with the not so long

47
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,460
we actually have an image to put up on

48
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,640
the screen so we want to show everyone

49
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,460
this this image

50
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,230
for context is mag my father was

51
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,660
disabled so every time he loves rocket

52
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,640
to those space servings a space launch I

53
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,870
sit there and I watch the rocket launch

54
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,390
as well so this hot Pacific day I sit

55
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,890
there watching the SpaceX launch and I

56
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,780
think wow I wonder is anyone ever

57
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,940
pentest at the rocket I'm sure people

58
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,390
have you know what it'd be amazing to be

59
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:45,120
able to pentester rocket so forcing it

60
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,709
straight Twitter I was like oh wonder if

61
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:48,090
anywhere ever pentester rocket let me

62
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,550
talk to you about this okay rikes first

63
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,290
response back was there give me a second

64
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,709
let's hop one shoulder right condom you

65
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:56,400
can't be doing that

66
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,060
especially not where at me of course we

67
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,100
followed up with what was hopping on

68
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,920
Sheldon and but six hours later the

69
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,950
images of yet we have to contact NASA so

70
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,910
that's kind of stuff we got bigger than

71
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:15,780
watch world world shenanigans for you so

72
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,850
vulnerable systems right now I'm just

73
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:23,580
like anonymous FTP and for 240 devices

74
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:34,830
exploring yeah so the bear farmers a few

75
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,570
months ago were asked to contribute to a

76
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:40,549
Forbes article about NASA being hacked

77
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,080
got taken down and then for about three

78
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,730
weeks after everyone had screenshots of

79
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,230
between and what's that thing is them

80
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,959
yeah this was pretty hilarious yeah well

81
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,130
it's not just that like we do what our

82
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:04,769
mass amounts the frizzy bits research

83
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:06,690
our favor at the moment secret tracking

84
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,030
people down I absolutely love it there

85
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,290
Olson is my bag

86
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,340
not just ocean for all-source

87
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,350
intelligence in general rag is very

88
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,030
similar it as well so yeah it comes out

89
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,200
like what constantly challenged where

90
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,548
people like to find them like anywhere

91
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:19,918
points in the world like Jenny Radcliffe

92
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,079
is when the rate recent ones I did that

93
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,750
was ago when I was in London rag for

94
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,740
example a photo right Pope and Facebook

95
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,560
basically told me to find Reich and took

96
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,240
me all of us I was like treatments in

97
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,510
total

98
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,580
yeah if the five-minute mark was what I

99
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,020
actually got you on the phone and called

100
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,890
your hotel room that was so are you

101
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,750
telling us in other words if we value

102
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:50,630
your privacy just mean generally I'm

103
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,100
always amazed invented stuff that people

104
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,200
post online that especially comes down

105
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,060
to like selfies like I don't know how

106
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,830
many selfies I see friends pop and pitch

107
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,080
their car keys in the background like

108
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,670
people thought were always go yeah it's

109
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,750
just a car keys what can you do that

110
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,640
like three years ago when I started

111
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,530
college first we were treaty printing

112
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:10,090
keys that will work through the locks so

113
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:13,040
it tends to get a fancier it tends to

114
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,390
get pretty scary start seeing nothing

115
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,650
and see what people are actually posting

116
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,210
online people don't realize what they're

117
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:20,240
posting there every bit of data you can

118
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,940
gather is intelligence and how do we

119
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,620
make people aware of this because I mean

120
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,450
that's it's by the sounds of it every

121
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:30,040
day photos it's something like our place

122
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,390
especially my family would place so how

123
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:35,870
do you make people aware of it like well

124
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,370
I'm student recently with this tripwire

125
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,590
article the obstacle and it's literally

126
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,450
just about raising awareness making

127
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:42,920
people aware that frankly if you might

128
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,120
look at pitch and think it's innocent

129
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,680
and all this stuff but what your allies

130
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,630
is in the reflection of me glasses is I

131
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,990
don't know a post number often you can

132
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,160
now work out where that person is on

133
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,100
that room like yeah one Pacific one I

134
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,530
did with that was a for a research of

135
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,200
mine I goes by alain de blanc and friend

136
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,540
of mine from college as well yeah it's

137
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,000
good good okay and we did a whole

138
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,770
basically around you stickers of his

139
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,150
laptop and i was able to track him down

140
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,620
based on the stickers to his facebook

141
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,380
page and from there as if then basically

142
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,630
following across dublin city using live

143
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:18,050
webcams so I was able to track him from

144
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,730
like Temple Bar straight up a Carla

145
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:20,900
straight across common street to his bus

146
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,260
stop

147
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,640
kneeling in once I know his bus stop I

148
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,620
know his bus route once after know how

149
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,850
many stops he goes and he gets off the

150
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,920
bus then again he's a VC everyday

151
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,750
talkable so we know how long he's on the

152
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,160
bus I just calculate that time for

153
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,690
release from the camera once point the

154
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:33,920
time he gets off and I've got a solid

155
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,070
year of his area we've stained that's

156
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,600
when stuff starts getting really scary

157
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,220
people don't realize the information of

158
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:40,440
what

159
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,780
out there it's very hard specially

160
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,530
people with me

161
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:46,110
who will see information everywhere so I

162
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,310
see intelligence and absolutely

163
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,630
everything that's given to me

164
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,010
everything from type of beer you're

165
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,140
drinking to even recently Maccabees

166
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,430
bunker there's stuff that was in his

167
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,980
bunker and like on such as if people

168
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,660
overlooked it like when he picked up his

169
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,070
camera from anyhow thought but twisted

170
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,900
it around people love her look what was

171
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,000
in the room like I'll strip I say it

172
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,900
right now because I'm in the middle of

173
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,340
writing a blog post like a top soon like

174
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:11,250
he had a good dance coverage the chair

175
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,290
type all of them very Pacific countries

176
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,210
if you add them all up you get a solid

177
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:18,180
here whereas bunker is boss like it's

178
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,000
been another great example power sockets

179
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,170
I mean one of the key things like the

180
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,490
McDonald's Cup for example was the fact

181
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,020
that it was and and you can tell by the

182
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,940
the size of the cup that it was it was

183
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,590
very similar like a UK large size

184
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,570
non-american there was a difference

185
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,730
there so that rules out America straight

186
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:39,060
away yeah you know you can start digging

187
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,580
down into where it is I've got a

188
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:45,990
question for you Barry and what you do

189
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,180
what you've described there is like

190
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,630
super super interesting and actually

191
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:54,450
really fascinating from a nosy bastard

192
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:59,570
point of view but I'm trying to just get

193
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:02,070
to a point where we understand what the

194
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:04,380
risk profile is to individuals from this

195
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:08,160
kind of stuff so on the one hand my mom

196
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,660
was probably not going to be a victim of

197
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,630
what you you guys are doing yeah yeah

198
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:16,380
well I should hope she isn't anyway so

199
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,970
what's your audience for this kind of

200
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,790
knowledge and this kind of advice I

201
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,320
think I know the answer but for the

202
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,360
benefit of the people listening where

203
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,980
are you aiming this kind of work and

204
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,260
this this research and stuff that you do

205
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:31,020
so I do it more as a hobby now than

206
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,120
anything else yeah so when I do I tend

207
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,070
to try share what I've learned over

208
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,839
doing this is a hobby to everyone around

209
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:39,270
me so I'll always tell people okay when

210
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,919
you come down to house effect nor people

211
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,870
the best way I get describe is a friend

212
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,310
of mine from college post on Facebook

213
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,780
where he where he got his new apartment

214
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,150
in Dublin City yeah had a great view of

215
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,190
the bridge and it was overlooking the

216
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,360
bridge and who's going to work for

217
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,500
drinks and stuff like that then that was

218
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,000
great

219
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,680
some replied back straight with Oh

220
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,330
awesome that tell me where it is I'll

221
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,620
come over I'll meet you there we go for

222
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,690
lunch before you work oh yeah I'm at 14

223
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:02,120
B so many people would sit there I go

224
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,650
that's just a standard post on Facebook

225
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,480
I'm sick I go hang on a second

226
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,030
how many buildings overlook the bridge

227
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:10,040
and that part open how many would have

228
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,080
14 apartments in it especially when it

229
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,360
would need to be B or a that's been one

230
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,640
so I've no idea where he is where his

231
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,920
apartment is I also then have a solid

232
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,330
idea how long he's gonna be away so if

233
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,980
I'm a criminal or a burglar I want to

234
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,930
break in I know know how long he's gone

235
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,460
away from his apartment I know for

236
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,660
fighters that drink this was good

237
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,770
Chinese gonna come back and knee brace

238
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:30,370
have to deal and I have to deal with

239
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,720
that is the way I look at this

240
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,850
intelligence everywhere and not everyone

241
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,350
knows what they're doing a post online

242
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,420
everything from even the way you type is

243
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,950
intelligence there so you can gather

244
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:42,530
bait you can like break them people suck

245
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:43,730
accounts if they're fake accounts online

246
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,800
they're dummy accounts easily by header

247
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,710
typing like people for me I use three

248
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,480
dots a lot I use three dots a lot when

249
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,950
I'm typing it's a big space between the

250
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,110
cards if I do that in your else people

251
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,510
in recognize that straightaway when I'm

252
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,070
typing because it's in a second part I

253
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,570
mean there's been situations when I've

254
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,250
been doing like beginning to me and

255
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,210
Viking have just been starting a voice

256
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,470
channel would be looking at Old Post

257
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:07,340
like I've had and of course of Dean's up

258
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,720
and you can see the same sort of

259
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,190
sentence structure and it hasn't changed

260
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:14,870
so you can instantly identify even as a

261
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:17,780
different username on like 10 or so

262
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,550
years ago it's you can tell it's the

263
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,680
same person

264
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,470
sure yeah it's interesting because it

265
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,660
for what you've just described and you

266
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,070
know what you're talking about general

267
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,560
there are clearly roles for the pair of

268
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:36,950
you in my head intelligence analysis

269
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:40,430
yeah and certainly in the sort of the

270
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:46,280
mi6 GCHQ Rena it tells me also that

271
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:50,540
OPSEC for actual like undercover

272
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:54,770
operators you see confidential

273
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:58,430
informants and intelligence services is

274
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:01,990
becoming almost well nearly impossible

275
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:05,870
yeah I read in in this society the

276
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:09,529
only concern I have is guys like what

277
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:13,010
happens if you know the techniques and

278
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:17,410
stuff like that or applied to you know

279
00:11:17,529 --> 00:11:22,370
targets that you know are basically like

280
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,200
if that if the bad guys

281
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,600
so are we entering in a realm where

282
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,170
there's counter-surveillance

283
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:32,570
opportunities massively it's it's a

284
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:34,130
massive concern I understand exactly

285
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,270
where you're coming from with that cuz I

286
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,080
taught them myself

287
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,820
what if posters weren't lying some

288
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,020
guests might be F hi threw themselves

289
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,480
against someone else yeah I think that's

290
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,650
a massive concern because you're

291
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,779
breaking massive amounts of upset like

292
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:46,670
either website called pre-trip or just

293
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,800
the basic breakup SEC it's only for like

294
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,720
it was only CTF client for me so I can

295
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,460
it should be like oh yeah this is all

296
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,450
the tools I possibly need in one place

297
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,970
if I go on there I can be I need and

298
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,920
quickly just to do this i-i've always

299
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,540
sat and topical what's the what some

300
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:02,060
really bad guts out access to this what

301
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,440
same time I'm thinking it's like okay

302
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,240
what's the good guys see this first okay

303
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,830
they all know exactly how I found him

304
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,450
what how I got to this point they'll

305
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:10,520
know how to protect themselves I mean

306
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,570
there was an incident wasn't there

307
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,400
recently about the person who would

308
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,529
extrapolate pictures from someone's

309
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:17,270
classes and use that information to

310
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,529
stalk and then eventually was it

311
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,930
mattered they got murdered no wasn't was

312
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:22,700
it moment massively wounded though yeah

313
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,410
it critically wounded no I actually

314
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,089
talked with that weeks beforehand but

315
00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:28,190
doing that in VC I actually have a blog

316
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,690
post up talking about how to do it

317
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:35,330
actually I think I was down after that

318
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,740
news article dropped because obviously

319
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:41,870
it's the same techniques yeah III guess

320
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:44,709
there's a very much a parallel between

321
00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:47,779
that kind of thinking and the thinking

322
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:50,990
of online and testing I mean it's the

323
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:53,810
train has to hack something yeah

324
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,700
obviously make them more secure but the

325
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,320
bad guys can use that as well as the

326
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,820
tools to do bad things

327
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,220
yeah yeah definitely what do the problem

328
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,350
is I'm not balance everything these days

329
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,970
everything is connected that's the

330
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,589
problem so people are connecting their

331
00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:07,850
Facebook's that are Instagram or

332
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,560
instagram through our Twitter connect

333
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,250
and everything everywhere

334
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,350
so we're realizing they think oh yeah

335
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,209
it's great it's handy but they're

336
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:15,890
connecting their whole life so every is

337
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,930
connecting so if I want to find you from

338
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:18,540
your

339
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,550
we'll find your Facebook I come when I

340
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,840
need to do the tops I show my tinder

00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,130
profile I'm like well this is how you

342
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:25,020
can stop me from my tinder profile of

343
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,130
course I don't have to tender profile

344
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:29,390
anymore anymore for anyone out there

345
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,050
that's good news

346
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:38,670
yeah you know like I have I still have

347
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,530
that as an example like okay well it has

348
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:43,110
basic information' my name my age where

349
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,080
is an educated education where i worked

350
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,640
pretty straightforward if i searched out

351
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,930
a simple google Thorp i can pull up my

352
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:51,330
facebook profile yeah i'm trying for air

353
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,740
i've got images of myself which i can

354
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,180
pull up my home address from the

355
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,980
background so I see where I live five a

356
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,990
selfie at my house the car I Drive if I

357
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:58,890
the picture of my car

358
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,420
it's just case of building up that

359
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,640
profile now when it comes in fits in for

360
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,620
information it could be there as simple

361
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,960
as one little word or a name or a simple

362
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,730
location and you can break someone's

363
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,580
mass amounts OPSEC yeah it's I mean we

364
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,230
saw that during the address up CTF

365
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,300
didn't work yeah activating from one

366
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,310
person's account to a family member and

367
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,840
then to an alternate account for example

368
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,200
yeah so it's all a single comment so

369
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,630
like the amount of information that you

370
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,180
guys can get was limited access to a lot

371
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,010
of things like Facebook and that is kind

372
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:31,830
of alarming so do you think that like

373
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,080
illustrates just how powerful companies

374
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,330
like Facebook and Google are like the

375
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:38,010
amount of data that they can have on

376
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,970
people I in a way I think it's beautiful

377
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:43,290
it's as scares is I think it's actually

378
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:44,820
beautiful to have that much intelligence

379
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,130
I always had this argument for a long

380
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,960
time where people say oh having Facebook

381
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,580
it's bad for your security where I'm

382
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,900
sitting here going well I've worked I've

383
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,190
done stuff at race that's a lot of time

384
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:55,620
trace of CTF I've helped find and locate

385
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,810
missing people are suicidal people and

386
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:00,090
help prevent suicides true information

387
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:02,130
they put on Facebook I'm fine I see

388
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,960
Facebook I was a really good OPSEC

389
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,730
having it there because at the end of

390
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:06,990
day if something happens you at your

391
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:11,310
timeline I know at the same time if you

392
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,720
have intelligence sitting up there and

393
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,890
somebody else is come along and gone oh

394
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,360
yeah I can get everything I want from

395
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,070
this person yeah how's that done so it

396
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:19,920
also has a positive side I think one of

397
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,170
the problems here inviting us a really

398
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:26,820
an example about using OSINT as a force

399
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,540
for good right so you're able to trace

400
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,980
an individual down with the fact

401
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,840
the bridge at any given time thinking

402
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,090
about killing themselves and maybe maybe

403
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:39,300
preventing that from happening and that

404
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,240
is wonderful really you know the

405
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,310
opportunity there is fantastic and I

406
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,350
think we hear about that enough because

407
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,420
the reason we don't hear about it enough

408
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,700
is because of an example that we hear

409
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,250
about too much and you know all about

410
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,700
this one this is about Junaid Hussain

411
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,850
okay

412
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:59,700
so yeah this is trick the guy that was

413
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,920
the head of the cyber caliphate in terms

414
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,560
of Isis you know he was running all

415
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,030
their online operations or our

416
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,950
propaganda recruitment and all that kind

417
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:10,620
of stuff and it's precisely everything

418
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,330
that you guys have spoken about that led

419
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:15,270
to his demise indeed yeah it was it was

420
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,700
about people doing the work that you

421
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,670
guys do that led to again Langley or

422
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:23,100
somewhere over in a remote location with

423
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,730
a joystick in his hand firing a Hellfire

424
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,470
down from the skies that blew him away

425
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:31,800
and killed it that makes the news and

426
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,050
that's all about using a hosting and

427
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:35,490
technology and all that kind of stuff

428
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:39,000
generally for a war related outcome but

429
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,080
I don't think we're here enough about

430
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,640
the other reasons why it's great and

431
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,990
that's kind of the thing I'm strategies

432
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:45,680
out about what the use cases are for it

433
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,150
well I think to you like if you read a

434
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,190
lot of the cyber criminal indictments

435
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:53,490
where the cyber criminals have tried to

436
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:56,610
practice rudimentary OPSEC but the

437
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:59,370
investigators the FBI and the

438
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:02,040
specialists have figured out their

439
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,710
dastardly their their plans

440
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:08,819
you know and again this is all about you

441
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,859
know where to look and how to look and

442
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:13,859
then you know apply technology and data

443
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:16,890
science to it and all of a sudden we now

444
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:20,760
know that bitcoin is not an anonymous

445
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,660
currency in fact the United States as a

446
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:28,500
result of the Huayra botnet guys now

447
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,950
have a way of tracing the creation of

448
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:35,550
Bitcoin what it was used to buy to an

449
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:39,330
email account to an individual yeah so

450
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,650
we're living in a world where I think

451
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,470
you know what what cyber Viking and

452
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,480
ragga are really talking about

453
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,899
the idea that this is a technique a tool

454
00:17:48,899 --> 00:17:50,610
a service if you will

455
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:53,610
OSI int as a service can be applied for

456
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:56,640
really positive things it can also be

457
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,370
applied for really negative things yeah

458
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,640
no completely agree so okay

459
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,470
in the couple of minutes we've got left

460
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:07,110
guys what are you up to next what's the

461
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:10,340
next year or six months lot like for you

462
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,840
for me I can't really answer that I

463
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,250
don't know I don't know way it's gonna

464
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,230
go at the moment but I don't know I

465
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,580
think my first purchase will be a drone

466
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:21,570
if I get some way together I think was

467
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:30,240
an MC catcher as well we need I can't

468
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,240
see can't say I don't know the way

469
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,299
things are went into a nineteen I hope

470
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:38,039
it doesn't go bad but it could go better

471
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:40,110
than is it if it goes better the hell

472
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,779
like it's gonna be amazing

473
00:18:41,779 --> 00:18:43,889
2019 this year for me has been

474
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:45,419
absolutely spectacular especially

475
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:46,860
increasing my career increasing my

476
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,840
knowledge helping as many feels like I'm

477
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,250
the world just make that bit of a

478
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:54,380
difference yeah but you know we you gone

479
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:59,850
well work I mean it's recently I've been

480
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:01,019
able to start doing a bit more

481
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:05,580
professionally and and that's great and

482
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,529
it's probably carried on with that I'm

483
00:19:07,529 --> 00:19:09,029
trying to get maybe into stuff like the

484
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:11,820
Treadstone car and can treat allergens

485
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,909
courses that type of stuff and yeah just

486
00:19:14,909 --> 00:19:17,549
cracking on carrying on what we've been

487
00:19:17,549 --> 00:19:20,309
doing this year really really that's

488
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:22,679
cool whole thing I would say is that

489
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:24,450
keep doing what you're doing but keep

490
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:27,470
keeping the light side of the force

491
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:32,100
yeah to quickly add we want to beat our

492
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,169
record on the trail of CCF we need

493
00:19:34,169 --> 00:19:44,789
20,000 points annual card I believe he's

494
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:47,389
doing it this year

495
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,159
I've known these two chaps for quite a

496
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:57,309
while and they really are incredibly

497
00:19:57,309 --> 00:19:59,440
impressive and you know if they talk

498
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,499
about they live and breathe and you know

499
00:20:02,499 --> 00:20:06,479
a lot of people missing people cases of

500
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:08,829
stuff that we can talk about we've been

501
00:20:08,829 --> 00:20:10,299
involved I've been a little bit involved

502
00:20:10,299 --> 00:20:12,579
in as well helping people have actually

503
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:17,259
hacked investigate those cases it's a

504
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:18,549
lot of good work that doesn't really

505
00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:20,229
come to light because of you know the

506
00:20:20,229 --> 00:20:22,649
sensitivity of it but but rest assured

507
00:20:22,649 --> 00:20:25,149
they're on the right side and doing

508
00:20:25,149 --> 00:20:28,359
stuff that's this helping people and

509
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:31,329
it's things like that I know a lot of it

510
00:20:31,329 --> 00:20:34,479
we can't share but at least share some

511
00:20:34,479 --> 00:20:35,139
of it

512
00:20:35,139 --> 00:20:39,489
whether it's a normal house as much as

513
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:41,529
possible because as we've heard tonight

514
00:20:41,529 --> 00:20:44,049
has been a lot of negativity Fox said

515
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:46,869
its toxicity around the infestation so

516
00:20:46,869 --> 00:20:48,969
trying to elevate these things like the

517
00:20:48,969 --> 00:20:50,859
work these two are doing I think already

518
00:20:50,859 --> 00:20:53,409
helped my industry as a whole to

519
00:20:53,409 --> 00:21:05,919
offering a focus on negative we hope at

520
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:15,999
some point research for months

521
00:21:15,999 --> 00:21:32,919
investigating yes for me it goes back to

522
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:33,999
me as a child wearing the Superman

523
00:21:33,999 --> 00:21:35,469
costume gone I wanna make a difference

524
00:21:35,469 --> 00:21:37,179
in the world and it's still this today I

525
00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:38,349
still feel like I where I thought you

526
00:21:38,349 --> 00:21:39,459
might help people and to make a

527
00:21:39,459 --> 00:21:41,529
difference mmm I don't I don't care

528
00:21:41,529 --> 00:21:41,979
about the money

529
00:21:41,979 --> 00:21:44,289
as I said before I can live on minimum

530
00:21:44,289 --> 00:21:46,119
wage would be happy as long as I don't

531
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:50,139
make my difference the world that sounds

532
00:21:50,139 --> 00:21:53,609
like here thank you
