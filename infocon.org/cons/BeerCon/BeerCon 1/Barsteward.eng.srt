1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,619
good evening good evening

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,019
welcome aboard thank you would you mind

3
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:12,179
just giving a little intro tell us who

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,610
you are what you do

5
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:17,580
okay well I'm at the other end of the

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,310
InfoSec side I'm focusing on the

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,490
embedded security side so I work for a

8
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,710
semiconductor manufacturer and I'm

9
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,439
looking at side channel analysis and

10
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,180
fault injection and and that's sort of

11
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,829
end of things but there's a lot of

12
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:37,440
commonality in terms of developers

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,329
needing to be aware of these sorts of

14
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,309
risks and these things not being taught

15
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:45,750
there's a lot of fair a lot of things

16
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,640
that are quite common whether you're

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,829
talking about the application security

18
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:53,449
level or security at the lowest levels

19
00:00:53,449 --> 00:00:56,129
so in your case I guess you work on

20
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:59,460
hardware devices and things perhaps

21
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,289
people have in their homes or in their

22
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:06,119
businesses well yeah we sell chips and

23
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:07,710
customers use them for various things

24
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,070
but it's predominantly automotive and

25
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,960
industrial and IOT devices so yeah

26
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,420
there's we have a large range of

27
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,400
customer requirements but for different

28
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,240
products and to a certain extent that

29
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,710
means that we are we have to try and

30
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,549
help the customers maintain security and

31
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,770
different customers have different

32
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:36,720
opinions of what they need so that yeah

33
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,420
this is quite a big difference so I got

34
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,439
into this from embedded software

35
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,250
engineering background so it's a physics

36
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,030
degree and then software for about 10

37
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,409
years and then I I got into the security

38
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:57,180
side of things through podcasts

39
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,360
originally and then I moved to a

40
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,180
smartcard group and spent some time

41
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,040
writing secure boot loaders and

42
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:10,580
specking systems for smart metering that

43
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,510
sort of thing and then I decided to make

44
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,580
it a bit more formal and a master's in

45
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,910
information security so that's that's

46
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,970
kind of how I got into in Passaic you're

47
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,920
probably the most qualified person in

48
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,690
the room yes syndrome a because you've

49
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:33,200
got some incredible guests and me now

50
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,500
you're know so I want to ask a question

51
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,900
though because we hear in the media and

52
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,180
a name for sector press about you know

53
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,880
Internet of Things security and and how

54
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,849
you know vulnerable things are etc etc

55
00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:50,330
from your perspective are things getting

56
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:53,420
better are the are your efforts sort of

57
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,360
coming to fruition in a more secure base

58
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,180
hardware level you may be secure boot

59
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,530
loader is that a really a thing now so

60
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,510
most of the ski boot loaders are on the

61
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,130
higher end devices this is the issue

62
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:09,920
that security cost money and if you're

63
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,549
selling you know very cheap devices then

64
00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:16,190
people don't care about how what the

65
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,140
security is like and if you if you make

66
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,660
a chip that has all the bells and

67
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,819
whistles that you need for security

68
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:24,290
that's that's great but if no one's

69
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,540
gonna buy it that's that's not gonna fly

70
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,480
so yeah it's it's a hard problem to

71
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,650
solve

72
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,870
but yeah certainly we're definitely

73
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,730
seeing moves in the right direction so

74
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,560
more of the lower end customers

75
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,760
definitely looking for security and

76
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,120
willing to spend you know invest time

77
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,480
and money in making things right the

78
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,850
standards are helping in that regard

79
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,489
unfortunately this that's the University

80
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:54,680
and is this so many to choose from so

81
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,630
there's a lot of competing standards in

82
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:00,859
the in the IOT solid even so arm have

83
00:04:00,859 --> 00:04:05,989
their own PSA assess it there's a lot of

84
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:09,000
different standards which could

85
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,790
possibly make a difference but with so

86
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,620
many to choose from no one's sort of

87
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,488
backing it's a funny word isn't it

88
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:20,160
because Makaha ponine came out with

89
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,360
Mikko law which yes he prescribed it

90
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,610
himself which was I think along the

91
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,280
lines of when anything is described as

92
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,990
smart it's vulnerable by definition

93
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:35,520
since I get a good rule of thumb yeah

94
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,970
and it makes sense and I find and you

95
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:40,140
know I've been up a lot of talks in the

96
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:43,110
UK in the past couple years and you've

97
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,850
seen like the guys at Penn test partners

98
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,580
that have been hacking sex toys and

99
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:51,570
ships and eerie systems and basically

100
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,030
anything that's got a chip in it and any

101
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,670
kind of level of intelligence and going

102
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,200
back to your point about making it cheap

103
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,830
and then forsaking security you don't

104
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:05,070
need to see too many kind of butt plugs

105
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,140
and build those that have caused

106
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,270
damaging harm to an individual because

107
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,450
they've got hacked or cloud pets the

108
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,400
thing that Troy hunt goes on about quite

109
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,810
a lot where your kids information and

110
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,520
the videos of your children audio

111
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,660
recordings of your children are on

112
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,610
online in buckets that can be hacked and

113
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,620
all that kind of stuff how much more of

114
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,479
that does it take before manufacturers

115
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:31,260
are actually seriously forced into doing

116
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,690
the right thing and yeah stopping

117
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,490
constipating the issue and started put

118
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,860
security first so I think there's some

119
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,560
things that could change currently how

120
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,960
does a consumer know which products are

121
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,540
secure so if you say it's gone buy

122
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,660
something from you know any big retailer

123
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,330
online for example there's nothing there

124
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:53,870
that allows a consumer to have that

125
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,240
knowledge of whether this is a decent

126
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,760
bit of kit or something rubbish so

127
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,120
there's there's some movement towards

128
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,900
standardization and I think that if if

129
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,460
we get an influential retailer saying no

130
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,960
before you're allowed to sell your kit

131
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,590
on here we need you to jump through some

132
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:20,010
hoops like they're doing that in the

133
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,650
state of California right

134
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,639
where there's gonna be an IOT minimum

135
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,650
requirement change default password yeah

136
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:30,139
I mean this there's a lot of these moves

137
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:33,770
afoot but it's still all in the planning

138
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,470
stages in a lot of places at the moment

139
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:40,820
I can see there's some where the barrier

140
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,710
to entry is quite low so the very first

141
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,949
level is self certification so they just

142
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:48,710
have to pay a nominal fee

143
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,680
quite quite low in figures and fill out

144
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,530
a questionnaire that way the text boxes

145
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:56,960
that says yes we've considered XYZ you

146
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,639
know all they all the standard sort of

147
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,530
things and that we you know we're not we

148
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,780
don't have shared passwords that could

149
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,539
link to a class break scenario although

150
00:07:05,539 --> 00:07:08,389
such things and then that allows them to

151
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:13,190
use a level 1 logo on the retail side so

152
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:16,060
you could have a traffic light system

153
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,580
yet with energy efficiency what do you

154
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,410
what about the argument that there's

155
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:25,789
plenty of compensating controls in a

156
00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:29,720
properly implemented IOT environment so

157
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,510
ok I'll give you an example simple IP

158
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:35,510
tables or firewall rule that says the

159
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:38,199
device is allowed to send data to a

160
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:43,220
particular IP address end of but yet

161
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,620
when we talk about the vulnerability of

162
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,270
the device we're making the assumption

163
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,740
that we're just putting this thing

164
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,080
directly on the internet with no

165
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,800
compensating controls whatsoever not you

166
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,240
know going through the process of

167
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,610
changing default passwords like at some

168
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,909
point the manufacturers must be pretty

169
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:05,720
frustrated that the threat model is like

170
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,330
this thing alone no infrastructure no

171
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:11,000
monitoring no logging you know just

172
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,389
sitting out there yeah that's that's a

173
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:15,889
problem that I don't think is gonna be

174
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:18,349
solved for the IOT sort of side of

175
00:08:18,349 --> 00:08:20,330
things because unless you're gonna

176
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:24,159
explain how to configure phones my dad

177
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,779
remain but only on automated if it's

178
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:33,260
different but who puts a DVR or IP TV

179
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,120
cameras directly on the

180
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,448
rather than segmenting them off and

181
00:08:37,448 --> 00:08:39,649
locking that down in an enterprise

182
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:42,438
scenario I am I going to be surprised by

183
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,179
the amount of people that actually just

184
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:45,920
fling it out there and put it on the

185
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,220
Wi-Fi and call it a day it I guess a lot

186
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,559
of that particularly with the CCTV type

187
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:54,620
systems and DVRs it depends on who

188
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,930
you're in stories as well they've

189
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:59,660
increasingly these devices are now

190
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:03,290
coming with their own 4G access that

191
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,300
maybe bypasses some of those controls

192
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:10,069
yeah I was like how do we get consumers

193
00:09:10,069 --> 00:09:13,730
to follow basic security advice home

194
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:16,730
which has been a really good example you

195
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,050
get one half of a box they have a

196
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,499
default password especially with a

197
00:09:20,499 --> 00:09:24,199
wireless changing that the password

198
00:09:24,199 --> 00:09:25,610
associated to what who are less and

199
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,699
human changing the SSID it's not too

200
00:09:28,699 --> 00:09:30,920
difficult I'm sure many people would be

201
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,199
able to do it set around instructions

202
00:09:33,199 --> 00:09:35,689
and doing that means you're going to

203
00:09:35,689 --> 00:09:38,569
immediately raise that bar significant

204
00:09:38,569 --> 00:09:40,610
enough there attackers are probably

205
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,079
going to lose interest in their husband

206
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:45,879
so how do we get messages like that to

207
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:49,160
non-technical people like as soon as you

208
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,649
borrow this and plug it in do this yeah

209
00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:53,749
well some some of that can be mitigated

210
00:09:53,749 --> 00:09:56,240
by making sure that for example in the

211
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,279
devices you have unique ID so they can

212
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:00,649
be used for key derivation so you can

213
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:03,259
have you don't need the consumer to do

214
00:10:03,259 --> 00:10:05,839
that but they just read it off the the

215
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,939
card that comes in the box that this is

216
00:10:07,939 --> 00:10:11,269
what their password is and that's unique

217
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:14,209
to them it's a default password for all

218
00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:17,600
devices for example yeah I mean yeah

219
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,059
most of most of the work I do is is not

220
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:22,850
on the IOT so it's so we're sort of

221
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,230
trying to test the security of our

222
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:28,339
devices so we have crypto accelerators

223
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:32,569
and things so in those you're looking to

224
00:10:32,569 --> 00:10:36,949
see if you can recover the key so so I'm

225
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:39,829
diffusing electromagnetic emissions from

226
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:42,529
the chip whilst it's encrypting to try

227
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:45,019
and to see if if we can recover the key

228
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,570
from the device and then

229
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,060
testing the countermeasures that prevent

230
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,850
that sort of thing from happening can I

231
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,640
ask a question about around disclosure

232
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,520
so it might not be something that you

233
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,360
get directly involved in but we do see

234
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,270
hardware vendors producing equipment bit

235
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,220
fire being an example that's the only

236
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,760
time I'm gonna mention it or the third

237
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,840
time this evening

238
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,910
oh is it the third time I'm making no

239
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:18,580
unhackable claims but that product did

240
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:22,480
exist and it can be the set claims but

241
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,370
the question really is around disclosure

242
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:27,430
so on the one hand you get manufacturers

243
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:31,720
that will go yeah okay we said it was

244
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,520
this and it isn't and thank you for your

245
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,380
feedback and we're gonna fix it deal

246
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,330
with it there is an example sorry use

247
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,280
another sex toy but [ __ ] cam did that

248
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:43,570
okay and then on the other hand you get

249
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,280
the other company that I'm not going to

250
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,710
mention again let's say no our product

251
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,510
is completely unhackable and we defy you

252
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:53,500
to what's the right approach which how

253
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,000
do you think vendors should really be

254
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,740
responding to this kind of stuff when

255
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,840
the community reacts really quickly and

256
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,920
says no you're wrong and here's why

257
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,080
what's the right approach it's if there

258
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,790
aren't currently any standards in terms

259
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:13,870
of standards well yeah the PISA kind of

260
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:19,780
is a useful guidance there basically

261
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,860
people have got to not shoot the

262
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,280
messenger

263
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,370
I mean I'm I I have handled security

264
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:27,970
disclosures myself and reporting that up

265
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:31,450
the chain management results in some you

266
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,250
know who is this person why they're

267
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,460
attacking a device type questions that's

268
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,130
the wrong attitude to be we need to you

269
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,900
know make sure that we understand the

270
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,630
problem and then the you know what needs

271
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,910
to be done to resolve it and who we need

272
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:49,360
to tell about it so it's something that

273
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,070
needs to change in the organization

274
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,250
that's producing the whatever it is

275
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,410
whether it's hardware

276
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:59,230
the product whatever level of security

277
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:03,340
is close you talking about the biggest

278
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:07,090
issue I think that I face with these

279
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:11,200
sorts of things is where the progress

280
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,410
moves on so people's expectations change

281
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,630
and yet when that device was released

282
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,070
there was no expectation this was

283
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:21,670
outside of the threat model but you know

284
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:24,580
clearly equipment to hack things gets

285
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,580
cheaper and easier to obtain more people

286
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:31,390
can can do things more capably with less

287
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:36,160
money and so suddenly these things

288
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,290
become a more distinct possibility and

289
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:41,340
even though it wasn't in the original

290
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,480
remit of protection for this type of

291
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:49,240
device it still looks bad yeah so kind

292
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,900
of adding to that so one thing we see

293
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,550
quite often is hey we found this

294
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,320
vulnerability and the vendors immediate

295
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,570
reaction is oh that's all device we're

296
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:03,690
not only supported so we know yeah so

297
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:06,280
like you should there be a minimum time

298
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,160
period that vendors will have to adhere

299
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,580
and support you and if so what should so

300
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,980
I want to make a point that eventually

301
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,070
like 10 or 12 years later after the ssl

302
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:20,740
standard changes you can't log into it

303
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,280
anymore

304
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,350
just to be clear like some of these

305
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:25,030
devices the last door on this side

306
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,460
saying hey click here to borrow Amazon

307
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,000
yeah

308
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:36,060
[Laughter]

309
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:43,330
the invite to join was open yeah I mean

310
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,860
these are gonna be problems you know how

311
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,170
long does a company have to support a

312
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:49,870
product for particularly if things have

313
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:52,090
moved on and they have products which

314
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,430
have greater levels of security and so I

315
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:56,050
think ultimately there's probably going

316
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:58,480
to be some form of you know a EU

317
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,520
regulations or whatever wherever you are

318
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,800
in the world this at some point the laws

319
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,950
will catch up consumer laws but that's

320
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,690
very consumer and what happens with you

321
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:09,880
know business-to-business and

322
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,650
yeah there's various issues with that so

323
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:17,290
yeah it's not a problem I I can say I

324
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:19,600
have an answer so I think in conclusion

325
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,230
with certainly in the enterprise you

326
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:25,120
could pick a provider whether it's DVR

327
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,910
IP to IP cameras and all that kind of

328
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,380
stuff and that's not your neck of the

329
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,720
woods per se but there are things and

330
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,890
decisions that you can make yourself

331
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:36,070
that kind of limit your risk of

332
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:39,250
compromise so if you are doing a CCTV

333
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,310
system in your company then I don't know

334
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:45,130
segment the network away yeah don't make

335
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:47,529
your cameras easily enumerable for

336
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:51,339
example I do stuff like that so I guess

337
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:53,110
the point I'm making here is that you

338
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:55,510
it's not entirely incumbent on a vendor

339
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,600
to do the right things that are also in

340
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,320
control so that you can put in place

341
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:05,710
itself the the IOT security foundation

342
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:08,290
has some really good guidance free free

343
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:10,630
downloads white papers frameworks and

344
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:15,339
things that IOT vendors can use which if

345
00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:17,260
they were to follow those

346
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,790
recommendations then I think a lot of

347
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:24,779
these problems would be mitigated I

348
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:28,060
guess what's the guy's like sometimes I

349
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,550
view the vendors actually using oh well

350
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,870
we're not going to fix it because it's

351
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:34,180
odd and that's an excuse rather than

352
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:38,130
investing the time and effort to fix it

353
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,050
what does the consumer do when the

354
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:46,720
business is no longer trading or issues

355
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,209
later it's a different company yeah

356
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:52,060
that's it's always gonna remain as a

357
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:56,140
problem so I mean I'm looking at the

358
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:00,610
very lowest levels of chips so trying to

359
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:03,310
try and break them and a lot of it it's

360
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:06,640
also things like trying to break

361
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,740
flattery protection and those sorts of

362
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,920
things a fault injection attacks where

363
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,470
you've got perfect code bug free but you

364
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,329
can induce a fault that causes the code

365
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:19,480
to be vulnerable so you know you can

366
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,429
it's all very well having a you know

367
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:23,290
hardware it of trust and doing your

368
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:25,030
secure boot and checking the signature

369
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,160
but if you can bypass that if-else check

370
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,140
you know did the signature match or not

371
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:33,400
did the hash match then that's that's

372
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,470
another way of bypassing these things

373
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:40,240
yeah I think from a from a customer's

374
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,950
point of view or you know someone

375
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,510
writing code for a device you should

376
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,460
always assume that your code will be

377
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,530
read at some point and understood with

378
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,090
things like guitro making that a lot

379
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:51,340
easier these days so don't rely on the

380
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,310
security by obscurity don't have your

381
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:59,050
your crowd API keys such that they can

382
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:02,020
be someone can attack one device and get

383
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,590
your API key and make mischief on online

384
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:08,710
yeah search words yeah absolutely agree

385
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,360
with that okay we've got a couple of

386
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,660
minutes left and I feel a bit [ __ ]

387
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,640
ecology vast you and really like to know

388
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,040
what your real name is very absurd

389
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,010
that's entirely up to you what you're

390
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,720
gonna be doing in the next year give us

391
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,980
a flavor of some of the work that you're

392
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,650
gonna be looking at I think a lot of

393
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:28,590
what I'm gonna be doing is trying to

394
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:31,270
bridge the gap between the security

395
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:34,210
group and the the hardware design and

396
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:38,890
the application side so a lot of that is

397
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:44,460
gonna be education within my company and

398
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:47,560
there's a lot of standard stuff going on

399
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,170
at the moment as automated standards ISO

400
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,850
to one four three fours coming out which

401
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:55,690
is which were somewhat involved in and

402
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:58,690
that's gonna force at least

403
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:01,180
consideration of some of these physical

404
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:05,200
attacks in the automotive sphere so

405
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,600
there's a lot of process and procedures

406
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,420
stuff to kind of marry up the automotive

407
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:15,040
from the industrial ISO standards so

408
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,810
yeah I think as well as device

409
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:20,170
evaluations so yeah looking to break

410
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:22,390
more devices and get them fixed before

411
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:25,650
they go out the door make sure that

412
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:28,510
design is is good so I'm getting more

413
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,760
and more involved in the architecture I

414
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,430
wrap the chain of designs

415
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,370
earlier in the process

416
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:38,520
really sounds fascinating again somebody

417
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,720
else doing a job that's far more

418
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,440
interesting than the one I do but thank

419
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,120
you very much indeed feeds are really

420
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,430
really good stuff thank you very much

421
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:50,780
yeah thanks a lot Mike
