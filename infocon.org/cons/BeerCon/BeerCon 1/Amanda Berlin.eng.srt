00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,660
just switch with each other and see if

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,779

9
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:29,039
different accent a little bit yeah well

10
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,640
welcome so much I mean there are maybe a

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,739
few people in the industry that don't

12
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:36,420
know who you are so why don't you just

13
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,489
sort of tell tell us quickly

14
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:40,290
yeah I'm assuming there's a lot of them

15
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,170
I'm not sure why you use legend but I

16
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:50,879
appreciate it I'm in a very very tiny

17
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,730
town in Ohio and a lot of defensive

18
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,309
security stuff my day job

19
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,260
the CEO of mental health yeah which is

20
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,960
one of our charities which we would urge

21
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,990
you since we have the CEO of mental

22
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,610
health hackers here we would urge you to

23
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:24,060
donate to beer Conn one so Amanda I mean

24
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,490
obviously you know a bit of a personal

25
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,130
story here about why mental health

26
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,090
hackers but maybe take us through why

27
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,840
you decided that people in information

28
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,009
security need mental health how hell

29
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:46,320
yeah so I I took it on just as a small

30
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,409
talk at first straight so I had been

31
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:53,540
talking a while about like my own

32
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,189
anxiety and depression issues just like

33
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:58,170
with people on Twitter and Facebook and

34
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,909
stuff and at conferences and the first

35
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:04,860
keynote I ever gave was at b-sides

36
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,098
Nashville a few years ago and I was

37
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:10,709
looking for kind of a big picture TED

38
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:12,900
type ish talk right

39
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,110
and I it was around the same time

40
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,090
somebody had come up to me and been like

41
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,629
oh well you seem really happy like you

42
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:25,049
don't look depressed at all so I got it

43
00:02:25,049 --> 00:02:27,810
in my head like you know I've [ __ ]

44
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,849
other people in the industry that have

45
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:32,190
mental health issues I wonder if this is

46
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,920
a thing so I started looking into it

47
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,819
more and realized that in stem in

48
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:41,400
general and then you know Infosys is

49
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,000
included in that there are an increased

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,299
amount of mental health issues compared

51
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:53,250
to like the general public so I gave my

52
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:57,299
first keynote ever and it was I was it

53
00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:03,150
called hackers hugs and drugs mental

54
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,670
health and InfoSec all right and it kind

55
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:09,480
of just covered like I I mentioned

56
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,159
everywhere I go and every time I can

57
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:13,200
that right I I work in defensive

58
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,970
security I'm not a psychologist and a

59
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:18,000
psychiatrist and my therapist I took

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
like one site class in college like I

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,950
obviously am NOT a professional when it

62
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,139
comes to that but I do have a whole lot

63
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:27,959
of personal experience right and know

64
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,900
what I've gone through so it kind of

65
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,989
just went over my personal struggles

66
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:37,620
some base information from like some

67
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,269
really reputable sources and then I did

68
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:44,730
a whole lot of reading on other people's

69
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:49,790
mental health research right and that

70
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:53,040
I've given more than any other talk ever

71
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,379
which I never expected I thought it

72
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:58,079
would kind of be a one-and-done but

73
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:01,590
after the response I just realized it

74
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,060
was helping more people than I thought

75
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,989
it would with just letting other people

76
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:09,480
know that they're not the only ones out

77
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,889
there that are struggling cuz I thought

78
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:12,750
I was for the longest time you know I

79
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,269
thought yeah I can handle this myself I

80
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:18,209
don't need to talk about it I don't need

81
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:20,160
therapy I don't need medication I don't

82
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,709
even think about it I'm just not like

83
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:24,870
shove all those emotions down inside

84
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:25,830
where they're suppose

85
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:29,789
to be and it kind of just snowballed

86
00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:30,680
from there

87
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,270
it's so great because I think it's

88
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,539
bringing to light a really difficult

89
00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:39,569
subject and I think anyone that is sort

90
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:41,430
of new to it kind of needs to be

91
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,289
prepared for the tool that it's gonna

92
00:04:43,289 --> 00:04:46,409
take but then those of us that have been

93
00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:48,569
there for a while it's now given us sort

94
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:52,710
of a bit of a rallying cry / common area

95
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,139
to start talking about and I know that

96
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:57,419
you do a lot of travel you do a lot of

97
00:04:57,419 --> 00:04:59,310
international travel on this subject

98
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:03,539
area are you thinking about a book or

99
00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:06,870
are you thinking about workshops what

100
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:10,020
what is sort of the next evolution so

101
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:15,270
definitely not a book I did that work

102
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,889
and so is this

103
00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:24,060
so I profit because last year I gave my

104
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,279
first workshop like ever right and it

105
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:28,680
was just a it was gonna be just a four

106
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,110
hour like come and learn about mental

107
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:36,960
health issues at Derby con in 2018 right

108
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,310
and that was it turned into a full

109
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,430
two-day thing with like our own talks

110
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:49,770
and everything else right and so that's

111
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,870
that's the small picture of what we do

112
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,639
as a non-profit right we just kind of

113
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:57,719
have anywhere from little chill villages

114
00:05:57,719 --> 00:05:59,940
where you can kind of set up shop in and

115
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,250
be away from all the noise and the

116
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:06,060
people and just kind of chill out in and

117
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,419
know that you know you have people there

118
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:12,569
have your back up to the point where

119
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:15,029
there's like talks and massages and

120
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:17,460
workshops so all this kind of stuff well

121
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,319
we do have a whole lot of stuff planned

122
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:21,389
for the future as well depending on

123
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:23,400
we're really really trying for some

124
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,279
corporate sponsors to get some recurring

125
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:28,589
income in because right now a lot of our

126
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:30,500
stuff comes from like that stuff right

127
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,930
you know awesome people you know from

128
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:36,029
the community giving to a cause that

129
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:36,810
they

130
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:40,530
right and we know there are some big

131
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,540
companies out there with a lot of money

132
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,950
that would take some of that off of our

133
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:49,470
the people in the industry but we want

134
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:52,470
to do things like help others in the

135
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,030
industry like if they can't afford

136
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:58,410
therapy or either you know whether it's

137
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:02,430
in person or online something like that

138
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,900
right because that that's what can be

139
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,250
really expensive anywhere from like 40

140
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:10,620
bucks a month yeah yeah at least at

141
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,940
least in the US because their health

142
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:20,490
care sucks but we just kind of want to

143
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,500
help her own so you know all money that

144
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,190
we get goes back into stuff like that

145
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:29,520
right either really oh yeah sending you

146
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,560
know we we can actually run four of

147
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,370
these villages now I have one my CFO

148
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:38,070
Megan Andrade has one and then we have

149
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:41,160
these two ambassador kits which we just

150
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,250
sent one to Canada somewhere they've

151
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:51,050
been in Idaho and st. Louis and you have

152
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:54,690
you have a rep out here in the UK do you

153
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:59,220
know we do yeah yeah yeah yeah that's

154
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,500
good that you're covering off the kind

155
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,600
of almost a global program now yeah

156
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,650
we're trying to because we just want to

157
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:11,340
get it out as many places as we can you

158
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,910
know and and make as well use of any

159
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:17,100
money that we're given as possible

160
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,320
my employer helps out a whole lot

161
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,979
because like they paid for my travel

162
00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:25,169
okay I'm really lucky I'm just gonna be

163
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:26,880
able to work with a company that does

164
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,900
that a lot of times they don't and they

165
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,630
are cool with me just like shipping off

166
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,370
to Germany for a week and working from

167
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:41,729
there and yeah I just that's that's what

168
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,559
we're trying to do is just kind of grow

169
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:47,760
and fill needs for there are some so do

170
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,329
you see the psychological

171
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,519
sort of associations with information

172
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:56,989
security is it more pronounced it'd be

173
00:08:56,989 --> 00:08:59,420
depending on the role or are you finding

174
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,910
that corporate culture plays a big part

175
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,610
of it or what are you sort of seeing is

176
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,980
the main sort of drivers that are that

177
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,470
are most unsettling um

178
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,600
corporate culture is definitely a big

179
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,119
one I recently did a talk at Gurgaon

180
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:16,999
that kind of focused on that because

181
00:09:16,999 --> 00:09:20,689
there are I mean I'm sure we've all been

182
00:09:20,689 --> 00:09:23,239
there right where it's the company that

183
00:09:23,239 --> 00:09:26,989
is driving you to you know be productive

184
00:09:26,989 --> 00:09:29,350
be productive be productive at any cost

185
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,579
you know I've had people that I've

186
00:09:31,579 --> 00:09:33,949
worked with that are working 60 70 80

187
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:37,189
hour weeks just to get stuff done and

188
00:09:37,189 --> 00:09:39,980
their health falters and their mental

189
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,889
health and their relationships finances

190
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:45,259
like everything takes a hit because

191
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:48,170
they're not that's not healthy right um

192
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,259
other things like our culture and I'm

193
00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:54,949
sure lots of people realize this draws a

194
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:59,899
certain type of person we have you know

195
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,850
just people that are willing to sit

196
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:07,279
behind a screen for eight 12 36 hours at

197
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:19,100
a time right review log files but we we

198
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:24,730
draw that kind of person to our industry

199
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:32,869
because they fit well right there's a

200
00:10:32,869 --> 00:10:35,809
lot of data and there's a lot of stuff

201
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:39,069
that computers just makes sense yeah

202
00:10:39,069 --> 00:10:42,319
yeah so so we draw definitely certain

203
00:10:42,319 --> 00:10:46,399
types of people that I think just kind

204
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,679
of is exacerbates it have their

205
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:51,410
predisposition go ahead yeah

206
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:54,110
so do you think like the bone I've got

207
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:58,730
is a factor perhaps so if you take a

208
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,410
look at the work that we're doing we sit

209
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,799
in front of a computer we our Mobile's

210
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:04,310
when we search

211
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,380
what do we do we sit in front of the TV

212
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,590
we were variables so there's never a

213
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:12,340
disconnect like I've talked about this a

214
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:15,260
few weeks ago like a doctor will be in

215
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,300
that their office and then come home and

216
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,360
that's it do you think that has a some

217
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,420
impact on but other mental health in the

218
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:28,100
industry definitely one of the more

219
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,290
common talks that we see in our villages

220
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:37,120
is our focused around how not to do that

221
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,480
because it does lead to burnout whether

222
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,220
we want to admit it or not you know we

223
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,650
have super high turnover rate you know

224
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:48,080
in within this industry you know we

225
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,520
don't think anything of it if you're at

226
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,500
a place for a year and then go and hop

227
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,950
back and forth right that's I mean to

228
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:57,410
each their own but you know if you're in

229
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:00,529
a very happy healthy work environment

230
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:01,880
you're gonna be there for longer than a

231
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,510
year yeah because you know a good

232
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:10,120
environment is going to promote growth

233
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:16,000
that's one of the things that I really

234
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,990
recommended people to is you know either

235
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,180
I've started taking weekends right I'll

236
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,339
take weekends and I've never ever

237
00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:27,410
thought I would do this but leaving my

238
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,800
phone at home when I go places Wow

239
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:35,060
release is yes and it is very difficult

240
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:39,310
I it's like with your mom you're like

241
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:44,510
shakes like it's it's a very mentally

242
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:47,690
taxing thing to now be withdrawn from

243
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:54,950
that technology yeah I definitely I

244
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:57,470
can't eat I can't imagine that kind of

245
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,040
world

246
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,700
ah but you know I I still want to try it

247
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:06,140
because clearly you know what we're

248
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:09,020
doing is it's almost like our job is

249
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,270
destructive and then our coping

250
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,400
strategies to cope with that destructive

251
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,430
jaw are even more destructive than the

252
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:17,520
job itself

253
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,970
and we get into this cycle do you find

254
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:23,279
that when you talk to people about this

255
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,600
that you urge them to try and find a

256
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,060
hobby that is outside of this industry

257
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:36,050
or redefine themselves as not the job

258
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:38,910
yes because I mean when you when you

259
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:41,070
talk to somebody and you ask them oh so

260
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,450
tell me a little bit about yourself

261
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:45,630
what's the first thing 90% of people say

262
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:58,529
like what they do for a job I am very

263
00:13:58,529 --> 00:14:02,220
very I can't say that I don't do any of

264
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,050
these terrible habits because it's very

265
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:09,029
hard to break yourself even though I but

266
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:19,670
you know weaning yourself non

267
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:22,380
technology-driven habits right because

268
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,240
you can say oh like what's your other

269
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:34,410
hobby well I game yeah can you please

270

275
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:10,170
everything like that you have children

276
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:13,260
