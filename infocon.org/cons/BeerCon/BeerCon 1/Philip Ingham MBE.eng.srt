1
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:03,639
uh you know what no I think we can

2
00:00:03,639 --> 00:00:05,319
transition straight to Philip if I it

3
00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:10,260
seems like if I'm pausing I coulda died

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,250
seven o'clock in the morning you're

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,460
allowed to die hey I've been going all

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,880
night we've got about an hour of sleep

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,890
it just kind of intermittent there and

8
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:24,309
who do we have to got Mike back no you

9
00:00:24,309 --> 00:00:28,149
go Philip good morning folks well good

10
00:00:28,149 --> 00:00:29,529
morning to you sir

11
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:32,970
and I think it's safe to say that you're

12
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,940
the only MBE that we have on the show so

13
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,850
I think for people to understand where

14
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,370
you're coming from which is not I would

15
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:46,450
say true info sack give us an

16
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:51,070
introduction okay yeah not to InfoSec is

17
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,230
a good one I'm sort of an interloper and

18
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:56,890
I think my background I'm ex-military I

19
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,820
was in the British Army for 26 years and

20
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,460
that's where I was very fortunate to

21
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,670
have collected enough cereal packet tops

22
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:10,960
to get them submitted and be given the

23
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,680
badge the awards I just very very

24
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,680
fortunate to be awarded the MBE which

25
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,310
for those who aren't from the UK it is a

26
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,960
member of the Order of the British

27
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,330
Empire that is an award that was

28
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:28,030
bestowed by Her Majesty the Queen for

29
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,720
having done something that makes you

30
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,700
stand out and heard the turn around and

31
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,830
decide that you get an award and for me

32
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:38,549
it was as part of NATO planning team

33
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:40,630
taking over from the United Nations

34
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,180
going into Bosnia and I was Minister

35
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,770
intelligence officer and here's where

36
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,840
the InfoSec link sort of comes in and

37
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,990
and part of my responsibility in that

38
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:53,650
was providing overall security and

39
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,180
security policy for different places

40
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,369
that I was in and part of that security

41
00:01:57,369 --> 00:01:59,229
policy was the wire in through sex and

42
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:02,140
cyber security policy and policing that

43
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,810
as part of a wider threat piece and that

44
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,299
was out there so I do have a little bit

45
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:10,060
of intersect credibility from a

46
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,590
practitioners perspective but I wasn't

47
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,050
it was really just a policy Center and

48
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,400
had lots of people to do all that it

49
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,569
still works for me

50
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:22,930
we've understood great but I mean having

51
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,099
said that you are a favorite of Kate and

52
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:29,950
Davie winter for commentary and I think

53
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,549
you know you've really shown that you're

54
00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:38,170
taking a view of the nation-state

55
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:41,049
activity out there and terrorism and

56
00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:44,200
counterterrorism and commenting publicly

57
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,239
about it you know with with great

58
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,519
comments comes great responsibility are

59
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:53,260
you sort of seeing an evolution of the

60
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:57,610
threat actor I've got into that so it's

61
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,140
leaving the military of sort of fall

62
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,239
into journalism so I write and report

63
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:03,700
about it and yeah you're the intersect

64
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,370
threat I look at all threats equally and

65
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,030
the wider cyber threat and InfoSec

66
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,000
threat is out there and it's something I

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,349
monitor very very closely so if I can

68
00:03:14,349 --> 00:03:18,670
comment on it is more thing it is

69
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:22,720
changing and they and I think we're

70
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,880
actually missing a lot of it the

71
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,739
lower-level threats are the same the

72
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:33,880
activists the script kids the criminals

73
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,859
that are out there there's this new ways

74
00:03:35,859 --> 00:03:37,239
developing all the time of the time to

75
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:37,840
steal your money

76
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,579
the thing that concerns me and you've

77
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:41,739
mentioned it there most is the

78
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:46,569
development of the nation-state and the

79
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:47,799
levels that the nation-state

80
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:51,069
will go down to is something that I

81
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:52,959
don't think many people realize everyone

82
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,310
thinks that a nation-state is going to

83
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,989
focus on another nation state it's big

84
00:03:55,989 --> 00:03:58,090
target see and it's for espionage it's

85
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,700
four spines for everything else a lot of

86
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,709
people don't realize that nation-states

87
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:05,769
will actually target individuals nation

88
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:09,130
states are developing capabilities that

89
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,530
are out there that they're getting kids

90
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,190
to use to spy on their behalf and nation

91
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:19,149
states are using proxies to use you to

92
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:21,070
carry out a lot of their activities so

93
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,419
that they've got an element of plausible

94
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:25,000
deniability and with the nation-state

95
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,450
factor

96
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,580
one of the big issues is in in warfare

97
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,430
terms there are sort of four

98
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:35,600
environments there's land air maritime

99
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,730
and space right

100
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,350
each of those four environments are

101
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,900
controlled by either the Geneva

102
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,670
protocols or the other Space Treaty of

103
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:48,800
1969 v environment is cyberspace right

104
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,660
there's no international regulation

105
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:54,020
whatsoever yeah and I mean it's been

106
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,630
controversial because the Tallinn manual

107
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,700
is in its second printing the

108
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,740
International Committee of the Red Cross

109
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,160
issued a paper on the use of cyber

110
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,430
weapons but you're absolutely correct in

111
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:10,130
that there is I think a lot of

112
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:14,390
governance and rhetoric I was really

113
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:19,220
concerned when you know a member of

114
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,680
parliament in the UK suggested that a

115
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,560
cyber attack could result in a kinetic

116
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,290
response but then I thought about that

117
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:34,190
and I went wait a second if cyber could

118
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:37,820
actually cause a mass casualty incident

119
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,820
then a kinetic response might be an

120
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,500
appropriate response what are your

121
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,450
thoughts on that

122
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:46,730
well we talked about cyber and we talked

123
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:48,080
about it as if it's something could be

124
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,620
different I'm holding up my index finger

125
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,450
on my right hand at the minute like

126
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,790
that's that's a digit that was the

127
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,220
biggest digital problem that the reason

128
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,770
that's right there because it has to

129
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,590
click something has to push a button and

130
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:06,560
you something that we talk about inside

131
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,820
where it starts in the physical world

132
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,400
and ends up with a reaction in the

133
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,630
physical world and that we actually

134
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,180
could be a kinetic effect coming back

135
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,450
against someone or it could be a kinetic

136
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,930
effect through

137
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,760
a control system and the dam being

138
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,140
interrupted and the floodgates being

139
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,420
opened and that's that that causes a bit

140
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,420
of a physical effect and therefore you

141
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,180
know it in cases it would be very

142
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,010
appropriate that there is a physical

143
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,080
response and I think it's only a matter

144
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,199
of time I'm rocking the

145
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,979
because i thinkand read an incident were

146
00:06:42,979 --> 00:06:46,039
there was a physical response in syria

147
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:49,159
to a cyber cyber incident

148
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:52,099
well there was Hamas Hamas operatives

149
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:54,979
that were allegedly preparing a cyber

150
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:55,999
attack yep

151
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,310
I've got killed by the Israelis that's

152
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,900
right I love the building right that's

153
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,219
that's that's that's the one I was

154
00:07:01,219 --> 00:07:07,310
thinking of it but also the so called

155
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,900
Isis had an organization called the

156
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,949
United cyber caliphate

157
00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:13,310
yes Caliphate was out there cyberattacks

158
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,199
and other bits and pieces the head of

159
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,879
the United cyber Caliphate just after it

160
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:20,930
he was asking an individual who I

161
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:24,949
happened to know to try and help develop

162
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:26,659
some training material for what they

163
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:29,569
were doing and a couple of days after he

164
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:32,439
had put that request in and his

165
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:34,849
cybersecurity wasn't good enough and a

166
00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:36,919
500-pound bomb ended up in this cyber

167
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:39,229
cafe that he was sitting in at that time

168
00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:42,169
you know did you know if it disappeared

169
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:45,310
so at the moment we're seeing physical

170
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:48,560
effects on activity that's going on in

171
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,960
cyberspace and from an espionage

172
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,419
perspective you've always said that from

173
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:55,099
a policing perspective we've always had

174
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,689
that you know the script kiddie sitting

175
00:07:56,689 --> 00:07:59,180
in his room hacking into the bank will

176
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,740
tend to result in a physical effect of

177
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,849
the police kicking his door down and

178
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:03,949
coming in way for a little bit of

179
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:08,749
questioning yeah oh yeah two worlds are

180
00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:11,360
completely linked and it's wrong with

181
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,039
people to try and I think from a wider

182
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,680
security perspective to try and separate

183
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,439
cyberspace out as something completely

184
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:20,649
different we have to think of everything

185
00:08:20,649 --> 00:08:23,930
holistically and the more the more times

186
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,089
we think of it holistically then you can

187
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:28,520
you can look at dealing with the

188
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,539
potential threats that are out there

189
00:08:29,539 --> 00:08:31,219
against or threat actors and

190
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,899
understanding how it's going to impact

191
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:36,260
on you and your organization that those

192
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,269
are all really great points and I think

193
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:40,159
you're absolutely right that it that

194
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,279
it's interlinked and it is something

195
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,269
that is not easily deconstructed I want

196
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:49,699
to talk a little bit though about your

197
00:08:49,699 --> 00:08:51,050
transition from

198
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:56,300
military service to civilian and and so

199
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,959
there are a lot of folks contemplating

200
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:01,459
making the move coming out of the

201
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:04,730
military and moving into civilian

202
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:07,760
practice what advice would you give them

203
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,000
what what did you discover on that

204
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,850
journey that they might benefit from

205
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,410
well I went through the journey in a

206
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,360
slightly painful way because I came out

207
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,740
of the military not realizing that I was

208
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,290
suffering quite badly from PTSD and it

209
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:23,120
took me a number of years before I got

210
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,540
to position and properly diagnose and

211
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:31,100
treated the transition it's not as

212
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:35,930
difficult people think it's it's trying

213
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,640
to understand that and all you're doing

214
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,220
is going into an environment were

215
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,390
there's two things people are talking a

216
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:44,959
different language generally in civilian

217
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,970
life

218
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:50,390
people don't care that sounds a little

219
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,700
cruel people are the military's a little

220
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,579
bit teamwork you don't work as a team

221
00:09:55,579 --> 00:09:57,230
and you don't work as a team all

222
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:00,020
overtime and all of the training all of

223
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,670
the environment everything else is built

224
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:05,930
around you met looking after you people

225
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:08,300
doing things automatically to help you

226
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,950
because your that should be what's going

227
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,600
on that's that's the environment it

228
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,290
doesn't always happen but when what I

229
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:17,300
find I'm going into civilian business

230
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,700
and all the rest of it is that certainly

231
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,760
in business terms most people right for

232
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,370
number one and that's quite hard to get

233
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:29,000
used to and the motivation is not there

234
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,250
from a team perspective you get some

235
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,630
exceptional companies you get some

236
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:35,360
exceptional groups of people who buck

237
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,779
the trend and but you know I I got out

238
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:40,790
and went into the steel industry as a

239
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:44,089
sales marketing director and to learn

240
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:45,470
about business that nothing to do with

241
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:49,390
the military and certainly find that

242
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:52,160
that you know at every turn I was having

243
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,899
to watch my back you know I I almost had

244
00:10:53,899 --> 00:10:56,650
the more body armor on

245
00:10:56,650 --> 00:11:00,610
in business and in war zones and that

246
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:04,270
shop recycling however what I've also

247
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,340
found is that there are some exceptional

248
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,710
people out there and when I left the

249
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,220
steel industry and set up my own

250
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,230
security consulting and marketing

251
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:16,060
business before I fell into journalism

252
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,660
you know I came across some absolutely

253
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:22,690
except dedicated individuals who helped

254
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:26,140
me learn my new trade who helped me

255
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:29,020
develop who your help helped push me

256
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:33,580
forward so it's it's the biggest bit of

257
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,050
advices of that and just contradicted

258
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,340
myself and everything I've said in the

259
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,840
last couple of minutes is it's a

260
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,060
different environment go in your eyes

261
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,430
open it's exciting there's lots of

262
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,800
opportunities it's not the same as the

263
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,350
military and you have to realize that

264
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,930
within it you have to look after

265
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,700
yourself there's no one else looking out

266
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,460
for you as you go through things and

267
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,920
just just be who you are don't try and

268
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,230
pretend to be something and that you're

269
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,800
not I see a lot of military people that

270
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,110
come out and they tried to be something

271
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,550
different because they've done lots of

272
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,990
courses they've done lots of

273
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,600
qualifications they put a sailor etc

274
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,860
this next section of that and they've

275
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,350
got hundreds of certificates and letters

276
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,090
after the names and everything else but

277
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,890
the bit of practical experience so yeah

278
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,620
we don't know what they're doing and

279
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:24,760
that stands I very quickly indeed so the

280
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,180
other biggest tip is be humble and learn

281
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:32,170
from people and don't be afraid to to

282
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:33,880
learn from those that in the military

283
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,030
you would say are at a lower level than

284
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,820
you I've learned more from a large

285
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,900
number of my junior noncommissioned

286
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,830
officers and my my senior

287
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,810
non-commissioned officers than I have

288
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:49,990
done from anyone that was more at my

289
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,490
level or more senior than me when I was

290
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:54,880
in the military so I I didn't find it a

291
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,440
difficult transition but that's because

292
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,640
I was having other difficulties okay so

293
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,490
let's let's turn our intelligence lens

294
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:07,029
to the tragedy that just occurred on

295
00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:09,639
yeah and what I found interesting is

296
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:11,620
this was the first time that the tragedy

297
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,529
had occurred that the rhetoric of we

298
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:18,459
need encryption backdoors wasn't rolled

299
00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:21,519
out as you'll recall after Manchester

300
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,470
and after the previous London Bridge

301
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:27,149
there was some Member of Parliament that

302
00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:29,800
continued to press for Christian

303
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,870
backdoors do you think the encryption

304
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:35,529
backdoor in the UK issue is is a dead

305
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:37,750
issue now or do you feel it's just a

306
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,959
quiet issue because of the current

307
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,750
election climate I don't think is quiet

308
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,100
because the current is actually climate

309
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,629
but I don't think it's a dead issue at

310
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:49,389
all I think it is something that was

311
00:13:49,389 --> 00:13:51,399
good to come up more and more and more

312
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:55,389
and more because the government agencies

313
00:13:55,389 --> 00:13:58,000
are having real difficulties and they

314
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,269
see this naively as a solution and for

315
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:02,829
some reason or other think that just cuz

316
00:14:02,829 --> 00:14:05,860
they govern the agencies that get away

317
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:06,279
with it

318
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:07,990
of course you crypto backdoors exist in

319
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:12,040
Russia exist they exist in or you're all

320
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,420
of the oppressed it's that are out there

321
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,430
so got some governments come can't sit

322
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,649
and look at things but that doesn't make

323
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:20,290
it appropriate for us to do that

324
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:24,040
the the London Bridge attack you the

325
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,500
individual and it's early days and

326
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,790
subject still subject to police

327
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:30,399
investigation it looks as if the

328
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,990
individual was a lone wolf or

329
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:34,930
self-motivated and interestingly at the

330
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,790
time there's a couple of weeks

331
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:40,870
beforehand we had the so called Isis and

332
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:45,639
al Qaeda encrypted communications on

333
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:49,569
telegram taken down by July Europol yeah

334
00:14:49,569 --> 00:14:52,059
I watched that with great interest well

335
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:55,389
the thing about that is that some Isis

336
00:14:55,389 --> 00:14:59,470
and al Qaeda executed a perfect business

337
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:02,559
continuity plan and they and they have

338
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:05,439
reopened the communication sites on a

339
00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:08,199
number of other different internal

340
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:11,050
encrypted platforms which are even

341
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,720
harder for the intelligence services to

342
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,480
penetrate so I think as that comes more

343
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,900
and more and if more attacks happen

344
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,220
an unfortunate thing that's an

345
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:25,750
inevitability not something that isn't

346
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,970
going to happen it as more attacks

347
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,880
happen then I think the cry to try and

348
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,730
force some form of backdoor is going to

349
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,980
grow more and more but I don't think any

350
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,630
Western governments gonna be powerful

351
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:41,170
enough to achieve that right but the

352
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:43,600
tournaments of thought in there you know

353
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,400
are they putting it out as a cried to

354
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,590
try and keep it in and the public domain

355
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,780
to cover the fact because they actually

356
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,850
have a genuine need to get in or are

357
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,140
they doing it to try and cover the fact

358
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,430
that the really got backdoors into

359
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:58,180
lovely system yes exactly are listening

360
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,250
away as it is we're going to ask for

361
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,990
something that we already have so that

362
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:06,250
people think we don't have it correct or

363
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,880
never everyone says you're accessing the

364
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,860
the dark web and all the rest of tours

365
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,870
the only way to get in those tor was

366
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,310
invented by u.s. naval intelligence

367
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:17,620
that's right you know you know you

368
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:21,640
nobody could convince me that an

369
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,080
organization that has developed

370
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,470
something has not got a method of having

371
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:29,250
a look at what goes on in the background

372
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:33,120
well when you do have the resources of

373
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,460
the United States certainly and you

374
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,680
understand a little bit about the the

375
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,580
architecture of tor the vulnerability

376
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:46,180
being in control of the end the exit

377
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:49,270
relays it's conceivable that a nation

378
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:51,940
may be able to establish enough exit

379
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:55,770
relays under their control to

380
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:58,660
essentially try and reassemble a session

381
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:01,630
so it needs theoretical I don't think

382
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,370
the attacks have actually taken place

383
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:07,450
but again if such capability existed why

384
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:09,849
would you want to reveal it to to the

385
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:12,970
bad actors correct and there's

386
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,349
capability being developed all the time

387
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:16,390
it was controversy at the moment in the

388
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,680
run-up to the UK general election

389
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,970
because they're saying that the

390
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,900
documents that were released by the

391
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,690
leader of the Opposition talking about

392
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:27,839
trade talks between the UK and the US

393
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,040
over the National Health Service right

394
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,270
those those been released for the

395
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,670
roofies and to the to the Labour Party

396
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,350
or Russian connectors to get to get them

397
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,480
out in the first place

398
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,740
Tizen real Russian hacking Russian

399
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:43,790
influence and all the electrics but it's

400
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:48,230
wider than that it's it's it's Russian

401
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,450
Chinese and other influence of those

402
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:51,460
around the world

403
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,530
a few years ago with a big Asami attack

404
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:58,700
yeah and Americans were very quick to

405
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,680
turn around and blame the North Koreans

406
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,190
their terrain I find it fascinating

407
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,690
North Korea when you look at it we've

408
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:09,440
got a country where they can't send they

409
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,720
don't send anyone overseas to study at

410
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,000
any of our universities about modern

411
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,440
technology and about how everything

412
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,450
works Internet doesn't exist could you

413
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:19,730
just don't exist routinely within the

414
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,710
society where are they getting people

415
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,240
with all of us technical knowledge to be

416
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,330
able to understand how modern scripts

417
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:27,710
are working from modern communications

418
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:30,710
networks are working and to provide you

419
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,230
to develop these hacking teams that can

420
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,900
get past anything that's our big

421
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,430
companies have got with very

422
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,140
sophisticated

423
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:43,040
protection mechanisms in place there's

424
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,210
one question you throw out there

425
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,580
the second question is how is North

426
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,410
Korea connected to the Internet and the

427
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:49,070
wider world

428
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,050
yeah I'm not most likely easy to answer

429
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:53,900
there are two internet pipes that go

430
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,880
into North Korea there's a relatively

431
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,130
small one that's been there for a number

432
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:00,460
of years that's provided by China

433
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:05,620
there's a second one three years ago the

434
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:08,840
second pipe was put into North Korea by

435
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,920
a company called trans telecom okay

436
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,740
trans telecom is a Russian

437
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:18,020
telecommunications company that is part

438
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:22,910
of the russian national railway

439
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:26,720
organization and and it's wholly owned

440
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,800
by the kremlin and you know they it's

441
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,740
quite normal that telecoms companies are

442
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,960
a part of railway companies because the

443
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,280
old traditional phone lines used to

444
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,120
break but you have to ask why the

445
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,180
Russians put such a big pipeline in and

446
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:44,930
if you look at the tie

447
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,940
it was also very interesting whenever

448
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:51,950
Kim jong-un's missile tests were failing

449
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,690
nine times out of ten in very

450
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,220
short-range missiles as they as they

451
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:58,430
blew up on the pad or yeah by very far

452
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:01,340
to within several months after that and

453
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:04,850
he had very long range missiles that

454
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:07,040
were being successful nine times out of

455
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,010
ten right and you didn't have to look at

456
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:12,380
what was a wider geopolitics that's

457
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,260
going on here you fought for so both

458
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,270
Russia and China controls the internet

459
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,950
pipe and control all the internet

460
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,890
traffic going in and out of North Korea

461
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:24,980
mmm okay and North Korea get blamed for

462
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,150
lots of these attacks that are out there

463
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:30,170
yeah we've got this naughty schoolboy

464
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:31,850
unfortunate nuclear weapons and Kim

465
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:35,900
jong-un but he's a very good possibly

466
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:39,050
deniable outlet for other nation-state

467
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,760
activity so if the Russians the Chinese

468
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,160
wanted to do something but blame blame

469
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,620
the boy in the naughty step they can

470
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:48,430
only get the blame North Korea easily

471
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:54,590
absolutely we have to recognize that and

472
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,660
it's a very strong possibility I mean

473
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:01,580
recently we saw a PT 28 Turla a subject

474
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:05,600
or hijack infrastructure attributed to

475
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,990
Iranian cyber algorithms so you know not

476
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:12,020
with our president of Philip I just want

477
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,480
to say it was my pleasure having you on

478
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,260
beer com1 any sort of last thoughts that

479
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,200
you want to leave our audience with I

480
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,790
think this is absolutely fantastic and

481
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:25,190
hats off to you guys that tinfoil hats

482
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,780
off to you guys for a put this together

483
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,330
and the charities that you are

484
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,940
supporting are phenomenal you know I

485
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,670
just actively encourage everyone to get

486
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,220
on urn and started contribute as much as

487
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,350
they possibly can I'm good thank you

488
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:41,840
thank you so much for that and yes we're

489
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,970
doing quite well we just had a donation

490
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,919
from Wendy Edwards a little while ago

491
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:48,750
and we're at four thousand two hundred

492
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:52,049
and eighty quid raised so we are quickly

493
00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:54,900
approaching our five thousand quid goal

494
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,570
or five thousand would be the halfway

495
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:00,450
point we have a goal of ten thousand so
