1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,689
yeah all right so meadow are you there I

2
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:06,990
am I am there no I you are there and you

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,170
are here right okay

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:13,139
listeners welcome back we had a brief

5
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:15,570
outage but as you can tell the

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,119
engineering team were on it and we got

7
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:22,230
it sorted really quickly so all that's

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,000
left now really is to welcome meadow

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,740
Ellis to become one so hi better I mean

10
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:36,059
I'm very happy to have been invited by

11
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:38,280
you this conference it's our pleasure

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,520
that you've joined us so for a couple of

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,200
minutes would you mind introducing

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,570
yourself telling us who you are and what

15
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,520
you do absolutely

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,390
well first of all I'm not a meadow so

17
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,449
how you probably know me on Twitter

18
00:00:53,449 --> 00:00:56,100
someone asked me recently a my Twitter

19
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,910
famous because they follow me on Twitter

20
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,949
I'm like I think I didn't put the famous

21
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:04,290
so yes mostly I'm mostly known from

22
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,540
Twitter and runs on Twitter but what I

23
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,380
do for nobody for security is hardware

24
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,350
security and engineering so I deal with

25
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,860
the all sorts of problems from ranging

26
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:22,560
from and supply chain security so making

27
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,890
sure that the devices you you you

28
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,840
receive are still in the same state that

29
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,259
the manufacturer or vendor wanted them

30
00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:34,320
to getting and opening black boxes and

31
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,270
understanding how they work and how they

32
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,670
are being used for for criminal purposes

33
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,140
for my purposes and yeah I'm trying to

34
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,920
teach people stuff about engineering

35
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,310
about theater design I'm trying to

36
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,439
spread the knowledge about how you

37
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:55,860
design stuff like this how you can can

38
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,680
can get yourself into hardware security

39
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,509
and hardware hardware hacking sort of

40
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:03,840
thing awesome so why you back a few

41
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,799
years tell us how you got into secured

42
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,449
it in the first place where do we come

43
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:09,780
from

44
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,250
I did

45
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:18,070
I okay I I would say my my journey into

46
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:22,500
security wasn't standard one as probably

47
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,360
many of us have had different

48
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,160
backgrounds before my background is

49
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:33,900
engineering as such so I I it wasn't

50
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,120
about clean cars for me starting going

51
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,370
from engineering security it was just

52
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:42,960
slowly moving into this area of security

53
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,480
because my job was always most of the

54
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,490
time was about reverse engineering stuff

55
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:53,680
just for different purposes so for

56
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,000
example if you have if you need

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,700
something to if you need to make

58
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,290
something work you have to find out how

59
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,910
it works all right so this is your basic

60
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:05,320
hacking yeah then you have this this

61
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,700
thing that maybe the way it works is not

62
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,340
secure so you slowly sliding into the

63
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,989
security of how things work by trying to

64
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:21,370
find out how they work so as I said

65
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,519
there wasn't a clean cut for me going

66
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:26,110
from engineering to security is just

67
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:29,350
sort of merge together and I don't think

68
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,720
those words I talked to totally separate

69
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,410
I think I think especially even hard

70
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,750
with security those two things are

71
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:43,360
pretty pretty much go side by side it's

72
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,299
just that in the past few years security

73
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:51,280
stopped being something very hermetic

74
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,480
very closed it encompassing more and

75
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,239
more fields around us and we were more

76
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,670
and more aware of this problem called

77
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,980
security so I think that's what happened

78
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:06,700
with me so I didn't jump into security

79
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,519
our security sort of swallowed me and

80
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,440
many other engineers because suddenly

81
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,160
we've come someone who start on working

82
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,839
on designing stuff it's not a working on

83
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,899
that's not only working on making stuff

84
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:24,650
work but also making stuff secure cool

85
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,750
how long we been doing this job how do

86
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,770
you actually been in security matter

87
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,740
about seven years that I mean seven

88
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,050
years is when I can say that was

89
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,840
strictly security before that I don't

90
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,340
want to say how much I was working

91
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:53,180
because it's it's been the world it's

92
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,669
been a while so I would say that seven

93
00:04:55,669 --> 00:04:59,419
years seven years is the the amount of

94
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:00,979
time I was doing something that was

95
00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:03,320
fifty related to security and before

96
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,990
that was just security like for example

97
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,789
you're working in a company that's doing

98
00:05:07,789 --> 00:05:10,580
a student that's working for

99
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:14,600
manufacturing and you have to you have

100
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,300
to get responsible for the manufacturing

101
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,250
flow you doing automation for

102
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,889
manufacturing flow and you think

103
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:23,630
software that's running manufacturing

104
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:26,930
flow and if you're doing that you can

105
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:30,199
either just make it work or make it work

106
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:33,229
so that it's also secure all right so

107
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:35,270
before those accept more than seven

108
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,070
years ago that was this kind of thing

109
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,320
that I was doing even though not being

110
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,570
employed as someone working for security

111
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:45,050
strictly security and to be honest no

112
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:48,250
one really gave a flying crap about

113
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,550
security a fly fine yes thank you

114
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,159
there was always the back in in the back

115
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:58,820
of my mind I have to do it in a good way

116
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,490
proper way so yeah I would say seven

117
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:03,409
years and before that it was just like

118
00:06:03,409 --> 00:06:05,539
mixing mango off of security in

119
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:08,659
engineering so describe your average day

120
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:11,090
at work so is it cannon meadows got a

121
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:13,430
soldering iron or is messing with je

122
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,020
t'adore all that kind of stuff is that

123
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,310
is that kind of thing that you do

124
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,830
regularly or ei you can work a bit above

125
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,380
all that stuff I this is this is

126
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,090
precisely what I what I'm doing day

127
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:27,050
today so yes so my my my my day job I'm

128
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,409
blessed by not having to participate in

129
00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:35,190
many meetings many calls

130
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:38,880
I can basically focuses on D on the

131
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,410
engineering part of the of my of my

132
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:44,100
employment

133
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,400
so yes you described quite well that I

134
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,860
have Solyndra and I have other lab staff

135
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,000
and JTACs and all these fancy buzzwords

136
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,880
and this is what I'm doing day to day so

137
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,080
I I would say that that the job like

138
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,950
this is sort of maybe a bit creative in

139
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:09,690
the sense that you have to it's not 9:00

140
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,120
to 5:00 it's not a nine-to-five job try

141
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,460
to find if 9 to 5 jobs sorry sure

142
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,910
because it's something you are be being

143
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,500
given a problem and you have to think

144
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,420
about it for a while but you have our

145
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,890
black box you don't know what it's doing

146
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:26,250
you don't know what the purpose of this

147
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:30,270
black pot is black box is how to how it

148
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:35,100
works what who made it and you have to

149
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,080
think about this for a while so it's not

150
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,820
something that you can start at 9:00

151
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:42,690
a.m. and finish at 5:30 p.m. we go home

152
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,130
and then just you know think about

153
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,840
something else your mind always works

154
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,960
about this around those topics so in

155
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,400
that respect it's it's sort of a

156
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,210
creative job because you're always

157
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,550
thinking about this you always think in

158
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:59,669
and as I say it's not something you can

159
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:02,370
just sit on your desk and decide that I

160
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:05,490
would have it done in two hours no maybe

161
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,440
I will have it done in two weeks because

162
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,410
I simply don't know I mean part of part

163
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:14,010
of my job I do my job is also they what

164
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:19,230
I would say static pen testing so it's

165
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:21,300
also evaluating security of hardware

166
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:26,520
that is coming from vendors so it's sort

167
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:31,919
of similar to - to the mainstream pen

168
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,130
testing - I would say so you have to you

169
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,679
are being given a box advice from a

170
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,539
vendor and the vendor side is perfect

171
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:43,219
it's fantastic like you know we take

172
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:47,380
your security seriously

173
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:54,800
yes and you find out that they because

174
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,960
they they just suck at what they're

175
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,230
doing and this is also this is also what

176
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,960
what I and my team are doing to be know

177
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:07,700
about them because it's very important

178
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,940
to verify always verify to what vendors

179
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,670
are telling you because they lie because

180
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,620
they simply like that's that's all there

181
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,680
is to it then just like vendors lie I

182
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:26,300
know right yeah but this is that's so

183
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:30,290
matter granted you've been in this field

184
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:33,980
for seven years now that's a fair chunk

185
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:37,220
of time to kind of answer this question

186
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,590
do you think vendors are getting better

187
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:43,730
or are things stagnating or what do you

188
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,860
what are your opinions in them they're

189
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,050
not getting better they're getting

190
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:51,110
better at selling stuff I mean I think

191
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,790
this is that the problem that we have

192
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:55,370
with security provided by vendors is

193
00:09:55,370 --> 00:10:01,250
that the day they vary as the the group

194
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:05,450
of vendors the industry of setting

195
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,040
security so they have learned how to

196
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,850
talk to c-level people or what I like to

197
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:15,920
call and it's not but Excel people so

198
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,740
they have a way of selling their

199
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:22,040
products to people who will be sign the

200
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,980
contracts and who will be negotiating in

201
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,930
sign the contracts and then sign the

202
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:31,190
employee invoices without skipping the

203
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:34,310
engineering product and that's that's

204
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,810
the problem that we have at the moment

205
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:39,200
because the it's sort of like a housing

206
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,790
bubble but it's not housing bubble is

207
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:44,450
it's its vendor bubble so we have many

208
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,760
products were extremely expensive like

209
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,210
they the price tags I am seeing on some

210
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:53,840
products is like is it critical how can

211
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,000
you charge this amount of money for the

212
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,780
thing that you said but it works

213
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,480
so it is it is generating revenue for

214
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,230
them and the problem with this is that

215
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,090
those products are not necessarily

216
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:11,420
exactly bad but they are not worth the

217
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,550
money but sometimes there are some times

218
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,950
they are just plain bad and the problem

219
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:19,430
with this is that because the engineer

220
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,710
isn't being skipped not being asked

221
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,660
about or you know maybe a being asked

222
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,280
about but no one listens to them anyway

223
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:29,930
so even the point of concerns and then

224
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,820
but they are being given this correct to

225
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:35,720
work all right and they have to because

226
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,940
the the company has spent five hundred

227
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,460
million of whatever kinds you want on

228
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,230
this and there's no way out

229
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:45,560
now you have to work with this so this

230
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,680
is what I'm observing D obviously the

231
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,890
technology is moving forward so vendors

232
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:55,370
we are all improving right so the people

233
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,020
or the companies who are making these

234
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,820
solutions they're obviously getting

235
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,760
better because this is natural right we

236
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,170
are moving forward we're just improving

237
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:05,240
when I deposit quality of software

238
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:10,550
hardware but at the same time they are

239
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:13,240
not focusing on the start that step

240
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,800
that's important because it doesn't

241
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,460
bring you money

242
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,440
what brings you money is setting

243
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,400
buzzwords like you know blockchain and

244
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,690
what have you concentrate on some proof

245
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:34,600
that's my question

246
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,930
defenders getting better not in the way

247
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:41,630
that I would like to they are getting

248
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,670
better at selling stuff but not

249
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,920
necessarily at delivering what they say

250
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,720
so I've got a question for you the

251
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,500
minute but when I was a younger guy I

252
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,230
used to do industrial control solutions

253
00:12:54,230 --> 00:13:01,580
and plc scada back in those days a I

254
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:05,480
could feel it was suits and B nobody

255
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,400
cared about security it just didn't it

256
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,130
wasn't a thing nobody cared about it did

257
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:12,620
it did the PLC operate the machine

258
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,440
that it do the process automation that

259
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,490
was expected yes good all good

260
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:23,780
so going on you know thirty years you

261
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,110
see technology coming on your desk and

262
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:29,600
vendors supplying you with things the

263
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,240
question is what without mentioning the

264
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,670
vendor or naming the vendor what's the

265
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:37,820
most criminal thing you see in terms of

266
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,280
a vulnerability in a device or a piece

267
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:47,170
of technology that you assess I dumped

268
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:50,210
okay so let me put it this way I worked

269
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:53,450
in a lab environments for a very long

270
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:56,210
time so manufacturing lab environments

271
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,870
testing those are sort of similar stuff

272
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:04,610
similar places it's I wouldn't say this

273
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:08,150
is something that has gone away because

274
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:12,680
it's still there so every piece of lab

275
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:16,070
equipment and lab or engineering

276
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,260
equipment is not designed to be operated

277
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,540
in a secure manner so let me tell you

278
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:26,330
for example that I have I have been

279
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:31,580
lucky to to operate a very expensive

280
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:35,810
equipment for the past few weeks for a

281
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:38,830
very known engineering company and this

282
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:43,070
equipment when connected to the network

283
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:46,460
it has RDP on it with no username and

284
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:51,110
password and it's it's it's not

285
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:54,380
something uncommon it's normal it's

286
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,460
absolutely normal

287
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,340
that's why when you ask me like what

288
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,740
would be the most critical one I believe

289
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,270
very hard that I I've seen that I

290
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,790
thought that this is not you know this

291
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:07,370
is not vulnerability right this is just

292
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,560
the problem that we have in this

293
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,670
industry because we we as security

294
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,860
information security tend to forget that

295
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,570
there's the world outside our bubble

296
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:20,720
right and yet the world right very back

297
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,420
next to us because they are using this

298
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,250
equipment as running on Windows

299
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,290
even in Windows 10 it doesn't matter

300
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,500
that this is recently updated Windows 10

301
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,690
if we have RDP with no user name and

302
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:35,900
password all right yeah and this is the

303
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,790
device this is the state of device that

304
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:40,000
you're getting from the manufacturer and

305
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,590
nowhere in the manual nowhere in in any

306
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:47,240
QuickStart instructions does it say

307
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,600
first of all change the password or do

308
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,050
something like no this is not something

309
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,610
that people who are using those devices

310
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:57,470
take today are interested in they want

311
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,330
them to work and I have to tell you

312
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:02,410
those are extremely expensive devices

313
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:06,230
but by default everything is open right

314
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:09,290
and we still have protocols that are

315
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:12,500
being used one the most the most common

316
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,000
one I mean from at least from my

317
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,890
perspective this keeps skipping protocol

318
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:18,500
scpi that's pronounced Skippy protocol

319
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:23,570
which is just basically a socket

320
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,960
alternate based protocol that industrial

321
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,910
or lab equipment uses to communicate

322
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:31,460
with each other it doesn't have any

323
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:35,140
security on it and still being used very

324
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:38,810
widely used in most of the lab devices

325
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:42,410
because it just works all right so all

326
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,890
the security of laps of engineering are

327
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,900
just depending on perimeter security if

328
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,710
you break the perimeter everything is

329
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,800
yours game over yeah it's that idea

330
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,560
around him it's not my phrase this but

331
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,970
I'm just gonna say it anyway it's like

332
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:01,250
plug and play mm-hm

333
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,710
so you have the the idea of you know

334
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:06,050
whether it's IOT devices in the home or

335
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:10,010
whether it's IP cameras DVRs all the

336
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:12,680
stuff that we hear about that engineers

337
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,130
install and they're getting a meal and

338
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:18,530
but nobody talks about the VLAN in terms

339
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,689
of segregation or any that kind of stuff

340
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:23,000
but the camera system works and you can

341
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,859
see your employees walking around the

342
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:26,750
car park and all that kind of thing and

343
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,480
that's it job done yeah because we talk

344
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,630
about functionality and feature features

345
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:35,570
and does it work yes it works fantastic

346
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:37,380
let's all go home

347
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,740
weekend wonderful but nobody considers

348
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,900
security the vendor doesn't even

349
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,000
consider security so when the ship their

350
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,710
canvas to you I'm thinking a hit vision

351
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,510
and other manufacturers are available

352
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:51,900
originally but they have hard-coded

353
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:56,010
creds or they have weapon though white

354
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:58,500
wireless detection so you can create

355
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,390
your own hotspot and then the camera

356
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:03,210
imaging is also a new mobile device and

357
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,830
they're not thinking about this kind of

358
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,180
stuff they're thinking about filling a

359
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:10,050
van full attack go outside plug it all

360
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:12,270
in off you go finish and I think that's

361
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,390
one of the big problems that we've got I

362
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:17,850
mean in terms of those devices that I

363
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:21,120
was I was talking about so when I say

364
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,130
the next phrase some people will know

365
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,780
instantly what I'm talking about so the

366
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,540
default username is always instrument

367
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,480
there are three manufacturers of those

368
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,550
devices that are using this there is

369
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:35,100
always instrument user called instrument

370
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,830
and the passwords are on the websites of

371
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,470
the of the manufacturers yeah because

372
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,630
users don't want any friction in that

373
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:45,360
they spend spend for example two hundred

374
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,670
thousand pounds on this device they want

375
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,440
to plug it into the network it has to

376
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,480
work no one gives a crap about you know

377
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,480
security so they would have to every

378
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,940
time they power it on they don't have to

379
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,340
enter username and password that's

380
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,640
unacceptable like in the world it's it

381
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,730
doesn't exist it's just not possible

382
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:08,460
obviously now we know because with with

383
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,440
solution search windows hello you can

384
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,930
have password miss environments right so

385
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:14,640
you can have your password on my yubikey

386
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,670
it's pretty simple for example to have a

387
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,740
Yubikey to give to your employees and

388
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:23,220
move move the security actually

389
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,040
implement any kind of security but it's

390
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:30,750
gonna take years so if something we are

391
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,030
we are always not always but quite often

392
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:35,340
talking how the IOT is the problem

393
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,560
because people can break into IOT and

394
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,030
create botnets that would take that way

395
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:43,080
internet I'm saying oh you just have to

396
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:47,330
you just have to look for love all right

397
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:49,920
devices with so much so much processing

398
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:54,210
but that does the real danger here that

399
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:55,590
that's the danger that we are not

400
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,110
talking about enough

401
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:00,840
mostly because those are also small

402
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,520
bubbles like universities and

403
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,680
development houses they don't talk to

404
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,450
security because Security's of the

405
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:09,000
problem yeah but yeah but I think this

406
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,670
is this is the most this is the far dead

407
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,380
more dangerous problem than oil teas

408
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,020
themselves yeah I agree I I totally

409
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:16,440
agree

410
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,450
all right meadow we've got two minutes

411
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:22,560
left it goes quick once you've had an IT

412
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,660
blackout when you get back on your feet

413
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:29,160
things fly but I want to ask so you know

414
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,660
we know each other we've seen each other

415
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,960
at competition and it's always good for

416
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,260
them

417
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,110
but what in 2020 are you going to be

418
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,180
doing what's what you plant more the

419
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,860
same are you gonna be doing more

420
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:45,630
conferences speaking yes yes yes so I'm

421
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:48,530
looking forward to too many conferences

422
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:52,050
first of all as leads I hope I will be

423
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,360
working careful besides Condor which

424
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,910
means this is like the next six months

425
00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:00,720
of hard work I am turning them to big

426
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:06,360
talks one probably some mid next year

427
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,690
and the other one I hope maybe March

428
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:13,380
April one of the P sides that will be

429
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:17,160
happening so yeah my my my trance always

430
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,650
with all the conferences and speaking

431
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,270
and confesses and preparing talks

432
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,670
because I this is what I like doing the

433
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:25,710
most I like to share share the knowledge

434
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:28,770
so new stuff to new people will get them

435
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,360
into harlow security because we need

436
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,970
more people may find ways to do it

437
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:35,970
ok perfect that's great

438
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,890
so madam thank you very much for you I

439

really appreciate it thank you for

440
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,190
bearing with us when we are little tech

441
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:45,570
glitch thank you very much for having me

442
