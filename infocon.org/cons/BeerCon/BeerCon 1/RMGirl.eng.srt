1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,250
hi everyone at the moment we have with

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:07,589

3
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:10,139

4
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:12,540
too bad thanks well what about you

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,700
introduce yourself bits to our audience

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,130
and that what's what you what do you do

7
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,859
say today so the most hilarious thing is

8
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:25,019
that most people don't actually know

9
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:27,359
what my name is even though I'm not

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,090
secret about it most people think that

11
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:34,559
my name is actually a RM girl my name is

12
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,270
actually Emily Overton and records

13
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:45,210
management girl and see yeah III I

14
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:51,710
created this nickname like brand in 2015

15
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,960
so the business is nearly five years old

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,690
and purely because I was working for the

17
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,629
public sector and I was being asked to

18
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:03,239
speak and give my opinion on records

19
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:07,590
management and just like well I work for

20
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,260
the NHS or I work for the Civil Service

21
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,680
I can't really give my opinion because

22
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,780
obviously they they put your name on the

23
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:22,259
agenda as Emily Overton from the civil

24
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:29,880
service says from that point of view

25
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,939
that's always difficult to to have the

26
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:35,220
association it's funny with the Twitter

27
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,070
handles because like yeah with you

28
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,079
you're at you ever name obviously in

29
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,119
your Twitter handle but some people have

30
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:44,790
just this yeah not a real name and this

31
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,119
Lee tax Lee tax or a happy note it's

32
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:50,250
like I am following you I don't know

33
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,619
you're it's good OPSEC I think and I

34
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:58,740
feel like I should wear like a hat like

35
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,659
on a party hat that just has my Twitter

36
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:03,420
handle on it but I decided to dye my

37
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,979
hair bright red so now everyone just

38
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,340
looks for the red beacon

39
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:10,989
that's easy to recognize that's a good

40
00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:15,349
so I was curious I think you're like you

41
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:17,690
said if I'm right your background is not

42
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:20,060
information security no it's not no no

43
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:24,890
no come take over from because I say I'm

44
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,110
not I'm not a natural InfoSec person no

45
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:29,330
no but I think that's great you know why

46
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,910
because we need more people from other

47
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,310
backgrounds for instance I'm a developer

48
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,380
so yeah I know how to write code and

49
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,200
then going to info second might be the

50
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,810
more natural pad or observed as a

51
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,870
natural path but I think it's very yeah

52
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:45,650
very good

53
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,000
I have people from other domains as well

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,100
because they have insights how it's

55
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,080
going there I mean they say real

56
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,150
problems and we're like the InfoSec

57
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:56,000
people are often in this bubble and we

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,890
need to burst out of that and I think

59
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,599
it's good that we have from different

60
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,700
expertise on different domains people

61
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,040
that just can can raise the real

62
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,989
problems do you agree or definitely the

63
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:11,890
reason why I've kind of latched on to

64
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:16,790
info second not left or should I say

65
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,470
I've basically hung on to Jenny

66
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:21,470
radcliffe's boot and waiting for it to

67
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:29,480
shake me off basically is that it was a

68
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,819
mistake it's the accident I got into in

69
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:34,280
for a second as an accident I walked

70
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,560
into a meeting room one day and I said

71
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,180
oh well I like your diagrams I it means

72
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,470
this this this and this and this and

73
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,569
they went you know what we're talking

74
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:48,250
about come here sit down

75
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,370
has never been the same ever since all I

76
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,680
was doing was literally translating some

77
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:00,200
information risk heat maps and I didn't

78
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,470
know it was like I think Stuart was just

79
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,970
caught talking about it just now about

80
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:10,660
unconscious conscious unconscious

81
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,850
competence that I didn't know that I

82
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:17,060
knew the stuff that I knew I just

83
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,798
happened to regurgitate something or

84
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,130
translate something

85
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:24,720
bored sounds quite good Paris but this

86
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,370
is this is exactly what I mean these

87
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,860
insights from people not always focusing

88
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,040
on the same that's really yeah very well

89
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,370
yeah this is important I mean like I

90
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,350
said we all like our own bubble often

91
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:42,300
mainly on twitter twitter i see that and

92
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,380
people are like also really have purists

93
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,200
let's say sometimes it's not about the

94
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,330
most secure solution of course you want

95
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,950
the most secure solution but you want

96
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,680
solution that works so I've been in

97
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,640
records management for nearly 15 years

98
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,400
and it's one of those things that I

99
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,200
realized that I was just a fundamentally

100
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,900
a very sad person and when someone asked

101
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,340
me what my hobbies were and I actually

102
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,480
didn't have any other than records

103
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:17,040
management so and I realized that I was

104
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,420
one of very few people on Twitter

105
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,160
talking about records management because

106
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,510
why would you but when it came to

107
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,360
InfoSec it's a massive community and

108
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,730
that it's just out there waiting to talk

109
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,080
to you and one of the reasons why I

110
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,870
stuck around is because I'm interested

111
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,580
in inflation security because the stuff

112
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,160
that you guys are trying to protect is

113
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,850
the stuff that are looking after so I'm

114
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:48,180
interested in Records the reason why

115
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,390
InfoSec exists is because you're trying

116
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,340
to protect the records that I want to

117
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:58,830
look after so if I can I if I can like

118
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:02,460
learn some stuff from you guys so that I

119
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,530
can improve the records management I

120
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,530
don't want to win already yeah

121
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:10,140
absolutely and I'm really happy to hear

122
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,630
that because one thing I try to do is

123
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,840
this raise awareness I mean about and

124
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,200
ant user awareness I mean and it's it's

125
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,410
difficult you know because people that

126
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:26,100
need it most often don't know they need

127
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,010
it most so it's always this this yeah

128
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,260
how do you reach them as well so I I

129
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,400
think

130
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,220
well I I repeat myself again but I think

131
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,770
coming from different business and then

132
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:40,949
helping to spread that message that's

133
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:43,800
that's really powerful so and I think I

134
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,419
agree with with you the InfoSec

135
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:47,460
community is great I mean there's a lot

136
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,080
of knowledge sharing a lot of helping

137
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,919
going on so so I may I

138
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:55,800
in May I I'm gonna use the word retired

139
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,419
because I love the work for some reason

140
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:00,030
I retired as vice chair of the

141
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:00,900
information and records management

142
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,570
Society which is for me as the the

143
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,270
professional Society within the UK who

144
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,500
looks at everything information

145
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,300
governance and I came across several

146
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,770
people that were kind of dipping into

147
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,900
the RMS so one of the very first talks

148
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,940
that I saw that really struck a chord

149
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,190
with me around information security was

150
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:24,539
Stephan Bonnar and I mean he did throw a

151
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:26,610
frere Russia at my head so I'm guessing

152
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:29,450
that was a good start

153
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:35,340
he's framed for it apparently but yeah

154
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,050
it is that I went you're really

155
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,550
interesting I want to learn more about

156
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:42,419
you and it's only because people were

157
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:45,200
kind of there's that Venn diagram of

158
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,280
what I'm interested in what you're

159
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,020
interested in and what the InfoSec you

160
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,669
need to have in common with people who

161
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:52,830
are interested in records management as

162
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:57,750
a whole so I started to realize hey this

163
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,099
stuff that he's talking about is really

164
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:02,340
interesting and then as I've gone on and

165
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,070
seeing data breaches that have happened

166
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,870
I mean I got involved in dates which is

167
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,669
that the whole part of the accident side

168
00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:10,380
of things is that whilst I was in the

169
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,889
civil service I was part of a triangle

170
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:18,750
team with the IT manager who was the

171
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:25,560
kind of the InfoSec person the data

172
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,320
protection officer and me as the records

173
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,120
manager and we all between the three of

174
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,190
us we looked at every single possibility

175
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:36,539
per Hospital issue but I didn't know

176
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:40,440
enough and I needed to reach out to the

177
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,240
InfoSec community Oh guys I've got no

178
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,799
idea what I'm talking about here

179
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,170
okay I could almost feel myself kind of

180
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:49,739
thing but not actually actually saying

181
00:08:49,739 --> 00:08:58,019
anything yeah but it doesn't matter you

182
00:08:58,019 --> 00:08:59,910
you're open to learn you learn a lot I

183
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,619
mean that's what it's about and that's

184
00:09:01,619 --> 00:09:04,079
great to see and you know what one thing

185
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:07,259
I I always have the feeling is it's like

186
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:09,709
when I hear your story it's like

187
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:12,540
actually you're you roll into InfoSec it

188
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,980
was the same with me I mean as a

189
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,290
developer it may be more logic that I

190
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:19,619
need to implement secure solutions part

191
00:09:19,619 --> 00:09:21,959
of the job but take a step back when I

192
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:24,779
started at at universe when I did

193
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:27,809
University security wasn't part of

194
00:09:27,809 --> 00:09:30,959
programming let's be honest so was only

195
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,749
when I was here in my job oh we're going

196
00:09:33,749 --> 00:09:35,939
to the to the web wait what you're

197
00:09:35,939 --> 00:09:36,540
talking about

198
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,610
oh you read about data which is you're

199
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,829
thinking how can I protect our own stuff

200
00:09:40,829 --> 00:09:44,279
thanks like that so you really roll into

201
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:47,759
it and then then it's yeah you get be

202
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:50,029
bitten by it or I don't like to say them

203
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:52,829
it's one of those things like where so

204
00:09:52,829 --> 00:09:57,269
when did you ever dream of being what

205
00:09:57,269 --> 00:09:58,619
you do the job role you're doing right

206
00:09:58,619 --> 00:10:02,730
now I don't think I know any records

207
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,709
manager person that as a child that's

208
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:11,160
what they aspired to be I don't know and

209
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,589
there are some people like archivists

210
00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:15,809
for example that they went specifically

211
00:10:15,809 --> 00:10:18,749
to university to do archives and that's

212
00:10:18,749 --> 00:10:19,920
where they got themselves and that's

213
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,879
what they wanted to be I know that

214
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:22,980
anything but I don't know about the chat

215
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:27,749
in here is that if students to be a

216
00:10:27,749 --> 00:10:43,709
geography teacher you say yeah I

217
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:45,839
actually wanted to be policewoman on

218
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,589
horseback because I found fascination of

219
00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:51,029
riding it people on this big beast

220
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:54,860
whilst they're drunk funny

221
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,290
so yeah that didn't really work out

222
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:03,220
please didn't really want me but I think

223
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:07,180
yeah I I didn't dream about him and for

224
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:11,080
security job when either sir so I I

225
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,060
don't know I always wanted to do

226
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,740
something with computers from early on

227
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,680
but then again InfoSec it it's it's it's

228
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,410
also sometimes a lonely job I mean

229
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:22,960
you're you're the you're the emphasize

230
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,610
the security guy and you have to bring

231
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:28,210
bad news and it's not always the best

232
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:30,220
kind of circumstances but still I love

233
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:34,140
it so it's the skies kind of strange

234
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,730
just saying he wants to be a spy or

235
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:43,030
fighter pilot yeah it's not exactly the

236
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,550
career that you kind of plan I don't

237
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:48,610
think exactly that that's what I tried

238
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:54,490
to say yeah ghost like that it seems

239
00:11:54,490 --> 00:12:02,350
logical we saw a mass on teh intake of

240
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,540
people that were data protection offices

241
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:07,450
I can't imagine being 10 in school good

242
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:10,210
to know what I want to be a data

243
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:13,930
protection officer make privacy they're

244
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:19,150
sexy again no it's also no no fun job it

245
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,850
could be a great job but but the message

246
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,350
you have to bring is awesome not funny

247
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:27,100
or your what you say is that my tagline

248
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:32,620
my one dream that I I started nearly 15

249
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,120
years ago when I realized I quite like

250
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,190
records records management was I wanted

251
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:39,760
to make records management sexy yeah but

252
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,680
I think that's a good approach I mean

253
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,020
yeah it's like that also for information

254
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,600
security a lot of people just think it's

255
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,510
it's yeah they think only about the

256
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,520
negative side where you get security

257
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,800
incidents in them it's not lonely that

258
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,810
you can improve a lot of things and can

259
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,270
be rewarding even the smallest one can

260
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:03,610
be rewarding and if you don't celebrate

261
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:06,280
the small win yeah it's probably not a

262
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,800
job for you because it's not giant leaps

263
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,800
by step improving stuff and it's my

264
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,310
opinion at least my experience those

265
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,630
guys in the chat right now basically

266
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,000
saying that that I make records Michael

267
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,040
sexy and the records management equals

268
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,560
hot and I'm like you guys you need a

269
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:31,180
life they're just throwing us or you

270
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:37,630

so yeah is that with my interesting kind

273
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:52,720
of InfoSec kind of like just a name drop

274
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,980
a couple of people that I find

275
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,750
fascinating you know it's like I've

276
00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:00,070
already mentioned Jenny Radcliffe but

277
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,050
also people like Becky King card and

278
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:05,800
Professor Danny in fact first Danny's

279
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,110
actually invited me to speak to his

280
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:11,019
students next year that are actually

281
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:13,390
doing their cybersecurity universities

282
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:17,260
degree and I'm gonna go and talk to her

283
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,950
about records management I'm so excited

284
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:22,329
just because I just think people need to

285
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:24,040
know more about records management and

286
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:28,839
the life cycle just so they can see

287
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,290
where info SEC has publicus the three so

288
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:35,020
I'm just gonna do you must selling

289
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,370
picture around records management three

290
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,529
main things about records management is

291
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:40,480
knowing what you've got why you've got

292
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,550
it and how long you need to keep it and

293
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:50,200
the whole thing with InfoSec is that if

294
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,079
you don't know what you've got what are

295
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:55,320
you spending your money on protecting

296
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,079
yeah exactly exactly I think that's

297
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:01,750
that's a lot a lot of companies have

298
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,120
assets they really not know about and

299
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,070
the hackers are not the heck knows the

300
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:09,540
criminals they they will find it easily

301
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:13,300
online tools and then that's really if

302
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,180
you think about it how bad how bad is

303
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,279
that but it's also understandable

304
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:21,010
there's a lot of outdated systems

305
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:21,820
there's there's a

306
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,910
shado 18 so what you say is yes so true

307
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:28,210
I mean and then that goes beyond the

308
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:30,700
tech companies that's for every company

309
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:34,600
it's so easy nowadays to find sweet

310
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,120
recently in in your company if it was in

311
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,680
I think that they were caught out on

312
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,030
excessive retention of data I know it's

313
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:48,910
just like yeah records management is

314
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,040
getting there it's getting there cool

315
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,950
guys but that is just it is that you've

316
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,750
got a data breach and that data breaches

317
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,340
records that stuff that should have been

318
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,560
managed with records management so why

319
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,210
on info second records management

320
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,640
talking more together why is it why

321
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,130
aren't we holding hands a lot more said

322
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:11,350
the odd Jenny yeah why aren't we weren't

323
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,600
why aren't people learning more about

324
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,460
records management is it because it's

325
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:18,820
still seen as filing is it still seen as

326
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:22,090
the data that we don't have time to look

327
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:29,320
at it's yeah you're right I think also

328
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,910
InfoSec people should look more to

329
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:36,730
always a lot of people are just yeah in

330
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:39,430
their own bubble they're they're always

331
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:40,870
focusing on us and they should learn

332
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:43,180
from other types of businesses as well

333
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,790
not only that companies over and just

334
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:48,400
see where yeah there are so many

335
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,920
similarities we can learn from we can

336
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,900
learn from mistakes from others or best

337
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,940
practices from others I think that's

338
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,650
that's a very important lesson here to

339
00:16:56,650 --> 00:17:00,730
make so yeah totally agree and she was

340
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:03,190
just mentioned in the chat about if

341
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,079
there's a porn for it let's make records

342
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:09,250
management sexy again and she did do a

343
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,140
blog post about porn and records

344
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,000
management because I was trying to teach

345
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,829
my housemate why I did for a job okay

346
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:19,439
good [ __ ] sharing on Twitter and their

347
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,450
ages ago

348
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:24,359
and it's definitely not safe for work

349
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:27,690
and read your own okay but but it's

350
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:28,140
Sunday

351
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,230
I guess it's Saturday okay for now just

352
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,670
because anyone's listening to this right

353
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:34,320
now and thinks it's a great idea to what

354
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,320
to read it on their work computer was

355
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,310
there I don't know there might be

356
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:41,280
listening to this as a as a podcast or

357
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,650
whatever yes okay so Emily we have a few

358
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,540
minutes left maybe it's not so quick

359
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:54,300
yeah but maybe just what I what did you

360
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,180
learn or what were the moments that made

361
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,930
the most impression on you and 2019 what

362
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:03,660
do you think will be the trends or what

363
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,630
do you see for 2020 more of the same or

364
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:09,630
you expect something more and more

365
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,510
records management issues in related to

366
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,190
info sex so whether that be data

367
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:16,320
breaches or just not enough time and

368
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,480
attention to the records not knowing

369
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,720
where stuff is and like GDP has been

370
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,000
very slow I mean it's been 18 months of

371
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,750
GDP our least I can't do math you still

372
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:34,860
haven't seen any kind of teeth on any

373
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:39,810
kind of from actual phones so maybe

374
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:42,660
hopefully that will come I say maybe

375
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,370
hopefully I'm not hopeful at all because

376
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,720
they just don't I don't have very much

377
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,370
in confidence in it at the minute but

378
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:54,540
hopefully that will come and we will

379
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,880
start seeing more and more attention

380
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,020
drawn to records like that I mean if

381
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,000
anybody at their InfoSec events is

382
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,400
looking for a records management speaker

383
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,500
I'm more than happy to go out there and

384
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,940
talk about it and yeah again if you have

385
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,830
students as well I'm happy to go and

386
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,630
speak to them because I think people

387
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,130
need to know about records management

388
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:18,150
and the trends be ready for it before it

389
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:21,300
actually happens and don't be sad

390
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,500
they're going actually I don't know what

391
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,640
records management is

392
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,470
I yes I'm getting distracted sorry no

393
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:35,650
worries I think it's about time to wrap

394
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,480
up and I want to thank you what's very

395

00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:44,040
