do is I check down a couple of cans of

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,220
energy drinks Wow okay fantastic

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,250
so used to off air there we were talking

9
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,920
in a green room because the many hats

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,880
Club does look after us we were talking

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,170
about how Joe the previous guests really

12
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,559
had a huge impact on you Kim and and you

13
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,840
said that you'd be glad to sing his

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,579
praises a little bit so Tony yeah

15
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:50,360
listening to Joe and he is very much

16
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,430
responsible for the career success that

17
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:58,739
I have now back in 2016 he decided to

18
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:01,260
publish my women and information

19
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,610
security interview series okay and got

20
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,700
me a lot of attention and that led to

21
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,080
gigs with silence and AT&T and identify

22
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,909
and so on

23
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,030
and I'm always gonna be grateful for him

24
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,280
because he's the one who gave me a

25
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,640
chance that's that's a great and an

26
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,820
amazing and touching story and I think

27
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,140
one of the things that you just said

28
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,540
which was which I guess some people

29
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,020
might find a little bit shocking is

30
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,729
there were women in information security

31
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:42,299
in 2016 oh no I thought this was just a

32
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:44,549
new thing so Kim why don't you tell us a

33
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:46,020
little bit about your perspective of

34
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,909
this industry and kind of how it's

35
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:50,720
evolved for good or for bad

36
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,720
hey I think I think our industry in

37
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,990
general has been improving and I'm very

38
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,079
happy to see you know good gender mix of

39
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,799
guests on beer con so that's agree yeah

40
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,429
so that things are looking up I'm seeing

41
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:10,619
more people of color also in the

42
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:12,290
industry and and

43
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:15,140
gender people what not so I'm really

44
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,510
optimistic because that diversity

45
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,939
benefits the industry we need all kinds

46
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:23,510
of different perspectives cybersecurity

47
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,469
is largely a humanities domain so we

48
00:02:27,469 --> 00:02:29,989
need all of those different perspectives

49
00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:33,620
I agree a wholeheartedly and it's

50
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,150
interesting because you're a very strong

51
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:41,599
advocate for a fairly large group of

52
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,599
folks that suffer from from from mental

53
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:47,090
disorder and you've been an outspoken

54
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,340
advocate about that so why don't you

55
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,079
tell us your story a little bit about

56
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:54,169
you know how you went from from you know

57
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:56,900
suffering to now being an advocate and a

58
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:01,519
very strong voice in the community Ian I

59
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,040
I know you I know you're a great guy I

60
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,599
know that your heart is in the right

61
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,810
place in our community we don't really

62
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:12,439
like using the word suffering okay yeah

63
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:14,840
I just I know I know your hearts in the

64
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,699
right place and your good intention so I

65
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:18,799
just thought I'd let you know about that

66
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:24,019
okay I ever since I was really really

67
00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:26,359
little I knew that there was something

68
00:03:26,359 --> 00:03:29,269
different about my brain doctor and it

69
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:35,510
made my life very difficult my my older

70
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:38,090
sister Victoria suspected that I was

71
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:42,470
autistic nurse - and her mother because

72
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,650
she's actually my half-sister her mother

73
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,739
was a special education teacher and she

74
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:51,129
voted for that idea that I was autistic

75
00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:55,900
but my dad would not hear about it I was

76
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,449
hyper like sick which means that I was

77
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:01,239
speaking in full sentences and

78
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:05,260
sophisticated language early in life and

79
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,970
my dad just wanted to believe that I

80
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:10,009
wasn't super brilliant little girl he

81
00:04:10,009 --> 00:04:12,530
did not want to believe that his

82
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,159
daughter could be mentally disabled so

83
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:17,870
there were a lot of times in my life

84
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,940
where I almost got diagnosed with

85
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,500
Asperger's syndrome or autism or ADHD

86
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,260
and I miss

87
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,380
because of ableism and ignorance and

88
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,880
then eventually at age 35 I started

89
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,400
making enough money that I could pay for

90
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,360
my own private psychology services so

91
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,940
that's what I did about a year ago and I

92
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,210
find me got a formal diagnosis and I was

93
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:48,150
surprised that it was both autism and

94
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:53,160
ADHD both diagnosis is the same time and

95
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,990
somehow through that incredibly

96
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,420
challenging journey you ended up being

97
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,820
one of I would say one of the top

98
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,520
InfoSec journalists widely read

99
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,540
especially in the silence blog globally

100
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:09,690
so it's a huge huge accomplishment thank

101
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:10,710
you very much

102
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,260
I'm very busy like I I work for a lot of

103
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,660
different vendors that you all know and

104
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:20,100
I mean I I'm really blessed like my

105
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:24,810
career is so great I love my job so much

106
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,140
it gives me a feeling of purpose I love

107
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,530
learning about cybersecurity every day

108
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,620
just a little bit more my job is

109
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,660
basically it's like gaming University

110
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,760
student but you're paid to be a

111
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,860
university student you're paid to learn

112
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,930
you're paid to study you're paid for

113
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,870
your essays where if you know a lot of

114
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,600
people they go to university or college

115
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,780
and they don't get paid for it it does

116
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,970
be like the reverse effect right they go

117
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:58,920
and eat that so so I'm really happy to

118
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,780
be a paid student and I'm always eager

119
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,970
to learn every day well you figured out

120
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:07,020
how to hack the system can I ask you a

121
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,030
question

122
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:11,730
so obviously you observe and that's you

123
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,350
spend a lot of time observing the things

124
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:16,410
and the goings-on in the industry and

125
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,600
then you write and you express you know

126
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,400
your interpretations and things that are

127
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,650
happening in the world have you got any

128
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,870
examples of way you you found a story

129
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,000
really difficult to write or whether

130
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,070
it's been a real shake my head moment

131
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,480
and the information that you've been

132
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,990
sharing with people oh yeah well when I

133
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:37,440
find my job challenging it's not like

134
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,110
it's not psychological

135
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:43,370
it's purely I'm rating highly technical

136
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,789
documentation yeah and sometimes it's

137
00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:48,530
about technologies that haven't existed

138
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:54,259
for very long and I've got to focus on

139
00:06:54,259 --> 00:06:56,300
what I'm reading but at the same time if

140
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,550
my brain starts feeling like it's gonna

141
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:01,400
hurt take a break and then come up come

142
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,289
back to the research material later on

143
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:04,159
sure

144
00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:06,560
so it's never psychological it's more

145
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,560
mental I think the most difficult thing

146
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,259
that I wrote recently was that DNS over

147
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:16,819
HTTP thing that I wrote for benefice

148
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:19,699
book right because that is a very new

149
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:21,860
technology and a lot of people were very

150
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,169
eager to read about it because there's

151
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:26,389
not a lot of information about it online

152
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:29,509
yeah yeah and because there's not hard

153
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:32,569
for information about online yet the web

154
00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:35,090
was not sufficient research I would

155
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:39,169
Google terms relevant to the topic to

156
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:41,689
see what information I could find and I

157
00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:43,490
found a lot of the search results that

158
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,289
were coming back were things that I

159
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:46,069
wrote

160
00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:49,909
oh wow it's like [ __ ] I can't preference

161
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:53,300
myself I can't just there's a certain

162
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,589
level of arrogance when you reference

163
00:07:54,589 --> 00:08:01,039
yourself you know you guys on Twitter

164
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,159
like the infoset community were very

165
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:06,620
very useful to me we had some teams

166
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:10,029
where I asked questions about very

167
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:12,139
specific questions about it the

168
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:14,560
implementation of TLS certificates

169
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,000
mm-hmm and I thought I got good answers

170
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,449
and that was how I was able to write

171
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:23,389
that piece based on good information I

172
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:27,379
mean it's great I have a lot of the

173
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:30,319
world's top experts in various different

174
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,260
facets of cybersecurity on my

175
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:37,070
metaphorical rolodex yeah yeah so I love

176
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,110
having that as a resource and learning

177
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,899
from all those specialists because I

178
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:44,420
will never be a specialist for the sake

179
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,029
of my job I always must be a generalist

180
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:49,399
Sheryl so if I if I have a specific

181
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:52,420
question about IOT secure

182
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,910
pretty for instance I can go to I can go

183
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:58,180
to Stupak right if I have a specific

184
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:01,000
question about network security I can go

185
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,110
to you Ian excited I'm a bad idea I

186
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:08,050
write emails no but thank you for that

187
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:10,029
and it's so kind of you to say that and

188
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:13,329
yes as a community I think we love to

189
00:09:13,329 --> 00:09:14,949
support people that have the desire to

190
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:18,630
learn do you think though that you know

191
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:22,690
sort of what's what's Kim 3.0 are you

192
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,639
thinking about a book are you thinking

193
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:27,790
about you know more community activism

194
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:30,130
or where where's your comfort level

195
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:33,430
these days I think on one level I'm

196
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,050
gonna keep doing what I'm doing right

197
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:40,029
now until the day I die okay I like the

198
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:43,079
consistency and I really like my job

199
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:47,829
without getting into too many details I

200
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:51,970
am being well I'm being considered for

201
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:54,880
other positions more authority right now

202
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,980
nice and I'm also gonna work on my own

203
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:03,490
sort of creative online media project

204
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:08,290
great 2020 I don't want to go into too

205
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,300
many details about that right now I want

206
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:14,649
a lot of that but I am you know you're

207
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:21,339
with the beer farmers under embargo but

208
00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:24,370
I am working on some fun content that

209
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:27,010
doesn't have anything to do with any of

210
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:30,010
my work for vendors you know and this is

211
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,750
a really great sort of segue into my

212
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,329
next question is what his downtime is

213
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:36,339
really important you talked about

214
00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:42,190
resting your brain do you see I think a

215
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:45,310
hyperness or a craziness of this

216
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:49,149
industry just driving people you know

217
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,240
harder are we losing our humanity in

218
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,060
this industry you know from your

219
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:58,449
perspective you will never hear a more

220
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:01,810
enthusiastic advocate for work-life

221
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:05,660
balance me okay I've had

222
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,420
to me and they see how many defenders

223
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:11,870
and working with simultaneously and they

224
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,060
say wow you must be working a hundred

225
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,610
hours a week then you work for like five

226
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,980
different companies right now and I'm

227
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,680
like no I don't work a hundred hours a

228
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,460
week he'd be surprised I actually very

229
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,710
rarely work more than thirty hours a

230
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:32,450
week but but the fact that you know a

231
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,370
lot of weeks I only work 20 hours

232
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:39,260
right because the work that I do for one

233
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,270
vendor might only take me four hours in

234
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:46,880
a week right the fact that I have so

235
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,220
much time for rest and relaxation is not

236
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,750
reflective of me being so much smarter

237
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,740
than other people

238
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,200
it's a reflector of me being a lot

239
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,200
luckier than other people if you're a

240
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,950
corporate drone you cannot plan your own

241
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,830
schedule you can't say to your boss oh I

242
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,770
only want to work ten hours a week

243
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,030
they're going to say no you have to come

244
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,650
into the office for these hours and

245
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:16,430
that's final right and it's a privilege

246
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:19,640
that I have being well compensated by

247
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,830
the companies I work for and being

248
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:25,880
self-employed but if you can live like

249
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:30,020
me and have time off and have rest and

250
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,780
relaxation and have a life outside of

251
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:36,170
your job then you should do it I really

252
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:39,440
don't like Calvinism and I really don't

253
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,460
like people saying that you know working

254
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,380
80 hours a week working a hundred hours

255
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,990
a week is honorable it's not you will

256
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:52,010
kill yourself doing that my job is great

257
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:55,820
I love my job but I also love sleeping

258
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:59,000
and I love you know watching Netflix and

259
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,400
playing video games and spending time

260
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,220
with my sexy Rockstar boyfriend you know

261
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,580
and did no job is worth doing a hundred

262
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:11,810
hours a week some wise advice and you

263
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,240
might be one of the few

264
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,670
in InfoSec that has come on and publicly

265
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,120
stated that they love their job it's

266
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,540
probably because I do only work 20 to 30

267
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,300
hours a week yeah but and that's that's

268
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,900
tremendous so Canada you're Canadian

269
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:32,770
yeah how do you see Canadian information

270
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,350
security versus the the global stage

271
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:38,500
because you tap into the two global

272
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,080
companies you tap into local global

273
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,070
resources how's Canada do it I am really

274
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:47,590
optimistic I mean one of the companies I

275
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:50,470
work for is blackberry I've worked for

276
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,110
blackberry ever since they fired silence

277
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:56,530
and we all know that their headquarters

278
00:13:56,530 --> 00:14:00,400
is at Waterloo and thanks to the

279
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,360
University of Waterloo and thanks to

280
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,180
blackberry being based in Waterloo we

281
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,660
have a very promising tech sector right

282
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:16,180
here in southern Ontario I live in the

283
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:19,570
heart of Toronto and for those who are

284
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,790
completely ignorant of the geography

285
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:24,970
here Waterloo is about an hour and a

286
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,250
half to two hour drive from here that's

287
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:31,720
right oh yeah I'm sure that there are a

288
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,480
lot of smart people who are retiring

289
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,850
from blackberry and they're forming

290
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,980
their own little small tech companies

291
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,620
and there are you know BlackBerry has

292
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,320
invested a lot in the University of

293
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,630
Waterloo so there are people coming out

294
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:49,270
of those educational programs starting

295
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,580
their own businesses so I'm very

296
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,470
optimistic about Canada we're in a great

297
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:58,180
position here yeah certainly a vehicle

298
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,630
of a tech company that that dates back

299
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,690
to the the BlackBerry Nortel Network

300
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:05,980
days

301
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,470
so that's but what happened in the hotel

302
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,200
that happening people who worked for

303
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,570
Nortel in the 80s and they're so angry

304
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,220
they're so sad

305
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:19,270
yeah that's it's a heck of a story that

306
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,400
you know is slowly unfolding as we as we

307
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,820
peer deeper into wow way and a global

308
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,910
espionage

309
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:28,610
which I grew up in Mississauga Ontario

310
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,760
when I was a little kid and the

311
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,210
Mississauga skyline had a fake glass

312
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:38,210
office tower on Roberts Beck Parkway and

313
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:41,390
it had the Nortel lobe on top of it and

314
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:44,210
I remember seeing it all throughout my

315
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:47,870
early childhood and when I was a grade

316
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:50,780
school kid that was a prominent part of

317
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,480
Mississauga skyline so it is kind of

318
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,790
personal to me

319
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:57,620
so let me let me ask you sort of the

320
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,300
question about balancing sort of

321
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,630
journalistic integrity versus you know

322
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:05,930
writing for vendor blogs how do you

323
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,580
balance sort of the need to obviously

324
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:10,160
you know create a bit of a commercial

325
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,110
product that you know feeds the the

326
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:17,450
company you know leads and stuff like

327
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:18,890
that but at the same time sort of

328
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:24,260
maintain a journalistic approach to what

329
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,760
you're doing do you ever find yourself

330
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,630
sort of at odds I know for certain that

331
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,410
I work under marketing departments I

332
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:35,600
also do consider myself a journalist

333
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,640
because I do engage in the actor

334
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,880
journalism it is kind of a tightrope you

335
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,400
know all of the information on those

336
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:48,290
vendored bugs is good but I mean none of

337
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,050
us are naive here like there's never

338
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:53,510
going to be information on a vendor's

339
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,760
blog that's unflattering to the vendor

340
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,390
no of course and but yeah I've seen

341
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,760
great ideas for stories like certain

342
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,770
strains of malware that were discovered

343
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:06,500
or whatever and pitched it to editors

344
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,199
and the editors had to remind me of oh

345
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,180
that research is coming from a competing

346
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,579
company I'm sorry you can't write like

347
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:16,699
that here but yet somehow you leverage

348
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:18,470
your relationships to get this amazing

349
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:22,069
coverage for cyber Titan from from

350
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:24,500
silence which you know blew my mind

351
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,630
Khem that you're that you were able to

352
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:29,390
create an innovation ship with Anthony

353
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:32,780
and Natasha yeah at silence and Anthony

354
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,390
I believe has recently been promoted to

355
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,250
the head of online content for all of

356
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,560
library

357
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:43,220
and I consider those people to be my

358
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,260
friends just like I consider Joe to be

359
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:48,110

fellow Canadians looking out yeah it is

365
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:06,320
very much about who you know about what

366
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,530
you don't know but once your foot is in

367
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,450
the door you know in this industry

368
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:14,480
everyone knows each other that's so true

369
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,580
so don't be a dick that's our motto

370
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:23,030
isn't it yeah yeah absolutely right

371
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:25,010
we've got a couple of minutes left Kim

372
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:27,740
it's been fascinating listening to you

373
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,860
and even kind of alluded to earlier in a

374
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,170
question but what's 2020 gonna look like

375
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:35,090
for you in your life and that can be

376
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:39,290
obviously you weren't live here of life

377
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:43,700
I moved to a nice new apartment this

378
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,380
building is very new like it's finished

379
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,780
construction like about a month before I

380
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:52,940
moved in code because I moved to this

381
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:56,090
new apartment I now have a space that's

382
00:18:56,090 --> 00:19:04,490
conducive for YouTube because now I have

383
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,470
privacy and I have a nice-looking place

384
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:09,140
I have a place that now looks nice on

385
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:12,080
camera and I privacy and I don't have to

386
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,840
worry about some roommate interrupted me

387
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,780
I live here completely alone look like

388
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:23,630
the new media projects in 2020 the

389
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,880
apartment is a part of that quite

390
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,830
honestly because that's where both

391
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,690
youtubers work they work out of their

392
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:35,210
own homes right yeah yeah so yeah sounds

393
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:39,470
exciting yeah so I think I mean you know

394
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,920
I've kept on working for silence an AT&T

395
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,550
cybersecurity and verify and I started

396
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,920
working for dispersed key for Kaspersky

397
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,280
secure future I started working for them

398
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,300
last autumn

399
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,240
I want to see those business

400
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,180
relationships continue all throughout

401
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:03,920
2020 and 2021 so so I think 2020 is

402
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,290
gonna be much of the same plus some new

403
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,380
projects but there's not going to be

404
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:11,780
anything good in 2019 that there wasn't

405
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,980
in 2012

406
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:18,470
yeah exciting to see the output

407
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:20,840
definitely absolutely as I'm looking

408
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,940
forward to going to cyber Titan in May

409
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:27,380
yeah it's coming on strong I really

410
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,840
