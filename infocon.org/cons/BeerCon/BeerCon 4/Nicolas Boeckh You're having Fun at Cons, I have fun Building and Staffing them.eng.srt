1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,860
and hello so give me a second I need to

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,859
do my own AV for five seconds so

3
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:09,120
here we go

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,460
right

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,300
there we go

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,199
there we go

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,740
so welcome everyone to this talk which

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,960
is a conference talk about running and

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,439
Staffing in full set conferences

10
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:30,779
or how I put it giving a talk about

11
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:32,520
running conferences at a conference that

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,719
is taking place inside a bigger

13
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,000
conference that I'm partly running this

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,760
one yeah not DTX whilst also discussing

15
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,020
said conference using assets and

16
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,420
pictures from said conference

17
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,480
mind blown yet we're getting there so

18
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,440
what is this

19
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,059
uh when I'm talking about infosight

20
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:49,739
conferences specifically not necessarily

21
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:52,140
vendor conferences not software not

22
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,020
let's restrain the scope slightly

23
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,120
uh it's a bunch of personal stories

24
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,340
perspectives because well I'll get into

25
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,640
it but I do also run my own conference

26
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,540
Beyond also helping out this one

27
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,520
uh and it's also a slight fourth wall

28
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,260
break because hey talking about

29
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,640
conferences at a conference maybe

30
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,780
perhaps

31
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,479
and it's also very much a post

32
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:17,280
uh which is perfect for a closing

33
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,020
keynote I guess

34
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,000
so what isn't this

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,340
it isn't an infotech talk per se even

36
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,500
though this is you know the beer farmer

37
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,080
cyber security there we go it's not an

38
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,759
infosec talk per se

39
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,220
it isn't a self-congratulatory bunch of

40
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,220
roses thrown my way I'd love to but I

41
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,140
don't do that so there you go

42
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,079
and it is definitely not vendor uh

43
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,140
 hi everyone uh

44
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,619
snake oil or academic shenanigans

45
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:48,299
so

46
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:51,180
few disclaimers first of all uh none

47
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,220
about my employer I'm not gonna name and

48
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,020
shame any conferences if anyone's done

49
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,240
something bad I am not going to say they

50
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,700
 up unless it's me perhaps

51
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,860
uh I only have a limited visibility I've

52
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,020
only been in this field or at least

53
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,820
attending cyber security conferences for

54
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,098
the last two years ish give or take two

55
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:09,119
and a half years

56
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,400
uh most of that if you haven't

57
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,780
remembered or if you're choosing to

58
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,739
ignore it what's covered so this is my

59
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:19,140
actually second physical conference I've

60
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,160
attended

61
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,660
so there you go

62
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,180
and yeah you will also be subjected to

63
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,819
some of my stupid inane wacky

64
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:31,620
oops so who am I I'm Nicos

65
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,000
uh

66
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,940
if you were there yesterday

67
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,560
that this is also Nikos it's just the

68
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,140
other Nikos uh no one that comes out at

69
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,280
night

70
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,800
uh I do some software engineering some

71
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,900
applications engineering depending on

72
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,200
you know yeah maybe ish on the side I do

73
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,680
studies uh I perform Samosa and I help

74
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,120
manage a community called digital

75
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,879
overdose and I build ctfs and I also

76
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,340
attend them uh and such I have a lot of

77
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,900
free time

78
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,360
and I do stupid fun things such as give

79
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,319
this talk

80
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,500
um and also Perhaps Perhaps Perhaps uh

81
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,120
run my own conference

82
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,640
so I've been around not that around this

83
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,060
around uh been involved in a few ctfs

84
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,340
abstract Village uh besides Newcastle

85
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,760
trans stack tent coming up in a week uh

86
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,739
Ninja overdose once more Miracle 3 hope

87
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:24,000
you're gone four

88
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,340
guess where that's at uh besides

89
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,620
Newcastle 21 play secure may contain

90
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,000
hackers blah blah blah blah blah there's

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,080
a line

92
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,360
so let's take a small peek behind the

93
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,300
curtain of conferences because hey

94
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,640
you enjoy attending conferences I enjoy

95
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,620
building and Staffing them

96
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,140
full circle so a conference timeline is

97
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,840
pretty much this you have the idea part

98
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,220
of the conference

99
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,140
okay which takes time you build an

100
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,180
identity you build a brand you build a

101
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,760
website you build some social media-ish

102
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,920
you have a cfp process where you collect

103
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,040
presentation ideas and potentially go a

104
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,480
little bit more into detail

105
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,720
uh you review that cfp uh so I call for

106
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,580
a presentation or call for uh well

107
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,459
presenter uh or papers depending on if

108
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:10,680
you're in academy or not then you have a

109
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,319
small preparation bit so mentoring on

110
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,959
the side of the speakers if they need it

111
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,418
uh event communication

112
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:21,079
you know tweeting about stuff

113
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,280
preparing Assets Now if you're the beer

114
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,780
Farmers you just put 24 hours here

115
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,400
instead of a month

116
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,400
hi

117
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,759
and uh yeah and like after the

118
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:34,259
conference yeah the postcon where you do

119
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:37,199
stuff with swag so you know stuff uh you

120
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,880
do some video editing if you need to you

121
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,340
can make your results if you want to uh

122
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,780
you collect some sponsors all along the

123
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,419
way you try to at least and you maintain

124
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:46,919
a website where you maintain stuff up to

125
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,180
date

126
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,000
so speaking about identity of things

127
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,220
let's go through these steps so a

128
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,840
concept is kind of you know what the con

129
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,120
is about who is the target audience uh

130
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,680
who are the target speakers what are the

131
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,120
objectives like are you trying to teach

132
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,320
someone something or you're trying to

133
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,900
pull some Fender or you know

134
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,820
there you go

135
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,220
um so you you build a bit of an identity

136
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,500
so here we have the beer Farmers uh I

137
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,300
told we didn't rip this asset from my

138
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,960
 folder

139
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,919
there seems to be a trend

140
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,340
mostly orange to Yellow

141
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,740
um so you provide a scaffold you have a

142
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,320
code of conduct or a website rules Etc

143
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,160
uh social media style guide a timeline

144
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,639
Etc okay and you designed the thing the

145
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:36,780
thing is where you're actually all

146
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,160
sitting right now or watching from on

147
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,900
Twitch hopefully I didn't kill the

148
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,740
stream uh and yeah that's pretty much it

149
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,320
the cfp itself is well

150
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,720
you need to communicate it to get

151
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,460
presentations in

152
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,860
so it's a process it takes time uh you

153
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,620
need to get it out there to a variety of

154
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,380
people because if you get uh 30 sales

155
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,139
people up here or 30 people that only do

156
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:02,639
devsec Ops

157
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,220
or only do kubernetes

158
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,680
I mean not slagging kubecon they do

159
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,860
fantastic stuff but like

160
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,380
yeah they're also way more skilled at

161
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,520
that than I am so they probably have

162
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,780
ideas

163
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,479
uh and yeah you will also have a bunch

164
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,280
of snake oil vendors or con bunnies who

165
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,720
will also apply

166
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,120
con button is this kind of like

167
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,759
um when you have a music show a festival

168
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,800
you will always have the same people

169
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,020
always like jumping from one to the

170
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,539
other and oftentimes they might not be

171
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:35,759
so fantastic people to have around cfps

172
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,680
have the same problem

173
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,419
so you have a preparation time the

174
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:42,120
assets as I mentioned uh this is an

175
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,100
asset from burcon 4. so if you're

176
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,020
watching this from home

177
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,419
this presentation is going to be inside

178
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:51,000
this presentation fun

179
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,940
slightly fun

180
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,520
right optionally if uh your speakers

181
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,900
need it you have some mentoring around

182
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,979
you know

183
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:00,780
helps to

184
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,300
help newer speakers get there

185
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,800
Mark slightly or at least not be

186
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,960
disoriented or at least try on their

187
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,639
talks it's nice

188
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,539
and you have staff hijair hi Dave hi the

189
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:14,340
bear farmers

190
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,860
um hi Andy

191
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,080
I saw this there

192
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,360
uh so yeah and uh fantastic people that

193
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,759
will help you make it be good

194
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,740
the con itself

195
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,900
you need some stage magic so here we

196
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,000
have an actual stage fantastic

197
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,780
uh you have small fires such as uh small

198
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,060
issues with timing small issues with uh

199
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,000
ambient noise small issues with people

200
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,340
running around screaming that's not

201
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,740
happened actually so very good then you

202
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,780
have big fires things that might

203
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,919
actually cause you to Halt the

204
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:49,199
conference such as I don't know pressing

205
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,780
stop streaming accidentally it's

206
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,699
happened or things actually Catching

207
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:54,720
Fire

208
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,940
don't

209
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,580
um so yeah you have a setup looks a bit

210
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,139
terrible this is from another conference

211
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:03,539
is digital overdose

212
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:05,940
this is here where you will actually

213
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,039
notice that this is the slide that we're

214
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:10,979
currently on just without the images

215
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:13,860
just know when I did these slides

216
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,900
so uh the post con happens just by

217
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,940
releasing the video so whatever we're

218
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,860
recording here

219
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,080
um so for example CCC has the CCC

220
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,759
production house

221
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,500
brilliant people they'll get it out in

222
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,240
like two or three days uh

223
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,460
we try to match our efficacy bear

224
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,339
Farmers also do it's a process

225
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:36,299
uh you have swagonomics which is don't

226
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:37,559
Google that don't get to Urban

227
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,179
Dictionary definition because it is the

228
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:41,039
wrong definition and I'm way too white

229
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,240
to say it

230
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,540
uh but it is dealing with swag As in

231
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,940
sending packets out to speakers sending

232
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,779
stuff t-shirts stickers

233
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:53,339
and then you have Aftercare which is

234
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:54,959
basically just

235
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,620
yeah not that one the other one where

236
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,240
you actually talk to them and see that

237
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,120
hey are they happy with you know how the

238
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,620
talk was recorded

239
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,240
Etc or do they want to censor a bit

240
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,860
because hey they got a cecent desist

241
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,000
letter

242
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,220
it's happened

243
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,220
um yeah fun stories uh I mean fun this

244
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,779
this kind of fun not the not the real

245
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:18,120
fun the real fun comes after

246
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,620
so yeah people that are too cool for

247
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,820
rules

248
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,800
I'm terrible at

249
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,860
memes so there you go uh you do not want

250
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,720
the person to be don't read this it's

251
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,160
useless

252
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,720
um you don't want to be the person that

253
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,000
gets the code of conduct from this size

254
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,680
to this size

255
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,560
you do not want to be that person

256
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,480
because hey people that are volunteering

257
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,360
are volunteering sure Dave Andy they're

258
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,100
Farmers

259
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,019
um don't disrespect don't be an ass

260
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:51,800
typical stuff right yeah you'd think

261
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:54,300
um cfps are fun

262
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,980
um in the sense that hey people will

263
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,620
just brain pray some conferences as they

264
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,540
can send their cfp in everywhere

265
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,279
and then you have people that go like at

266
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:03,540
a rookie conference so they didn't even

267
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,180
bother reading hey I spoke at uh can I

268
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,760
see apps that California guricon Balkan

269
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,140
et cetera et cetera et cetera list goes

270
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,240
on I'm like no thank you mate

271
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,839
uh you have a large amount of volume

272
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,160
there you go

273
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,260
and then you also have snake oil which

274
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,820
is why you have a cfp review process

275
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,980
which needs to filter out the snake oil

276
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,620
and the vendors and the

277
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,459
yeah it's it's a process as I said

278
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:32,040
content guides uh so Style Guidelines

279
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,140
you know a style sheet now that this is

280
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,880
very rich coming from me because my

281
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,920
style sheet is this

282
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,640
I start is there enough neon no add more

283
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,040
neon is there enough hexagons no add

284
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,480
more hexagons that's it that's my style

285
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,279
sheet

286
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,620
um so yeah have a fun color palette I

287
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,079
have a social media plan have some place

288
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,839
to share these things you know like I

289
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:56,880
don't know speaker cards Etc where

290
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,980
everyone can access it on the team I

291
00:10:58,980 --> 00:10:59,880
mean

292
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,459
you have AV issues uh so let's say the

293
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:03,839
con space

294
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,820
it's loud

295
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,700
we had hum yesterday we have a bit of

296
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,100
ambient noise we need to deal with this

297
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,680
especially when you know I'm not an

298
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,959
audio engineer so you show me these

299
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:19,200
things I can tell you that they blink

300
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,420
and that they do things

301
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,700
massive props to the company that put

302
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,180
this up because I know there we go

303
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,740
um so you have ambient noise you have

304
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,180
loopback

305
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,380
hello Bjork on three

306
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,480
uh you have upstream and downstream

307
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,320
issues uh you know networking

308
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,000
and then you have recordings that can

309
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,620
magically disappear when your computer

310
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,000
catches fire allegedly

311
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:50,399
uh you can juggle dropouts because hey

312
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,680
no one likes an unscheduled break

313
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,800
uh so you need to edit the schedule or

314
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,660
if you're having fun

315
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,880
you can do a surprise QA so surprising

316
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,320
that someone is actually doing it from

317
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,000
their um

318
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,060
Garden drinking a mimosa best kind of QA

319
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,440
thanks to James Moore that was two years

320
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,579
ago

321
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:10,380
so yeah having friends available that

322
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,300
have a slide deck on hand and can do a

323
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,500
talk is fun

324
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,779
I learned that one the hard way uh

325
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:17,940
having guest speakers like hey you want

326
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,079
to do a surprise keynote thanks

327
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:23,579
you have two minutes

328
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:24,540
um

329
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,279
and you can also go behind the scenes of

330
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,860
scenes because hey

331
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,500
Colin sometimes die and no one knows why

332
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,079
or Community same move communities and

333
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,420
there's like a ton of stuff behind

334
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,360
it because well let's say staff are

335
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,880
umbrellas they try to Shield speakers

336
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,160
attendees and all that from a bunch of

337
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,000
stuff

338
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,720
uh imagine so we have a talk on uh

339
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,139
you know trickbot hey Joe

340
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:54,540
um imagine that we we got this uh this

341
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,180
team of uh how many people was it

342
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,100
yeah yeah 100 odd uh just starting

343
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,800
slagging everyone uh attacking twitch uh

344
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,740
you know all that

345
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,860
organizers are umbrellas in the

346
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,899
nicest possible ways they're not indeed

347
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:13,260
yeah uh you have people that are phobic

348
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,820
you have people that are racist uh

349
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,860
xenophobic etc etc the list goes on

350
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,440
something has actually caught fire

351
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,579
we don't want that uh yeah literally uh

352
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:25,139
we have incidents that needs to be

353
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:26,760
smoothed out because hey you can

354
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,860
actually offend people by talking

355
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,019
people need to know that

356
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,720
people are sometimes unaware

357
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,160
so yeah

358
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,500
a few other small things

359
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,680
uh broken laptop presentation format out

360
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,160
of whack uh Flock of Seagulls

361
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,380
uh no backups the copyright strike

362
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,500
moderation fails recording fails uh not

363
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,060
having the appropriate dongles for your

364
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,880
50 billion thing Ian isn't here but he

365
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,060
had a FireWire to HDMI adapter there you

366
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,200
go

367
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,600
mixed channels because if you know we

368
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,100
have a sound deck here it's terrible

369
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,260
it's very nice but also I'm not an audio

370
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,680
engineer Logistics can go badly uh I've

371
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,180
had to go to a bathroom today you

372
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,339
wouldn't assume but yeah that means that

373
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:14,279
someone needs to be here uh or a bad

374
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:16,620
Network please don't

375
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,079
this is this is what I meant with

376
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:21,720
ambient you see you're proving my point

377
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,019
there you go uh so for example I'm gonna

378
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:26,519
give you the perfect example of how to

379
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:28,320
be a very terrible speaker

380
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,839
I'm going to put aside to myself

381
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:33,779
at Defcon uh I had a computer

382
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:36,720
plugged it into American electricity and

383
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,680
you wouldn't guess how many American

384
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,120
things are bad for you

385
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,060
uh so my laptop decided to not work for

386
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:42,779
a while

387
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:45,660
and uh my car my talk wasn't backed up

388
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,480
in my demo either so I had to do an m.2

389
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,699
driver switchy with another computer

390
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:53,399
uh a corporate computer this comes in

391
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:55,260
five seconds later because when I plug

392
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,880
that in during the talk

393
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,899
guess what happened HDMI is disabled

394
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:02,220
fun

395
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,470
that was kind of fun

396
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,579
[Applause]

397
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:07,680
there you go that's kind of fun so what

398
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,540
did I do I got uh I got their uh their

399
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:13,440
old CTF scoreboard computer uh 2007 Dell

400
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,380
Inspirion running Windows 11.

401
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,880
so that took about two minutes to boot

402
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,600
and then uh shoved in my USB key which I

403
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,779
thankfully had the key to you know there

404
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:28,199
shove my USB key into it it turned off I

405
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:29,820
had to boot it back up you know find a

406
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,920
charger put it back in and then get my

407
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,480
presentation lost 20 minutes out of a

408
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,699
one hour slot also I didn't have a demo

409
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:39,000
anymore so there went to 20 minutes

410
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,180
so yeah now back to the third part

411
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,800
I

412
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,399
I mentioned I do stupid and fun things

413
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:49,740
let's let's get into this

414
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,079
uh so yeah when you're dealing with AV

415
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,540
at a conference you well there's not

416
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,240
that much space here on to my left

417
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,360
there yeah that's not gonna fix itself

418
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,000
um so you have uh you have an audio deck

419
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,220
you have uh it's not your fault it's my

420
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,120
fault

421
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,380
um you have an audio deck you have an

422
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,600
OBS station you have a bunch of stuff

423
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,540
so you can literally do this

424
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,100
by being one person

425
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,920
VOD editor that's uh everything from you

426
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,560
know the recordings uh Zoom uh with

427
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,380
camera and microphone into Twitter well

428
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,480
viewing twitch stats because hey you

429
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,399
need to viewing the chat moderating all

430
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,680
that stuff uh you zoom into this

431
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,720
computer which you're recording and

432
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,060
streaming to OBS which wouldn't you know

433
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,100
is what you're catching on Twitch

434
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,959
you can do this

435
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,699

436
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:40,920

437
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,019

uh so like I said obs

439

an audio thing

464
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:45,600
I am not an audio engineer I mentioned

465
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,520
this so basically the exact same setup

466
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,500
but more complicated the audio thing is

467
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,559
this

468
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:54,600
headsets handheld Zoom Graphics like

469
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,160

470
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,559

471
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:03,660
audio switching it had like five inputs

472
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,179
yeah

473
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:07,679
you'll learn by doing you'll learn by

474
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,360
doing the stream assets are fun to make

475
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,820
now uh you have this this is the beer

476

00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,360
in a few areas right

479
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,880
uh sponsors All That Jazz you know more

480
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,919
recursion we like recursion apparently

481
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:25,860
and we have the uh additional overlay so

482
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,140
that we can

483
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:30,480
unmess up slide overlay so we don't have

484
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,320
to be Pixel Perfect

485
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:36,539

what's a waveform it's a fun waveform

504
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,299
who would want to do an audio waveform

505
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:26,640
for every single piece of music that

506
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,200
you're going to be using as you're

507
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,340
between presenters music the break music

508
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,679
so my favorite thing to do is spending

509
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:36,900
time automating stuff that I could have

510
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,460
done by hand

511
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,160
and I try every single time to disprove

512
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,600
this statement

513
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,340
right never spend six minutes doing

514
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,720
something by hand if you can spend six

515
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,460
hours failing to automate it

516
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,980
I tried to disprove that I succeed

517
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,679
this crap uh I'm not asking you to read

518
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:55,500
this I'm just asking you to cringe at

519
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,799
this part which is ffmpeg input

520
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,720
that's one filter

521
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,600
why do I do this to myself I ask knowing

522
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,280
perfectly well that I'm slightly

523
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,320
masochistic

524
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,660
um this is for blender because hey of

525
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,039
course you do some video editing you

526
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,780
need some blendering to just shut things

527
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,820
on things the reason why you didn't do

528
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,559
it by hand for each and every one of

529
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,679
them because I had 25 of them

530
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,940
one thing maybe 25 things no

531
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,020
yeah

532
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,700
also spreadsheets

533
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,880
we are in infosec after all slightly I

534
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,280
mean most of us are and those of us that

535
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,840
aren't also used spreadsheets otherwear

536
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,360
you know or cyber SEC or software or

537
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,940
like huge spreadsheets right

538
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,280
so spreadsheets

539
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,840
spreadsheets

540
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,380
spreadsheets we love spreadsheets

541
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,440
no so yeah wouldn't be in for sacrified

542
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,299
spreadsheets

543
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:55,799
so I am dastardly early I I had less

544
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:58,039
than 47 slides it's very normal

545
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:00,720
I'm finishing after 20 minutes

546
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,360
so cons are fun for you fun for me that

547
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,160
so far so good I'm hoping you have a

548
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,640
good time with my in wacky

549
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,799
um they can also be very unfun

550
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,440
yeah it's it's a thing

551
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,840
uh so we both have to work as attendees

552
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,520
as volunteers as

553
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,179
hosting space as venue as Etc

554
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:24,059
to make it fun because otherwise we are

555
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:26,700
just fighting a losing battle

556
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,140
and also if you have more questions I'm

557
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,400

space because that's fun uh but nudge

594
