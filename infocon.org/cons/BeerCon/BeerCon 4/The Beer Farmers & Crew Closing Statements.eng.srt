10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,279
on Tuesday and saying all this was

11
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,320

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,240

14
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,120
um it's really important our community

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,040
is amazing I think we're really unique

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,880
in infosec and to watch people come do

17
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,620
their thing be given the confidence to

18
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,079
stand on this stage and speak and in the

19
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:44,340
hope that in years come I will see them

20
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,079
on the bigger stages and this has been

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,420
the kickoff point for it and I just want

22
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,219

the food bank which we took down earlier

35
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,380
a group of us walked all the way down

36
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,060
there which ended up being quite a long

37
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,580
walk because Nikki well the Uber wasn't

38

um what you're saying here is a an

86
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,019
output of a community the bear farmers

87
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:26,879
are not just the constituent members

88
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,159
myself Ian Lisa and Nikki it's everybody

89
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:30,599
else

90
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:31,620
um

91
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,000
and

92
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,140
particularly uh Nicos Jared and Dave

93
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,519
have been with us for quite a long time

94
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,260
and they've been incredibly instrumental

95
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,540
in US putting on these things uh we

96
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,860
wouldn't have been able to do all this

97
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,360
stuff without that kind of support and

98
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,280
we've got all the ideas and we bring in

99
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,900
the speakers and all that kind of stuff

100
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,760
I'll come up with those in a minute but

101
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,040
the engineering and the Goodwill and the

102
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,799
giving up of time is what it's all about

103
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:57,420
um and for that I'll personally be

104
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,000
eternally grateful for I'm incredibly

105
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,700

107
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,560
magnificent conference

108
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,819
um I hope people have come along and

109
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:11,700
enjoyed it that didn't necessarily think

110
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,739
they were coming along to be a con we're

111
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:16,199
doing lots of PR it but it's not this

112
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,699
conference itself The Wider conference

113
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:19,440
is not exclusively around cyber security

114
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,060
in infosec

115
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,260
um and hopefully there are people who've

116
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,820
learned some new things and met some new

117
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,940
people but they didn't expect to meet

118
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,080
um so thank you for that and again

119
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,240
thanks uh specifically to James mcgoff

120
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,639
for um taking a risk on bringing us into

121
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,199
this and from what I've seen in my

122
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:35,520
interactions and involvement in it it

123
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,800
seems like it's been a huge success

124
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,320
so I want to thank Donatos now Donatos

125
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,220
was the opening speaker yesterday

126
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,380
morning but for very different reasons

127
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,639
he wasn't able to come along but I want

128
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,960
to thank him anyway because he couldn't

129
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,479
he put in a presentation and we accepted

130
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,340
it unfortunately his circumstance has

131
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,540
changed and he couldn't come but I want

132
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,740
to call him out

133
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,500
um

134
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,820
well done for waking up about a winner

135
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,560
time zones are a bit of a tricky thing

136
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,620
at times or in fact Sam Phil Natasha

137
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,320

144
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,139
um realized you're new to this gig but

145
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:20,880
yeah you did an absolutely amazing

146
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,860
presentation on a really important topic

147
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,360
well done uh Dan Harry McLaren uh Dirk a

148

great talk Marta very well done indeed

149
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,259
Nikos a blinding insight into what goes

150
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:35,460
on behind the scenes in putting this

151
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,199
kind of thing on I think you only share

152
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,759
the things you could yeah I think you

153
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:39,840
made that clear at the beginning that

154
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,860
there are some things you just can't

155
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,539
talk about because nobody wants to see

156
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:45,620
all the blood on the carpet

157
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,840
and again I just want to thank the

158
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,340
people for coming along because we put

159
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,660
these things on for people to be

160
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,600
entertained and educated to engaging

161
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,060
community and make new friends

162
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,979
um and it's a pleasure for us to be

163
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:01,199
enrolled in that process and then

164
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,880
finally yeah I believe we've collected

165
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,259
quite a bit of food for the new and food

166
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:05,580
bank which was touched on just a minute

167
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,139
or so ago

168
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:08,580
um that's putting food in the mouths of

169
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,960
people that are underprivileged in a

170
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,479
disadvantage so we're really cool

171
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,100
uh it's a really cool thing that we've

172
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,479
done there we're really grateful to

173
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:17,580
people that brought stuff along and that

174
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,919
for me is the end unless any of my

175
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,060
friends and colleagues have got anything

176
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,580
else to add we'll call it a wrap

177
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,240
peace
