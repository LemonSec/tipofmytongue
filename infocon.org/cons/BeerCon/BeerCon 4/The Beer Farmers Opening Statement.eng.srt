00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:50,579
introduction which was obviously

20
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,379
completely factually correct at all

21
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:54,180
points and mine will also be similarly

22
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,620

25
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,899
a notorious influencer for Haribo she is

26
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:05,760
one of their key information security

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,340
influences despite the brand trying to

28
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,600
break into the information security

29
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,659
space somehow and she's also a party

30
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:15,420
animal and she also likes to confuse the

31
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,040
Sherpas with the Incas but that's

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,280
another story so this is Nikki welcome

33
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,900
thank you

34
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,180
and I know it's really true the Short

35

Straw here so I'm going to introduce the

36
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,140
fat hobbit uh me and the pet Hobbit are

37
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,880
renowned for getting in many amounts of

38
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,619
trouble primarily on boats and around

39
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,100
piracy uh we kind of bonded over our

40
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,140
mutual love of solarwinds

41
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,540
um and I'm sure that if our Hobbit we'll

42
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,979
talk about sailor Moon's Lots today and

43
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:42,180

birthday for Friday

59
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,819
what we gotta say right okay so brief

60
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:31,739
history of birkon so this is our fourth

61
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:33,120
beer con

62
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,819
um our first book on was back just

63
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:38,580
pre-pandemic in 2019 a fully virtual

64
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,400
conference where we had 89 presenters

65
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,920
across 26 and a half hours

66
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,040
um non-stop uh um interviews really and

67
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,120
it was all about raising money for

68
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,860
charity and it was a really fantastic

69
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,840
event we had lots of luminaries and lots

70
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,640
of people that were household names in

71
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,800
the industry uh and in the community but

72
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,180
also quite a lot of people that were

73
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,040
just doing great work but not so many

74
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,300
people had heard of and it was a real

75
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,519
success and then we did it again

76
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:04,440
um again it was a pandemic time and so

77
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,060
we were all locked down we couldn't go

78
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,620
anywhere so we ran the second virtual

79
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,599
conference in 2020 which was of course

80
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,239
beer con too and the premise of that was

81
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,040
purely around rookies so it was about

82
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,780
people that were new to public speaking

83
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,700
not necessarily new to the industry but

84
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,379
new to standing up in front of strangers

85
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:21,480
and and sharing their experiences and

86
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,580
again it was a great success

87
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,980
and then last year it was a little more

88
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,599
relaxed and we were able to go out and

89
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,640
meet up with a few people so we did Berk

90
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,440
on three which was set down in London at

91
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,300
Ian's old recording studio down in

92
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,980
southeast London

93
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,480
um and we had a bit of a mix so again it

94
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,920
was rookies

95
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,840
um but some people had spoken with us

96
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,239
before and other people was um besides

97
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,620
and it was great

98
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,840
and then around that time the good

99
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,280
people at DTX

100
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,959
um namely James mcgough came along and

101
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,459
said you know we really like what you

102
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,319
guys are doing you kind of you're in

103
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,580
with the community and you're mixing it

104
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,959
up a little bit and you've got kind of

105
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,879
punk thing going on which was nice to

106
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:57,599
hear

107
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,519
and we started a conversation really so

108
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:00,780
it was around about this time last year

109
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,959
about whether it would be a good format

110
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:07,500
to be able to bring the community vibe

111
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,239
that we try and establish and deliver

112
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:13,739
with their con into a larger event

113
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:16,500
like the place you're in today and so

114
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,000
we've done a lot of planning and

115
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,798
negotiating and chatting and working out

116
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:21,180
and designing and all that kind of stuff

117
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,740
and what you see around you is the kind

118
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,780
of the products for all of that work

119
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:28,740
so this is beer con four and again in

120
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,300
terms of the content it's a bit of a mix

121
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,620
of people have never done it before

122
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,139
people are

123
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:35,280
more established and experienced in

124
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,620
delivering talks and again we've got a

125
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,240
really great mix of topics we've got a

126
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,639
great mix of people you know when we put

127
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:44,280
out calls for presentations we just want

128
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,000
to know if you've got something

129
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,259
interesting that you want to share and

130
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:47,639
that's that's really the only thing

131
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,620
we're after and so you'll see that

132
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,020
across the next couple of days

133
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,259
um it would be remissing me not to pay

134
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:57,120
tribute to the the members of the bear

135
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,860
Farmers that have passed away from our

136
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,360
team not passed away but passed away

137
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,740
from the team

138
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,960
um over the last 12 months so I'd like

139
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,419
to give a big shout outs to

140
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:09,479
um to John optinaka uh to Sean Wright

141
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:12,180
and of course to Scott McGrady

142
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,400
um all those guys decided that life was

143
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,960
just getting a little bit too busy for

144
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,580
them you know to be able to include

145
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,979
working on these projects and we fully

146
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:21,540
respect that and they go with our love

147
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,039
and blessing and we still talk regularly

148
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,620
with them but again as as Ian just

149
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,479
started off within the opener we welcome

150
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:30,000
Lisa and Nikki and and it gives us some

151
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,039
fresh perspective some fresh energy and

152
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:33,360
we're doing some new stuff and a lot of

153
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,860
the things that are happening over these

154
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,380
next two days uh are purely a product of

155
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,300
the contributions that Lisa and Nikki

156
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,100
have already made into what we're doing

157
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,419
so

158
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:46,080
I want to give big thanks to DTX DTX ucx

159
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,340
irx

160
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,460
um for taking a pump on this project uh

161
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,860
a bit of a risk because this standard

162
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,600
format of Expo or large convention is

163
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,060
more geared up to vendor displays and

164
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,620
booths and people wanting to sell your

165
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,240
products and services well we're not

166
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,740
doing that we've never been about that

167
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,240
we're about connecting the community

168
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,400
with the industry because without the

169
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,500
community personally the industry is

170
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,180
nothing doesn't exist

171
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,940
I want to give a shout out to the crew

172
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,340
um and so on site we've got we've got

173
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,380
Dave McKenzie Dave McKenzie he's a nurse

174
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,759
while of every single thing the bear

175
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,380
Farmers have ever done

176
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,360
um his name is mentioned more in every

177
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,819
conversation we have than the word the

178
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:25,919
and he's probably laughing now because I

179
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,020
raised that one at the last day I come

180
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,300
big shout outs to Jared again who's been

181
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,979
with us for a long time helping out

182
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:33,660
doing a lot of the tech being really

183
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,039
super helpful in everything that we try

184
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,080
to put on and then last but not least

185
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,360
Nikos who's been the guy that rocks up

186
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,180
late last night with all of us kind of

187
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,860
our hair on fire about audio and video

188
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,780
not working properly and then fixed it

189
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,240
all so hopefully you're seeing the

190
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,620
output of the quality of the work that's

191
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,380
gone into preparation of this we've got

192
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,960
I think 20 speakers across the two days

193
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,520
we've

194
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,680
um got all sorts of good stuff going on

195
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,960
you're seen us waxing on about the the

196
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,819
food collection scheme for newham food

197
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:05,220
bank so if you haven't already and

198
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,660
you're going out and about you're coming

199
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,340
back tomorrow you know there's a local

200
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,800
Tesco in fact Tesco Amplified our tweet

201
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,960
yesterday which was super cool

202
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,880
um pick up some tin things and some

203
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,319
pasta and all that kind of stuff bring

204
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,419
it along we've got a box which I suspect

205
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:20,220
is probably not big enough really for

206
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,380
the amount of uh content that it's going

207
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,479
to get but just keep bringing stuff

208
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,160
along and we will make sure that it gets

209
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,380
passed over to the local food bank

210
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,840
um and we thank you for it for all that

211
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,280
stuff

212
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,340
um as you probably saw we had a

213
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,960
um a late cancellation in the schedule

214
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,120
so Donatos was unable to join us for

215
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,099
various personal reasons so we've got

216
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:43,740
Fleur coming up at 11 o'clock uh still

217
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,060
on track so we've got a few minutes

218
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,639
before that happens

219
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:50,340
um and that's kind of it for me I'll

220
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,740
shut the hell up so if Ian or Nikki or

221
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,479
Lisa you want to take over the mic for a

222
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,900
minute all right okay great opening

223
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,180
remarks Mike uh just a few housekeeping

224
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,520
things these headphones on the ground

225
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,800
right here if the conference noise

226
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,199
becomes too busy for you just pick them

227
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,240
up hold down the button till it turns

228
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,360
red and you should be able to hear

229
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,280
um a lot better if the conference noise

230
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,800
uh becomes too much for you

231
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,900
Nikki you have a point

232
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,240
if anybody in here does use these can I

233
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,379
just ask that when you take them off and

234
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:24,000
leave the big Garden you put them on

235
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,319
this table this table just so I can

236
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,879
sanitize them and put them back if

237
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,220
that's all right whatever right and just

238
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,259
a reminder too if you've got

239
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:32,760
um Goods that you want to donate to the

240
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,880
food bank just place them up here and uh

241
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,979
we'll be taking all of that stuff after

242
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:40,979
the two days of the conference all right

243
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,320
so uh Dave Mack

244
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,180
um just two minutes until our next

245
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,940
speaker comes to us um she will be

246
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,519
appearing uh remotely from an

247
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:53,160
undisclosed location mostly undisclosed

248
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,140
uh location because no one told me

249
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,660
exactly where any of the speakers are

250
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,760
located but from somewhere on planet

251
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,760
Earth We're fairly certain

252
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,860
any other things that we need to pass on

253
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,380
at this time all right um I will just do

254
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,060
the obligatory

255
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,980
um there are no fire drills planned

256
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,080
today however if you hear the fire alarm

257
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,019
please depart in an orderly manner all

258
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:18,060
right I think that's the safety brief uh

259
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,560
that we need to give

260
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,580
Dave

261
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,740
I'm out of material unless people want

262
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,200
to hear about my life

263
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,800
um okay well thank you Lisa and uh I was

264

268
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,820
