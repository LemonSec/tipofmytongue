1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,659
R-rated Ted talk so

2
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:05,580
I don't know anyway I'm going to be

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,980
talking about teledildonics

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,540
a term you've probably come across it

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,420
was coined by a guy called Ted Nelson

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,099
and you have all heard of him because he

7
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:15,900
also coined the phrase

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,340
hypertext

9
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,140
he's slightly better known for that than

10
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,160
this one but anyway what is

11
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,800
teledeleonics it's the the concept of

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,539
being able to have a remote virtual

13
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,880
experience either with somebody else or

14
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,279
by yourself and I think it also

15
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,960
underlines while we really really really

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,059
need regulation in the internet of

17
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:35,040
things it's a great example of some of

18
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,760
the problems we've got

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,280
how's that

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,719
is that good

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,739
so lots of different people use

22
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:49,020
smart adult toys you might be surprised

23
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,059
to know one of the most popular areas of

24
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,940
use is actually in the military

25
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,640
I gave a bit of this talk several years

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,739
ago and happened to be a room with a

27
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:00,420
several star general who came up to me

28
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,840
and says you know that most of our

29
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,180
military use those why well because it

30
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,619
allows you to maintain an intimate

31
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:10,920
relationship over a great distance so if

32
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,560
you're posted out to the water theater

33
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,020
of war you can still maintain a

34
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,939
relationship with your partner at home

35
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:19,979
so they're incredibly popular which also

36
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,080
means it's a major challenge for their

37
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,240
cyber security there are other uses so

38
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,920
some of you might be aware there are

39
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,860
online sex parties we see cam modeling a

40
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,840
very popular market and there are lots

41
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,280
of other reasons perfectly legitimate

42
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,920
reasons for people to want to use Smart

43
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,439
adult toys unfortunately there are all

44
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,820
sorts of problems with them not least

45
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,200
one of which is the challenge of

46
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,600
location data so that is one particular

47
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,720
toy disclosing the real time fine GPS

48
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,600
location of their users I'm going to

49
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,520
come back to this point so where does it

50
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,659
all start I have a box of grot over here

51
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:56,820
this was the very first device that ever

52
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,100
came onto my radar it was the very first

53
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,680
smart toy that adults were aware of from

54
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,899
a company called lovince

55
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:06,000
it offered lots of interesting

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,979
functionality so there was a mobile app

57
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:09,959
you could drive it with somebody else at

58
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:11,160
another end of the world had another

59
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,260
mobile app and another device they

60
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,599
actually had the other end which is

61
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,180
oh actually that bit's falling out this

62
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,700
bit and we won't go too much into that

63
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,260
um

64
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,300
unfortunately it had very limited

65
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,160
security it had a default bluetooth pin

66
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,379
of four zeros which meant if you were

67
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:29,940
nearby the device and they weren't

68
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,560
currently connected to it you could

69
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,480
connect to it and take control of it so

70
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,120
it kind of had vibrator hijack but why

71
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,280
who cares um there were some quite early

72
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,920
security vulnerabilities we found uh in

73
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,379
the Android app that used to drive it uh

74
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:45,180
you could take stills from your online

75
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,760
sessions and they would be stored as

76
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,860
temporary image files in slash SD card

77
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,480
and as you probably know that's one of

78
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,099
the few areas of the file structure

79
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:55,379
early on that you could access over USB

80
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:57,660
on an Android phone so a really pretty

81
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,879
nasty way of doing things other crazy

82
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:03,300
areas um this is the love into hush

83
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,640
it's a smart butt plug I think it was

84
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,160
the world's first smart butt plug uh it

85
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,319
was blee so it had no concept of pin at

86
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,260
all it just pairs it just connects to

87
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,760
any device in range that wants to

88
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,379
connect so

89
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:19,319
butt plug hijack was a real possibility

90
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,000
um well we also started looking at was

91
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,860
some of the FAQs we started looking at

92
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,519
the um the data transfer regulations we

93
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,019
started looking at what they claimed do

94
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:29,700
they claim that all the data they

95
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,019
exchanged whether it was the butt plug

96
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:34,560
the flashlight equivalents or the um the

97
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,760
vibrator

98
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,080
they claimed that everything was

99
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,099
encrypted

100
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:40,799
except that they also use Java chat and

101
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,420
that was in the plane that was great

102
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,519
didn't you just love that so we just

103
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:45,780
closed that to them

104
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,540
they took three weeks to acknowledge we

105
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,640
chased them they said that yeah we're

106
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,560
not gonna fix that like what because we

107
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,060
got another app

108
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,400
so why not retire the old vulnerable app

109
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,500
yeah but we don't want to

110
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,140
but it leaks data over the public

111
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,360
internet because you're using plain text

112
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,099
and they still refuse to replace it so

113
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:06,959
which pissed me off

114
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,280
um other work that the team we've been

115
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,200
working on so my lovely colleague uh

116
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,420
Andrew Tierney or cyber Gibbons spent

117
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,980
some time looking at the the firmware

118
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,139
but um in the meantime a research called

119
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:18,660
smilum did an amazing piece of research

120
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,120
and presented it at Defcon 27 showing

121
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,440
all sorts of problems with the firmware

122
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,479
how you could hijack it overheat the

123
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,280
battery whilst it's in your butt and

124
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,520
anyway we won't talk about that too much

125
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,259
other researchers have been looking at

126
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:33,840
these devices too so uh chappie uses

127
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,240
Twitter handle Alberta Segura noticed a

128
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,340
vulnerability in the Chrome plug-in so

129
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,380
when you're using on a desktop

130
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,479
when you're using the cam girl version

131
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,340
so people could pay to take control of

132
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,340
your adult toy they could actually drop

133
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,919
an email to them and take remote control

134
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,440
of their vibrator it was also quite

135
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,000
interesting because you only needed to

136
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,860
know that email address in order to

137
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,080
deliver an exploit to them and one of

138
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,639
the API requests actually could

139
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:02,639
enumerate their email address great so I

140
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,600
gave you everything you needed to

141
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,060
remotely hijack it there was also a bug

142
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,600
in the API excuse me

143
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,460
and something we found a bit more

144
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,479
recently

145
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,840
now you could do hijack depend on which

146
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,220
version of the app you used but there

147
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,199
was a really quite nasty

148
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,139
bug that we found is that the phone that

149
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:25,020
you use to drive it continually made

150
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,139
outbound requests to a server on the

151
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:30,360
internet and that server was owned by

152
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,880
lavense so if you've been using your

153
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,060
personal phone to drive the vibrator and

154
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,220
you then took it to work and connected

155
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,039
to guest Wi-Fi if your it Department

156
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,780
were looking at outbound requests or

157
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,400
doing any sort of filtering they'd

158
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,199
instantly see that you were working in

159
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,479
the night as a cam model and I found

160
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,520
that quite distasteful really so just

161
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,419
because the vendor of the app had gave

162
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:55,919
no thoughts

163
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,199
so when and why they're making requests

164
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:59,880
on the internet they could effectively

165
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,280
unmask you and there have been numerous

166
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,900
people who have been unmasked in many

167
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,360
other ways as working

168
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,300
in second careers in the online porn

169
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,759
industry have been unmasked and fired by

170
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,020
their employers

171
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,340
I don't agree with that but that's

172
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,880
another story

173
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,039
other areas so um chaps

174
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:22,800
uh this is the kiru Onyx

175
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,160
rather wonderful piece of kits

176
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,319
it also had very similar issues I had a

177
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,199
bluetooth pin of one two three four you

178
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,880
couldn't change it so if it was usable

179
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,500
someone else could take control of it

180
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,479
and if you wanted someone else to join

181
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,160
you gave them a static link that never

182
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,560
expired so it was that was exposed for

183
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,419
any reason they'd have remote access to

184
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:44,940
your session another device this was

185
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,580
quite quirky very small exactly the same

186
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,500
problem with Bluetooth it had no pairing

187
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,180
pin

188
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,639
I now want to introduce a term that made

189
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:55,020
me chuckle when one of my amazing

190
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,460
colleagues guy called Alex Lomas

191
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:00,360
introduced it to me he had been out with

192
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,280
a mobile phone

193
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,780
looking

194
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:07,259
for Bluetooth IDs of adult toys and he'd

195
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:09,000
been out there doing it in Berlin of all

196
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,280
places and came back a bit shocked to

197
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,979
say well what I discovered was that I

198
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:15,780
could use Bluetooth tools like light

199
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,300
blue on an Android phone to go and

200
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,380
discover

201
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,139
Bluetooth IDs and you could figure out

202
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:25,440
who around you was either wearing or

203
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,280
using or owned a toy now obviously in

204
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,020
war driving over Wi-Fi we call that war

205
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,639
driving and we decided this was best

206
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,979
called screwdriving hunting for adult

207
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:36,720
toys over Bluetooth

208
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,940
now in order to do that you need to know

209
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,319
about the Bluetooth advertising names

210
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,880
and that's a real problem because all

211
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,979
Bluetooth devices when they're on will

212
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:45,900
advertise their Bluetooth ID that's what

213
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,880
Bluetooth does so all you need to know

214
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,620
to go screwdriving is know the various

215
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,560
advertising IDs of the various toys and

216
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,180
you can go and find out who's using what

217
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,880
now we talk about screwdriving going out

218
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,500
in towns and cities but actually I think

219
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,960
this is much more worrying in a context

220
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,280
of being at home

221
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,160
because Bluetooth range 20 meters 30

222
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,319
meters Raby which means if you live in a

223
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,699
block of flats and you see one of these

224
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:10,680
Bluetooth IDs you know the next door

225
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,380
flat owner is using an adult toy maybe

226
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,060
they're not bothered about that maybe

227
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,319
they are bothered about the fact that

228
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,300
you know just by being in proximity to

229
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,819
them that they've got an adult toy where

230
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:22,500
of course there's the teenager in the

231
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,419
house going oh mum and dad have got

232
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:26,639
adult toys difficult conversation that

233
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,440
one isn't it just because of Bluetooth

234
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
advertising IDs and of course the one

235
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,940
that you'll really want to know is that

236
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,099
one because that is the lavense hash

237
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:37,500
butt plug and this is in fact actually

238
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,679
Andrew T tweeted about this yesterday we

239
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,479
just we dismantled this one besides

240
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,459
Scotland in in Glasgow a good few years

241
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:46,920
ago got the motor wired up to a variable

242
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,360
power supply then drove it to the point

243
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,640
of explosion that was fun it doesn't

244
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,060
work anymore

245
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:55,800
there have been actions carried out one

246
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,899
the most famous by Miles was against a

247
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:00,000
company called We Vibe uh there was some

248
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,620
research done by a couple of researchers

249
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,300
which is really cool and they discovered

250
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,339
that we Vibe apps were collecting more

251
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:07,260
data about you

252
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,480
than their um FAQ in terms of use

253
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,860
suggested

254
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,360
they were collecting things like your

255
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,399
email address user location but it

256
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,300
exclusive also your behavior now I'm

257
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,860
sure what they meant to be collecting

258
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,959
was how people use these devices for

259
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:24,420
product Improvement but unfortunately

260
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,620
that didn't really seem to go that way

261
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,240
they collected a lot more than they said

262
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,399
they did they were then subject to a

263
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:30,839
class action suit and they settled for

264
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:32,880
3.7 million dollars

265
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,060
but they are still leaking location data

266
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,399
so despite being sued despite being

267
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,680
fined they're still leaking data in some

268
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,779
cases and then I want to go to an area

269
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:44,040
that I find

270
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,140
really unpleasant now

271
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,580
we've talked about Bluetooth we've

272
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,800
talked about someone knowing do you have

273
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,019
a tool we've also started to see certain

274
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:54,000
toys and this is some work we did a good

275
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,720
few years ago this is quite an

276
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,660
intriguing device this is uh the smack

277
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:05,160
on see me and it is a vibrator endoscope

278
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,560
which I just find mind-blowing why

279
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,300
someone want to do this but do you know

280
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,540
what it's fine if people want to do

281
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,680
these things

282
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,480
that's fine why should people not be

283
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,160
able to use these toys in the privacy of

284
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,300
their own home if that's what they want

285
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,220
to do we should be able to rely on these

286
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,660
manufacturers doing it safely and

287
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,899
securely so anyway this is done news I

288
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:26,519
didn't use Bluetooth it used Wi-Fi and

289
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:28,140
those of you who've got Wi-Fi open on

290
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,580
your smartphones

291
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,800
you can connect to it it's if you should

292
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,700
so wish the SSID is uh see me

293
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,200
um which means you can of course you can

294
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,339
wiggle for it so you can find users on

295
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:43,200
the wireless War driving database so you

296
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,760
can find where people are

297
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,279
the pre-share key is static and

298
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,620
unchangeable it's 8 8.

299
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,180
which means you can connect to it so

300
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,459
feel free to connect to my

301
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:55,500
vibrator endoscope

302
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,180
the team started doing some work and

303
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,620
started reverse engineering the Android

304
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,600
version of the application we were quite

305
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,240
construct concerned to see things like

306
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,220
propeller controls referred to in the

307
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,959
code we went a bit further and realized

308
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,040
what had actually happened this is

309
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,800
effectively a camera and they'd actually

310
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,519
reused the code from a camera drone

311
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:16,800
because it was cheaper Easy to reuse

312
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,000
which is why there was all sorts of

313
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,700
interesting controls in there and that

314
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,980
blew my mind we actually approached the

315
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,899
the team behind Sky Viper and said did

316
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:26,339
you know that your code is in a drone

317
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:29,000
sorry dildo and they were like what

318
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,260
by some amazing um for instance

319
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,940
coincidence I don't think they owned the

320
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,380
cut the version of code from that

321
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,480
version of the Drone later versions of

322
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,700
the sky Viper they do own the code but

323
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,899
they were quite shocked when we told

324
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,160
them about this

325
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,800
so go into the code a bit more and

326
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,779
discover that the embedded web server

327
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:46,980
which you can all connect to if you want

328
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,260
to see me eight eight connect to it open

329
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,380
it in a browser IP address

330
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,720
192.1681.1 on Port 80 fail there is an

331
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,579
embedded web server there's a username

332
00:11:56,579 --> 00:11:58,740
of admin the capacitor is blank

333
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,440
which gives you access to

334
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,440
this so if you want to

335
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,240
you can connect

336
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,880
to the adult toy it supports multiple

337
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,680
concurrent connections

338
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,160
so if you're in Wi-Fi range anyone else

339
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,560
can connect to the camera

340
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,899
whilst you're using it and there's no

341
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:20,820
evidence to suggest that anyone else is

342
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,800
connected so just turning this damn

343
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,720
thing on and using it exposes you to

344
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,120
some theft of some very personal data

345
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,360
that's some RJ45 cable but yeah let's

346
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,459
not think about that anymore

347
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:34,740
but that was just too damned easy what I

348
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,180
really wanted was a persistent root

349
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,920
shell on a dildo

350
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,500
and uh the wonderful team um Andrew and

351
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,139
Alex did some great work the first thing

352
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:44,880
they discovered is that because it was

353
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,639
set effectively a drone camera you could

354
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:48,959
actually set it up it looked like it

355
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,940
used some CCTV camera some security

356
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,820
camera code so you could actually set up

357
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,459
um auto trigger so if it's laptop left

358
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:57,839
on and anything moved it would also

359
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,279
record and stream that data for you

360
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,360
which was great

361
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,519
uh the team went further they looked at

362
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:04,920
the Wi-Fi Max one of the things that had

363
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,500
real potential because it was a CCTV

364
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,240
camera we were wondering about whether

365
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,980
there was potential to use the Mirai

366
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,940
exploit code remember from like 2016

367
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,040
so we tried that it looked very like the

368
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,420
mirror exploit was going to work but it

369
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,500
didn't

370
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,639
um it didn't actually work on the root

371
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:21,899
creds

372
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:23,579
so Andrew actually stripped it right

373
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:25,620
back got the firmware off it didn't take

374
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,079
too long found injection points managed

375
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,420
to get into the firmware but could not

376
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:34,200
get the root credentials

377
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,600
so we were trying to work out how to

378
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,459
brute force them and couldn't we got

379
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:39,779
about lucky there so actually because

380
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:41,940
because the web app ran his root and we

381
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,920
had exploits in the web app we could

382
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,260
then write ourselves a new user into Etc

383
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,240
password and then we had root and of

384
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,459
course what that then meant we could

385
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:52,920
then grep all the root creds and

386
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,380
discovered ah it was actually a recam

387
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,820
camera and if we'd known that we

388
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,839
probably could have worked out what the

389
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,700
root creds were this way

390
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,920
so we've got roots and there's the

391
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,839
exploit code if you want it we are

392
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,399
tracking you if you go there

393
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:07,079
but it works

394
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:09,420
so we've got a persistent root cell

395
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:13,440
on a camera enabled vibrator endoscope

396
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,120
never thought I'd put those two words in

397
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,860
a sentence together vibrator and

398
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,200
endoscope anyway

399
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,360
other crazy things so

400
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,000
Alex my colleague and also Alan started

401
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,220
doing some work looking at hookup apps

402
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,540
it's another area that I think is quite

403
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,620
concerning

404
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,760
they looked at a number of different

405
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,200
apps that are used for certain

406
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,660
communities to get together to meet each

407
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,240
other looked at a number

408
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,620
one of the things that's most

409
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,199
interesting is about these apps is

410
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:42,240
hooking up you need to know look for

411
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,279
people that are in the same area as you

412
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:47,940
and many of these you would use GPS

413
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,860
and you could then say this user is X

414
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,199
meters or kilometers away from you

415
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:53,519
but what you could do is you could then

416
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,699
spoof your position using the app and

417
00:14:56,699 --> 00:14:59,060
then use what's called trilateration so

418
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,839
triangulation is on a flat plane

419
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:03,300
trilateration is around a globe a curved

420
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,160
surface but

421
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,040
passing different distances to the API

422
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,959
you could trilaterate and get a very

423
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:13,860
precise location for the user so just by

424
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,019
publishing how far away you were you

425
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:17,459
could work out exactly where somebody

426
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,920
was uh there are all sorts of issues

427
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,139
people have been targeting people with

428
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:24,660
certain sexual preferences online and

429
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,639
they've been targeting them stalking

430
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:27,600
them

431
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,940
getting very precise location and going

432
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,920
causing harm to people

433
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,560
this concept of precise GPS location

434
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,079
League also worries me intensely in

435
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:38,699
applications that are geared up towards

436
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:40,440
certain um for example the gay community

437
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,320
the lesbian community in regions where

438
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,500
it's illegal to be homosexual I strongly

439
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,060
disagree with that I might add but

440
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,100
unfortunately certain regions do not

441
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,380
permit homosexuality and there we have

442
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:56,100
hookup apps wantonly disclosing precise

443
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,579
location of gay lesbian homosexual

444
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:01,199
people and I find that really really

445
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,899
worrying uh there's also cases proven

446
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:05,820
cases in Egypt

447
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,860
where people with certain preferences

448
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,139
have been targeted by the police

449
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:12,240
I find this really worrying that certain

450
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,160
applications will play fast and loose

451
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,860
with our personal data

452
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,899
we disclose these of course one to three

453
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:20,760
fun which is a threesomes hookup app

454
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,040
rather wonderfully we discovered at the

455
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,260
same time people trying to hook up

456
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,760
in the White House

457
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,220
and also the houses of Parliament wow

458
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,740
that special relationship hey across the

459
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,820
pond

460
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,980
uh disclosing to three from was a

461
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,560
dumpster fire uh you could recover

462
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,899
precise Latin long you didn't even need

463
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:41,339
to try later you got their birthday

464
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:43,500
private photographs and probably the

465
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,600
most suitable photograph for work we

466
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,759
could find was this one so people's

467
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,040
personal photographs in a variety of

468
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,079
very compromising poses have been

469
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,399
exposed on the public internet for

470
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:55,500
anyone to access that's terrible

471
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,959
uh what they suggested was doing a snap

472
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:00,240
to grid so rather than giving precise

473
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,160
location you give you'd snap someone to

474
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,140
grid and let's say a kilometer grid okay

475
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,819
fair it means you lose that Precision

476
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:09,959
Apple have also made big progress by not

477
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:11,579
allowing certain apps to have precise

478
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:13,500
location data that's progress good on

479
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,380
you but finally to wrap it up I want to

480
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,540
introduce

481
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:21,000
the smart [ __ ] lock some of you might

482
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,760
remember this this was an utter [ __ ]

483
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,619
show uh

484
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:29,700
this is a chastity cage for men the idea

485
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,380
is that you clamp this hardened steel

486
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,480
thing behind your neckers

487
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,220
put this on the front and you're then

488
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,700
locked in

489
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:40,260
it then connects to a smartphone app

490
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,179
which allows you to lock the user in but

491
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:44,940
what's interesting is certain

492
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,039
communities and I have no issue with

493
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,179
this people should be able to do what

494
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:50,220
they want to do privately safely and

495
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,200
securely but certain communities then

496
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,000
allow you to digitally give the unlock

497
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,880
key to a third party hence the concept

498
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,059
of Chastity so someone else has control

499
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:02,460
over your penis

500
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,600
great

501
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,100
that's fine if people want to do that

502
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,020
that's cool

503
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,940
unfortunately some of the team were

504
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,200
looking at this and whereas there are a

505
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,960
number of flaws so when you invite

506
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,640
someone to use the app you're given I

507
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,039
kid you not a member code

508
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,559
yeah how unfortunate and unfortunately

509
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:21,179
through a bunch of vulnerabilities in

510
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:22,679
the API

511
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:24,360
we realized that actually you could

512
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,580
remove the ability of the user and the

513
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,260
third party to unlock themselves so you

514
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,020
could actually lock someone in

515
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:33,539
permanently and the only way to get out

516
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:36,299
was either to cut the hardened steel

517
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:39,000
shackle which given where it's going to

518
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,740
be is I wouldn't want to put an angle

519
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,780
grinder down there anyway but you could

520
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,240
also actually destroy the device by

521
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,460
Levering off the front cage so if you

522
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,720
were locked in you could get yourself

523
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,360
out after a fashion but there was also

524
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,100
the fact that it disclosed fine GPS

525
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,740
coordinates of the wearer and also

526
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,360
disclosing for the manufacturer was a

527
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,740
nightmare they just weren't interested

528
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,000
they claimed they had no money and

529
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,620
therefore it wasn't their problem but

530
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,240
yet all the time they were working on

531
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,760
version two of the smart penis cage

532
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,860
which had all the same functionality as

533
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,260
before but only if you can see right in

534
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,880
the middle there are a pair of

535
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,039
electrodes you could also remotely shock

536
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:16,799
the wearer so they were more interested

537
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,840
in developing the latest product which

538
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,340
they could shock someone with remotely

539
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,080
than actually fixing their cyber

540
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,299
security problem they have kind of fixed

541
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:26,460
the bugs now several years later but I'm

542
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,100
still very very disappointed that it had

543
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,020
to get to that point they just weren't

544
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,340
talking to us we ended up having to

545
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,960
involve the press to get anything

546
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,179
sensible and meaningful out of them

547
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:38,520
the serious side of things

548
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,580
um

549
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,600
porn

550
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,280
is Big Business

551
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,919
porn was the reason we used Blu-ray not

552
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:50,340
high def DVD right pornography has a lot

553
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,660
of influence

554
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,059
these toys are everywhere just some

555
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,799
screwdriving you'll see that they've

556
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:58,020
increased hugely in popularity

557
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,179
particularly during a lockdown when

558
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:03,179
people wanted to be able to meet up and

559
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:04,500
have intimate sessions with each other

560
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,780
but weren't able because of lockdown to

561
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,280
be with each other so the sales of sex

562
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,620
toys went nuts

563
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,480
during the lockdown

564
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,940
we often laugh when we talk about these

565
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,640
products and we laugh because we're

566
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,620
probably a bit uncomfortable you know we

567
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,960
don't realize these devices exist so we

568
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,960
laugh we feel confused uncomfortable

569
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,400
surprised that perhaps these things

570
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,539
exist

571
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:28,919
I'll be honest I was a bit surprised

572
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:30,480
when I first discovered that a smart

573
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,760
connected dildo existed

574
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,380
and we also laugh I think because we're

575
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,580
surprised the Cyber Security

576
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,160
Professionals that these problems still

577
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,320
exist that will largely solved five ten

578
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,360
years ago in the mainstream world of

579
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,660
cyber security but there is hope for us

580
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,000
those words come from a really cool

581
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,580
researcher uh called who goes by the

582
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,200
handle the internet of dongs

583
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,840
uh Brad render very good guy and he does

584
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,299
a lot of independent research exposing

585
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:59,760
cyber security vulnerabilities but also

586
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,460
helping some of the manufacturers learn

587
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,919
and get their [ __ ] in order so that

588
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:07,080
when we buy these products We've Got

589
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,640
Confidence that our data isn't being

590
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,380
splattered over the Internet for hackers

591
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,740
to see or our fine GPS position is being

592
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,020
exposed it's actually a really easy

593
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,299
space to get into you can go and buy

594
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:21,120
these toys off Amazon I assure you you

595
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,679
will get some very weird recommendations

596
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:25,380
shortly afterwards my buying habits are

597
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,120
totally screwed because of some of the

598
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,860
weird stuff that I buy smart kids

599
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,080
talking dollies smart dildos you get

600
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,940
some really weird things but go have

601
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,000
some fun go and buy some devices go

602
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,400
explore go learn about API and Hardware

603
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,559
security they're a great environment to

604
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,320
play with and also do some weird things

605
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,260
I hope you found this a little bit

606
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:48,659
alarming a bit of a wake-up call the

607
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:49,980
fact that we need to be doing cyber

608
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,600
security in this space much much better

609
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,640
there's lots more on the blog I promise

610
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,020
you nearly everything on the blog is

611
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,460
suitable for work

612
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,320
perhaps not everything but go over read

613
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,940
there's loads of great advice on there

614
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:03,740
thanks so much I hope you enjoyed it

615
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,840
okay so is there any questions for Ken

616
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,059
before we go

617
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:14,940
I actually have one for you

618
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,580
um my question is that a lot of the

619
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,740
things that you talked about then were

620
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,860
relating to adding geolocation

621
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:24,260
facilities to these devices

622
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,179
what's the rationale behind that from a

623
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,220
business case is it data harvesting to

624
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,280
sell on to another supplier or I mean is

625
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,260
there a legitimate use case for adding

626
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,600
this given the amount of vulnerability

627
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,020
that it then exposes you to yeah so

628
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,460
there's lots of answered that question

629
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,799
the first one is I think so with Android

630
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:45,240
when you enable Bluetooth course

631
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,860
location it actually enables sorry we

632
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,080
enable Bluetooth it enables course

633
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,760
location anyway

634
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,140
um this just was one of the features of

635
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,340
Android I'm not sure if it's still the

636
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,240
same

637
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,980
I think in many cases it was it's just

638
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,799
not realizing so organizations were

639
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,600
rushing to Market to do a connected cool

640
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,700
thing and not realizing that people's

641
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,580
data had importance I think there's also

642
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:08,760
wanting to get user data so where are

643
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,500
their big markets in the various

644
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,179
continents around the world where are

645
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:14,400
their products popular and then I think

646
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,419
there's some of it which is purely

647
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:17,039
functional as in if you want to hook up

648
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,900
I want to know where you are or I might

649
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,220
want to know where you are so I'm going

650
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,500
to need your location data so lots of

651
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,240
reasons some of them accidental some of

652
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,640
them intentional but certainly not a lot

653
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,919
of forethoughts about the security and

654
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:30,900
importance of that data

655
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,059
anyone else have any questions

656
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:34,799
anything at all

657
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,900
okay I have one more then

658
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,780
um as I'm prioritizing my own questions

659
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,000
um so you talked about how some of these

660
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,679
apps have

661
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,539
um sort of an ability I suppose to be

662
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:49,679
used by uh authoritarian governments to

663
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,360
track people down is there any evidence

664
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,039
of that actually happening from a human

665
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,020
rights perspective and what has that

666
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,159
actually

667
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,559
meant do you think the government in

668
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,120
some way allow the sale of these things

669
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,280
into their into their into their

670
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,360
countries because they have a lot of

671
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,880
control over what happens right

672
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,620
um as a way of maybe keeping tabs on

673
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,940
these individuals

674
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,400
so it absolutely has happened is I'm

675
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,679
aware of instance in Egypt

676
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,299
where

677
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:17,940
um gay hookup apps were explicitly

678
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,740
targeted by the police

679
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,120
um now I don't think they're using the

680
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,260
trilateration issue what they're

681
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,760
actually doing was creating fake

682
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,039
accounts in order to encourage a hookup

683
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:27,240
but they were using the fact that people

684
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,340
were in certain towns and cities to know

685
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,159
where to go first so it has happened

686
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,799
um there have been people are harmed in

687
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,140
similar cases so I think the importance

688
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,000
of this position is is hard to

689
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,640
understate people have been beaten up I

690
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,780
think there have been murders as well

691
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,760
which is really really sad

692
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,640
yeah and it's it's kind of interfering

693
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,380
with human rights in a sense and

694
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:52,260
enabling them to sort of go further

695
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,000
um thank you so much I really appreciate

696
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,559
you coming on I knew it was going to

697
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:57,360
take a dark turn because it always does

698
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,520
ever since the kettle presentation it's

699
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,740
just gone downhill from there but thank

700
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,000
you so much I appreciate it was

701
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,559
eye-opening

702
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,000
um yeah thanks
