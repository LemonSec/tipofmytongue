1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:02,580
so hi my name is Jenny and I'm going to

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,019
be talking to you about Scar the system

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,200
security so

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,660
I'd like to pre-face this by saying that

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,460
since I signed up for the talk A lot's

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,860
happened some good news it's resulted in

7
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,199
me changing my jobs and obtaining

8
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,000
funding ready for my PhD which I'm going

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,039
to start in January so it means I've

10
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:21,660
been spending more time getting my

11
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,820
proposal ready than preparing for this

12
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,060
talk so my apologies I will be reading

13
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,580
um but I hope you enjoy it and you know

14
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,140
I prefer to

15
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,079
do my best and cancel so thank you for

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,200
coming

17
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,320
so let's start by rewinding back six

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,840
years to the end of my second year of my

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,540
information security bachelor's degree

20
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,460
so quick shout out you don't need a

21
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,200
formal education to work in Tech that

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,879
was my route but it's not the only one

23
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,500
and I'm a massive advocate of that

24
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,840
anyway I was weighing at my options for

25
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,360
my dissertation the two areas of cyber

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,860
security that had especially piqued my

27
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,579
interest due to two pieces of literature

28
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:04,799
um where Scottish security and mass

29
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,320
surveillance so the literature were was

30
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,180
a book called data and Goliath which I

31
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,400
imagine some people have read and a

32
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,260
Chatham housed report on cyber security

33
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,400
at civil nuclear facilities so I was

34
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,200
aware of mass surveillance and I'm sure

35
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,060
everyone here knows who Edward Snowden

36
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,119
is but I wasn't aware of just how much

37
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,159
was happening and as a 20 year old

38
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,740
reading this book it was eye-opening

39
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,840
to this day I don't believe I've shared

40
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,000
my opinion on mass surveillance starting

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,860
from a class conversation in first year

42
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,840
when I was picked on by a lecturer to

43
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,479
answer the question Edward Snowden hero

44
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,640
or traitor and my answer was I don't

45
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,740
know but it's hot so I didn't have

46
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,240
enough information to answer the

47
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,579
question and now I see I answered like a

48
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:50,880
true politician such a complex area and

49
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,439
it's almost dangerous to share our

50
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:53,880
opinion on it without a thorough

51
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,060
explanation especially as it's easy to

52
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,159
see it for both sides or it is for me

53
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,140
this talk isn't on my surveillance as

54
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,600
you can tell so I didn't go down that

55
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,579
route but the Chatham House report was

56
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:08,719
just as shocking to me

57
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,739
um but in a completely different way I

58
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:12,420
wasn't aware of the technical issues

59
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,400
faced by sagada systems security

60
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,580
engineers and in this report

61
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,800
um this report was my induction into

62
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,440
what exactly a scada system was

63
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,180
it explained that these nuclear

64
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,000
facilities are or should be air-gapped

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,860
which means they're not connected to the

66
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,080
internet and that updating them is

67
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,360
really difficult as downtime as needed

68
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,360
which for like an electricity grid can

69
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,920
be difficult because you have to take

70
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,959
the electricity offline

71
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:40,620
um

72
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,040
so this had alarm bells ringing for me

73
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,500
um and I was thinking what if there's a

74
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,760
vulnerability that needs to be patched

75
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,920
how can it be secured

76
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,959
so obviously they should be air gaps so

77
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:53,459
this shouldn't matter but that isn't

78
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:55,500
always the case so these interests led

79
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,140
to two options the ethics of mass

80
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,959
surveillance by nation states and the

81
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,940
security risks associated with guard

82
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,560
systems

83
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,900
the first option would be a literature

84
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,760
review

85
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,860
and would be difficult for several

86
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,860
reasons firstly to get ethical approval

87
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,319
it would need to be thorough and look at

88
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,480
both sides and include research of how

89
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,659
the surveillance impacts people this in

90
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,040
turn would make the evaluation phase

91
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,680
very difficult not only that it would

92
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,120
have to come across as completely

93
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,800
unbiased

94
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,760
so the second option scada systems was

95
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,000
Technical and tangible I could look into

96
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,220
how known attacks have happened and look

97
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,680
at creating something to reduce the risk

98
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,459
of those attacks happening I could then

99
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,260
get the product created evaluated for

100
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,480
Effectiveness and I've got a solid idea

101
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,099
for dissertation

102
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:52,440
so as you can imagine I went for the

103
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,299
dissertation looking at security risks

104
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:56,760
associated with scada systems The Next

105
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,319
Step was to figure out what I'd be

106
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,659
creating so prior to writing up my

107
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:01,920
dissertation

108
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,560
I did some sorry prior to writing out my

109
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,599
distinction proposal I did some research

110
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,519
by now I was in the beginning of my

111
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:10,319
third year so I needed to get my idea

112
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,260
submitted and accepted soon

113
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,540
so the initial research showed that a

114
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,519
lot of attacks on scada systems were

115
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,680
successful due to human error so I

116
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,019
decided to focus on the human factor of

117
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:23,460
cyber security

118
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,500
the first step to resolving this would

119
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,960
be to put measures in place to educate

120
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,240
those with access to the systems and

121
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,160
restrict unauthorized access to the

122
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,160
strict to the systems I decided on a

123
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,900
compliance-based topic where I would

124
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,040
create an information security

125
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,020
management system for use with scada

126
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,120
systems

127
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,020
the dissertation would have two halves

128
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,780
firstly a literature review of articles

129
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,180
about current known attacks this would

130
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,660
include a brief a brief introduction to

131
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,600
scada systems and the dissertation had

132
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,060
to be written with no assumed knowledge

133
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,040
on the part of the reader

134
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,320
a detailed review of several scada

135
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,419
system attacks and a write-up of my

136
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:08,160
primary research where I interviewed

137
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,440
scada Engineers over the phone

138
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,800
the second and the second half would be

139
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,320
documentation of the process I underwent

140
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,320
to create the policy document

141
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,720
referencing the actual document

142
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,000
um in the appendices this included

143
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,160
analyzing a large number of existing

144
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,560
policy documents focusing heavily on the

145
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,500
iso 27000 series I looked at policy

146
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,000
layout content and writing style

147
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,860
so for those in the audience who don't

148
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,660
know what a scada system is this is for

149
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,860
you

150
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,440
scada stands for supervisory control and

151
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,080
data acquisition system and the best

152
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,780
example I have is a thermostat linked to

153
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,600
central heating you set it at 23 degrees

154
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,660
C it takes in data and makes changes

155
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,940
accordingly if the temperature is 20

156
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,280
degrees C which is below 23 degrees C

157
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,380
the heating will be on

158
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,600
well if the temperature is 25 degrees C

159
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,660
the heating will be off if the heating

160
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,720
if the heat rises from 20 to 23 degrees

161
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,080
C the heating will click off while if it

162
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,120
falls below 23 degrees C it will come

163
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,340
back on again

164
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,259
here's where industrial Control Systems

165
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:20,580
especially critical National

166
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,220
infrastructure comes in a nuclear

167
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,020
reactor's temperature is regulated this

168
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,180
way using control rods

169
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,759
sorry using control rods that control

170
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,580
the rates of fission a nuclear reactor

171
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,680
works by heating water using the heat

172
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,440
productive produced by the reactant

173
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,780
nuclear materials the water evaporates

174
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,360
into steam and turns into turbines

175
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,340
creating electricity

176
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,880
the nuclear reaction has safe levels and

177
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,380
the data acquisition of the temperature

178
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,780
and the correct use of the control rods

179
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:55,319
is imperative just look at Chernobyl

180
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,240
there may be some human intervention

181
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,580
here I'm not 100 sure of how it happens

182
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,740
especially now

183
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,319
um but when the reaction gets too hot

184
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:05,819
more controllers are added and it's

185
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:08,580
cooled down so incorrect data or

186
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,199
malfunction control rods could be

187
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,639
catastrophic

188
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,560
so for security reasons critical

189
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,600
National infrastructure should be aired

190
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,340
gapped which means that they should have

191
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,380
no connection to outside networks

192
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,780
especially the internet but the original

193
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,180
scada systems were monolithic not

194
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,580
because of security but because of when

195
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,220
they were built

196
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,840
monolithic scada systems are made up of

197
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,699
scada Master connected directly to

198
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:34,979
remote terminal units they're completely

199
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:38,639
air-gapped from here scada systems grew

200
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,979
up sorry from here Scar the systems grew

201
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:42,120
a technology

202
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,759
with distributed scada systems using a

203
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:48,060
local area network and a networked scada

204
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,580
system using a wide area network such as

205
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,280
the internet so I won't insult the older

206
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,319
people in the audience by explaining

207
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:57,479
these but if any of the younger members

208
00:07:57,479 --> 00:07:59,460
want me to talk about it catch me

209
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,199
afterwards

210
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,180
finally we get to the internet of things

211
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,220
which is relatively new

212
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,979
and we go back to the thermostat because

213
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:09,900
thermostats which used to be a

214
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,300
monolithic starter system are now part

215
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,919
of the internet of things as you can

216
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,960
control them from your from anywhere

217
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,960
using Technologies such as hive

218
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,180
while someone hacking into and messing

219
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,160
with your thermostat could be a pain in

220
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,479
the ass and cost you a lot of energy

221
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,759
bills especially at the moment it's

222
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,199
nothing compared to what can happen

223
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:30,720
someone hacked your National Grid and

224
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,940
sadly my case studies include just that

225
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:38,458
so my literature review included 10 case

226
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:42,080
studies these were David bass so big

227
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,020
sassa conflicker stuxnet

228
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,060
the Worcester air traffic Communications

229
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,680
Night Dragon moochi Shire oil spill

230
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,899
zataboom and Ukrainian power outages

231
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:57,420
today I will talk about three if anyone

232
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,980
wants to hear more about the others I am

233
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,720
happy to share the full document

234
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,360
so over a three-month period in the year

235
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,220
2000 between 800 sorry

236
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,880
friends

237
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,339
I think it's

238
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:20,339
I think it's 800 000 but it might be 80

239
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:22,620
000 sorry over three month period in the

240
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,899
year 2000 between

241
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:25,740
um

242
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,600
yeah eight hundred thousand and one

243
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,779
million liters of untreated sewage was

244
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,300
released into storm drain

245
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,920
um water where it leaked into local

246
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,540
waterways

247
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,399
from the waterways the sewage reached

248
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,800
local parks rivers and property of local

249
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,099
hotel

250
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,839
um and this was in Queensland Sunshine

251
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,940
Coast Australia

252
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,220
so this caused the death of marine life

253
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,760
the water turned black and an unpleasant

254
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,880
smell lingered in surrounded areas

255
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,860
one day within the three month period

256
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,100
which was the 23rd of April 2000 the

257
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,839
attacker gained access to the public

258
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,620
distribution system by logging in at one

259
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,140
pump station with this access the

260
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,480
Intruder sent messages to corrupt the

261
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,540
system from the said pump stations these

262
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,760
messages disabled alarms to alert staff

263
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,580
of faults at four pumping stations using

264
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,860
the laptop and a radio transmitter it

265
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,980
had been claimed by the ifip that the

266
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,040
attacker managed to control 150 sewerage

267
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,440
pumping stations the attacker gained

268
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,420
access just after half seven in the

269
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,480
evening and conducted just ah and

270
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,600
concluded after nine in the evening

271
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,880
it supposedly took him at least 46

272
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,560
attempts to gain control of the sewage

273
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,660
system

274
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,339
so it turns out that the person who did

275
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:50,519
this was somebody who had applied to

276
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:54,120
work for the company they attacked and

277
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,040
because they were because they were

278
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,480
rejected

279
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,120
they did this as Revenge

280
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,240
so he was arrested in his car and it

281
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,579
contained all the equipment needed for

282
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:07,800
the Cyber attack

283
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,519
um

284
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:11,160
and on his laptop he had software that

285
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,019
had the ability to communicate with the

286
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:15,360
PDS and a sewage plant

287
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,640
so it's been confirmed that there wasn't

288
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,279
any existing documentation such as an

289
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,860
information security policy or any

290
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:27,360
security procedures in place at the time

291
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,800
so the next one I'm going to talk about

292
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,000
is sassa

293
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:37,620
so on the 1st of May 2004 the computer

294
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,440
worm sassa made an appearance it

295
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,260
exploits cve

296
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,930
2003 0533

297
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,140
[Music]

298
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:46,860
um

299
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,120
so

300
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,920
vulnerability that Microsoft has

301
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,600
released a patch for on the 13th and

302
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,019
28th of April 2004. so this emphasizes

303
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:58,339
just how vital patch management is

304
00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:00,180
so

305
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,360
sorry sassa infected many organizations

306
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,860
including

307
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,440
um British Airway Airways the maritime

308
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,380
and Coast Guard agency American Express

309
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:13,320
the European commission had headquarters

310
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,620
in Brussels Delta Airlines in Atlanta

311
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,660
and it caused several seven hours of

312
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,140
damage causing 40 flights to be canceled

313
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,700
losing finances to the company and

314
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,700
inconveniences to customers and the rail

315
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,740
Court who had to stop trains from

316
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,300
running due to lack of communication

317
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,300
between drivers and Signal men

318
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,940
so the worm was first discovered when it

319
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,339
exploited a buffer over run with the

320
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:40,380
local security Authority subsystem

321
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,980
service process so

322
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,680
to gain remote access to an XP or

323
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,639
Windows 2000 system the lsas

324
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,920
vulnerability is exploited it supposedly

325
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,399
uses TCP Port

326
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,860
455 so an

327
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:03,060
SMP port and it's way onto sorry it uses

328
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,700
the port 445 as its way onto computers

329
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,220
which is an SMB Port it's been claimed

330
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,260
to use port 139 by some Microsoft

331
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,120
researchers however

332
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,120
so once it gains access to the computer

333
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,779
it then starts 128 scanning threats to

334
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:20,820
find vulnerable vulnerable systems that

335
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,160
are networked to the host computer

336
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,800
from that computer

337
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,120
from that computer vulnerable computers

338
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,420
are then probed at Port 445 to spread

339
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,560
the worm

340
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,399
so this went on a long way and FAFSA was

341
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:38,940
written by a 30 year old a German who is

342
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,040
now a computer science graduate

343
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,279
uh called Sven Jackson when he coded the

344
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:47,279
worm he was 17 years old so he's not 30

345
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,100
year old anymore he's got to be 36 or 37

346
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,339
because I wrote this six years ago so he

347
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:55,079
was arrested just days before his 18th

348
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:56,820
birthday and avoided being trialled as

349
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,139
an adult

350
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:00,360
and so the last one is a bit of a

351
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,680
difficult one to talk about because of

352
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,180
what it's tuned into

353
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,880
so the Ukraine nuclear power plant

354
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,560
outages

355
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,959
on the 23rd of December

356
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:13,560
the Ivano frankovitz I hope I said that

357
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,019
right region of Ukraine lost power due

358
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:17,820
to a Cyber attack against three known

359
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:21,180
Regional power distribution companies

360
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,279
so there are several aspects of the

361
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,560
attack reconnaissance reconnaissance was

362
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,240
carried out in the form of speefficient

363
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,980
to gain access to the business networks

364
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,100
and black energy was found on all of the

365
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,800
networks attacked it's possibility that

366
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,540
the Spearfish and energy contains the

367
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,779
most malicious payloads black energy

368
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:42,000
um so I haven't actually looked into

369
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,100
this since then I imagine there's small

370
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,519
details on that being confirmed now

371
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,579
um so once the artwork well sorry once

372
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:52,260
the access to the network was granted

373
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,639
credentials from the business were

374
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:56,760
stolen vpns were used to enter the into

375
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,339
the the ICS networks and remote access

376
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:01,440
tools used for the scada systems would

377
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,940
then utilized which means the attackers

378
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,279
had remote access

379
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,939
so

380
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:12,120
this didn't only happen once while I was

381
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,699
while I was writing my dissertation

382
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:18,120
there was a second attack on Ukraine

383
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,899
so on the 17th of December 2016 just

384
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:24,899
before midnight an area of Kiev the

385
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:27,180
capital city of Ukraine lost power

386
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,820
the power outage occurred less than a

387
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,260
week before the anniversary of the

388
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,760
previous attack

389
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,699
and

390
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:37,920
so as you can imagine back then everyone

391
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,920
was pointing fingers at Russia

392
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,160
and I believe I have a quote from what I

393
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,500
wrote in my dissertation so with Russia

394
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,360
and America's current relationship if

395
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,339
Russia is behind the attacks it could be

396
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:52,079
assumed that America is at risk of a

397
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,220
similar attack

398
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,320
Kiev only lost power for 45 minutes

399
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,000
however it's been suggested that because

400
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,920
America's grid is so Advanced and fully

401
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,959
automated it would be a lot harder to

402
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,220
fix so people would be left without

403
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,680
power for days

404
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,199
um so the issue is that we now know that

405
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,180
these were prerequisite for the conflict

406
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,920
happening at the moment which is really

407
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,160
sad

408
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,839
so next I'm going to go on to the

409
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,639
primary research I did and let me just

410
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:20,459
check the time okay so private research

411
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:22,139
was a success in gathering information

412
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:24,660
that was needed however it was not

413
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,699
possible to find out the downtime

414
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:29,339
necessary to replace the scada system as

415
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:31,079
a consensus is that the actual systems

416
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:32,459
are not the main risk but the person

417
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:35,699
personnel and educated insecurity are

418
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:38,399
so having an ISP in place and enforced

419
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,380
is the next step to increase in the

420
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,600
security of scada systems so I spoke to

421
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,160
three people and I'm going to talk about

422
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,660
them now

423
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,579
so the first person I interviewed was an

424
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:50,100
ex-employee of the company Unilever and

425
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,320
he had worked there for 27 years as his

426
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,600
guard developer so we began working

427
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,579
there the process is to manufacture the

428
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:59,579
product Walls ice cream was manual and

429
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:01,320
over the years of over the years

430
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,839
automation data monitoring and Analysis

431
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,780
were added in the shape of scada systems

432
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,880
so it was fascinating hearing about how

433
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,640
how him as a control engineer was the

434
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,220
one who introduced the scada system and

435
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,859
automated over the years and eventually

436
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:19,619
it became a network starter system with

437
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:21,839
a connection to the World Wide Web so I

438
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,459
asked him several questions including

439
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,319
whether he saw a risk in being connected

440
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,240
to the internet whether they had

441
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,860
information security policies in place

442
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,919
whether the policies were enforced and

443
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,160
whether they had a data recovery plan

444
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,440
he shared that he'd hadn't considered

445
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,720
the risk of the factory being hacked and

446
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,520
said that the company would lose a lot

447
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,620
of money should the temperature controls

448
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,140
be meddled with well ice cream would

449
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,940
melt everywhere

450
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,980
so as it happens they did have security

451
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,260
policies but mainly for the business

452
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,539
systems and not specifically for the

453
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:57,000
scada systems they also had a disaster

454
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,460
recovery plans however if the policies

455
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,440
didn't cover the scada systems I can't

456
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,840
be sure how good those were either it

457
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,880
was an interesting conversation and it

458
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,919
solidified the need for scada-specific

459
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,140
policy documents

460
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,700
so the next one I'm going to talk about

461
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,980
is someone who worked at Capital and

462
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,400
vandaland as a scada developer so the

463
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,740
first question I asked him was whether

464
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,780
the company had any isps

465
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,000
information security policies to which

466
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,559
she said there definitely was one at

467
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:27,059
Kepler

468
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:29,400
um as as it was demanded by management

469
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,500
but at vandalins he stated that there

470
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,440
were none in place as far as he knew

471
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,360
so he justified this by saying the

472
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,160
automation was kept off the internet so

473
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,980
it was air gapped one quote I included

474
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,200
in my writer was if you want my honest

475
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,820
opinion about security with Control

476
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,460
Systems I don't think it's considered At

477
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,160
All by anybody it's a lasting on

478
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,660
anybody's mind

479
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,299
he said that if he has remote access to

480
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,280
the system then there's a way for

481
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,900
attackers to get in

482
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,580
so he always thinks guard assistant

483
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,440
should be air-gapped

484
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,320
once again I was con I had convincing

485
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,120
evidence that security policies and

486
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,220
procedures in scada facilities are

487
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,960
lacking and that the document I was

488
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,220
creating was needed

489
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,679
so the final piece I spoke to worked at

490
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:17,880
the National Grid

491
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,220
so I was happy to hear that the National

492
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,380
Grid is very secure and the company

493
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,460
takes information security seriously

494
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:28,140
they change all of the off-shelf

495
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,500
products generic passwords and usernames

496
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,799
and use a third-party IDs supplier who

497
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,960
also supplies internals training and

498
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,820
business support should the scada

499
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,740
engineers need any help

500
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,260
so this was six years ago and I imagine

501
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,940
things have only got better since then

502
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,460
so the network analysts get basic

503
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,900
Network confusion detection where they

504
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,120
be able to recognize traits of things

505
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,120
like buffer overflows anybody who asks

506
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,120
for security training gets it

507
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,280
um so well done National Grid so they

508
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,440
were not specific policies for scada but

509
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,480
he knew scada was mentioned in the

510
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,179
generic information security policies he

511
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:09,179
spoke to me about making sure that each

512
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:10,860
person had the correct level of access

513
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,799
and the principle of his privilege

514
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:15,720
we spoke about patch management and

515
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,039
about how pouches would need to be

516
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,559
tested before being implemented he

517
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:20,940
explained that the risk of a

518
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,860
vulnerability being exploited before the

519
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,600
patch and the risk of a new patch

520
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,400
Bringing Down the system needed to be

521
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,380
weighed up very carefully

522
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,419
I was definitely impressed with the

523
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:32,460
responses and this restored my faith in

524
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,220
scada security it was an example of how

525
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,500
implementing and enforcing policies was

526
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,320
the crack scope with the crack scope can

527
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,299
decrease the risk of a successful attack

528
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:44,160
so the next one I'm going to talk about

529
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,020
is a conversation I had with my own

530
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,240
Grandad so he wasn't named as my

531
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,799
granddad on my dissertation I named him

532
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:51,120
by his name

533
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,740
but I spoke to him about the scada

534
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,200
attacks that end up on the news and as

535
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,120
someone who has a news channel on all

536
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,220
day he had some really good comments and

537
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,740
he's in his 80s and he's unable to use a

538
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,780
mouse he literally can't use a computer

539
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,940
but he could see just how bad these were

540
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,520
and a quote from him is surely they

541
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,900
should be able to do something about it

542
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:13,020
and surely we should and over the past

543
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,480
few years thankfully the industry has

544
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,679
been doing something about it

545
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,260
so to create the information security

546
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:26,100
policy documents and the isms I looked

547
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,700
at existing documents such as ISO 27001

548
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,059
27002 which I had access through access

549
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:38,700
to through uni thankflame and Isa 99 and

550
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,039
Sandia National Laboratories I looked at

551
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,720
a lot more than that I probably looked

552
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,860
at about

553
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,780
50 different policy documents from

554
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,220
companies that shared their policies

555
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,140
online and there was one specific

556
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,000
University that had really good security

557
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,580
policies and but I can't remember their

558
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,340
name but if anyone wants um wants to

559
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,900
know who they were just pop me a message

560
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,000
and I'll find out

561
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,840
um

562
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,080
so using them I took the best practices

563
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,720
and I put all the best practices

564
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,960
together into a document that would be

565
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,020
ideal for scada pretty much so I did

566
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,539
explain it in this but I

567
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:18,720
so this is a quote from my dissertation

568
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,280
um it's pretty much what I just said so

569
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,440
I'm happy to share the slides but that's

570
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,659
quote for my dissertation

571
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:29,880
um but I have just said it so the

572
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,760
sections included the purpose scope

573
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,919
structure organizational information

574
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:38,880
data security interested parties the

575
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,700
isms access controls platform security

576

continuity redundant employment and

582
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,500
revision history so it was a massive

583
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,120
document that was at the back of my

584
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,860
dissertation

585
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,600
um and to this day I'm still really

586
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,159
proud of it

587
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:07,200
um in a longer version of this talk I

588
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,360
would go through each section and how

589
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,159
each section applies to scada security

590
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:14,280
so if I do that in the future I'll then

591
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,980
make sure to share it so

592
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,260
as I mentioned earlier I had aimed to

593
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,600
educate those with access to the systems

594
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,700
and restrict authorized access to their

595
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,120
systems so I felt like them on the

596
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,280
document managed both of them but I

597
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,320
needed to get it evaluated in order to

598
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,500
pass a dissertation so I'd met someone

599
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,679
on LinkedIn who kindly offered to look

600
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,600
over the document and give his feedback

601
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,640
on it he was well he is a security

602
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,940
engineer and to this day we've actually

603
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,559
become quite good friends I barely knew

604
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,960
him at this point but he's one of my

605
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,440
best mentors so was I successful

606
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,200
so to quote him

607
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,600
the ISP has been thoroughly researched

608
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,460
and all the section headers were valid

609
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:02,460
however as the document was written by a

610
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,659
novice

611
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:05,340
there was jargon that should have been

612
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,840
used in certain places that wasn't

613
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,179
originally known about there were also

614
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:11,520
specific ways policies are expressed

615
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,960
within the industry that were not

616
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,299
followed such as the word should be an

617
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:17,159
inappropriate for a policy document as

618
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:19,620
the word must is more appropriate

619
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,960
to give a final evaluation of the ISP

620
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,960
document a security sorry this is

621
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,179
I just went into my write-up then so

622
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:30,000
yeah my friend Andrew wrote having

623
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,200
reviewed the start of information

624
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,000
security policy it's clear to see that

625
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,620
Jenny has researched some sensible

626
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,880
conclusions

627
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,679
has reached some sensible conclusions

628
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,539
and as we should while researched this

629
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:41,220
topic taking it into account the rapid

630
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,080
recent change of scada systems and the

631
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,360
surrounding technology the policy has

632
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,400
the Hallmarks and structure of a robust

633
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,900
and prescriptive information security

634
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,120
document

635
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,820
so I'm quite proud of that especially

636
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,760
for a 21 year old looking back all I can

637
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,520
see is issues but I'm still proud of it

638
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,679
so

639
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,419
there's a chance this will actually link

640
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,700
to my PhD

641
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,880
so I'm hoping to look into where the

642
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,039
products out there are actually good for

643
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,620
companies and what their efficacies are

644
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:17,179
and I do want to focus on scada security

645
00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:20,640
so I'm yet to get my policy sorry I'm

646
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,340
yet to get my proposal accepted but I'm

647
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:26,460
hoping that it will look at that

648
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,100
so what I hope you'll take from this so

649
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,900
compliance plays a large part in

650
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,480
mitigating cyber security risks

651
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,460
cyber security is a sector where you can

652
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,980
make real world contributions like just

653
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,559
think of the Ukraine stuff and Shout out

654
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:41,940
about something when you do it not half

655
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,559
a decade later because I really should

656
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:45,120
have shared this policy around when I

657
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,400
wrote it and I'm really glad that there

658
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,400
are other things like this out there now

659
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,320
um but I feel like this could have been

660
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,380
used and saved some people some time so

661
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,480
I should have shouted about it so

662
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,740
thank you so much

663
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,600
thank you very much for that it was

664
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,860
really interesting do we have any

665
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,900
questions from the audience

666
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,120
because I have one question for you I'm

667
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,320
gonna stand over here so people can

668
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,640
actually see me

669
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,720
um

670
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,600
do you think that we've seen an

671
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,980
improvement

672
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,860
in the scada security systems that we

673
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:20,940
have

674
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:24,059
we actually learned are you seeing any

675
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:25,440
evidence that we've learned lessons and

676
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,240
you feel like actually we are improving

677
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,500
learning lessons from these sorts of

678
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,960
attacks that have happened or are we

679
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,340
still kind of batting our head against

680
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,539
the same wall

681
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:37,620
so for especially for um critical

682
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,659
National infrastructure

683
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:41,820
there are requirements in place now for

684
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:44,159
them to be secure I believe back then

685
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,559
the National Grid were keeping their

686
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,659
systems secure because it was the best

687
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:50,700
thing to do and not because they were

688
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,960
told they had to

689
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,240
well now there's a lot in place

690
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,720
um companies have like iot

691
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,539
um secure certifications

692
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:01,980
um

693
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,059
I think we're going in the right

694
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:04,440
direction A lot's happened in six years

695
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,940
and if I had more time I would have

696
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,279
loved to touch on that and and obviously

697
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:10,020
like if you look at critical National

698
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,159
infrastructure and you're looking at

699
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:14,039
Power stations you can see the drive I

700
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:15,720
guess for the government to put in place

701
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,539
things that would uh make them more

702
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:20,400
secure but what about things like Farms

703
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,919
that would use Scottish security but

704
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:25,380
perhaps wouldn't have the drive of the

705
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,419
government and policy behind it to sort

706
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:30,840
of say you need to secure this

707
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,520
I think without

708
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,380
funding from the government they're not

709
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,360
going to do it

710
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,919
um

711
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,140
I know that there are funding grants out

712
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:43,320
there for smaller companies to become

713
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,600
more secure I'm not sure if there are

714
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,120
any scada specific ones

715
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,740
um but

716
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,120
because it's everywhere right so that's

717
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,100
the problem that's okay for critical

718
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,480
National infrastructure but if it's

719
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,580
proliferated outside of that we can

720
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,320
still have the same problem I'd be

721
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,299
interested to see what walls is what

722
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:02,520
Unilever Unilever walls is like now

723
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,960
whether they've got anything in place

724
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,179
yeah because the guy I spoke to he did

725
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:07,620
he didn't work there at that point he

726
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,919
worked at another company and but he was

727
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:12,659
shocked when I said well what would

728
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:14,100
happen if someone hacked in he was like

729
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,960
I never thought of that he worked there

730
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,580
for 27 years and never thought of it

731
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:20,400
yeah yeah it's got a big big change to

732
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,020
happen then well thank you so much for

733
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:25,279
that it was awesome love the talk
