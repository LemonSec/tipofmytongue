1
00:00:01,079 --> 00:00:03,540
go far with go for it lessons from the

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:04,920
past

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,240
um

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,760
the sort of idea behind it is actually

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,940
a crazy one it all started when

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,740
um

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,960
with something which we can in German

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,900
called a schnappsidy and by the way uh

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,840
apologies for the accent

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,439
um

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,960
there is that crazy idea that was sort

12
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,800
of come into existence with Dan con uh

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,960
some other more crazy people in our

14
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,079
industry some of I have yet to to meet

15
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,660
in real life hi Lisa

16
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,059
um and by the way if you don't follow

17
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:44,700
Dan please do so because he's definitely

18
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,860
way younger than I am and much cooler

19
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,579
it's real

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,260
so quite often

21
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,600
we think that

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,719
problems we Face are new and and unheard

23
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,719
of before where in reality

24
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:06,180
they have been around for decades

25
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,760
and to see the approaches of how they're

26
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,360
going to be solved or how they were try

27
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,760
to be solved can help us to approach

28
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,200
them today

29
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,540
and for that

30
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,540
um I have one thing prepared which is

31
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,619
also on Twitter if you go for uh the

32
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,840
hashtag go forward or for Daniel or mine

33
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,759
Twitter account you can see that

34
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,100
challenge in terms of when was this

35
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,180
message

36
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,119
creating a simple yet secure Cipher by

37
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:39,000
which means messages can be sealed when

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,140
would that

39
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,020
um sort of coined when was that

40
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,619
um used in in this sense and now sort of

41
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:49,259
reveal that secret at the end of the

42
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:50,340
show

43
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,960
um

44
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,840
computer security so

45
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,860
there have been the usual issues before

46
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,880
before Windows 98 by the way and and um

47
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,799
worrying about a computer breach is not

48
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,439
the only one and the risk for cyber

49
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,919
attacks seems to be on the rise still uh

50
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,379
and by the way uh shame on anyone who

51
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:16,020
thinks evil of it that I am putting

52
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,400
cyber risks

53
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,400
and windows in the same picture

54
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,620
nope

55
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,020
enjoy your next lamp party

56
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,599
if you do more the document

57
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,580
pictured on the right has some

58
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,319
interesting stuff in it

59
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,920
the chapter is or one chapter is titled

60
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,020
automated decision making applications

61
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,140
continue to make bad decisions until

62
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,379
problems are corrected so anyone who

63
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:45,780
doesn't think of Big Data algorithms

64
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,739
here

65
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:50,519
we'll see another one reads us criminals

66
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:52,860
exploited weaknesses and basic

67
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,720
management controls

68
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,319
what I do Wonder uh what is why is that

69
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,260
phrased in the past tense

70
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,060
they still do I think

71
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,120
one more to mention management does not

72
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,459
play sufficient

73
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:11,580
emphasis on controlling systems and that

74
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,760
document is from June 1976

75
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,060
uh where there's a subparagraph in that

76
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,879
management did not Ascend assess

77
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,760
potential threats to the systems

78
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,640
no 50 years back

79
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,760
the full document basically lists all we

80
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,180
have all we Face still today sorry

81
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:33,900
um

82
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,760
and quite likely

83
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,640
the following is still true

84
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,580
in terms of

85
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,379
manipulation of input

86
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,299
interception of communication systems

87
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:52,260
and that's again 1975.

88
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,260
we have all this stuff in here which we

89
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,440
are facing as of today

90
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,900
user security the next element yeah

91
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,940
computer security is now more important

92
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,080
than ever

93
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,180
come on

94
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,340
1979

95
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,099
we have 2022 and that can be the same

96
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:13,439
headline for today

97
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,139
safeguarding computer files and the the

98
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:18,540
interesting things here are in this one

99
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,298
and in this one statistically the most

100
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:24,960
serious problems in the computer

101
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,780
room are data processing and operator

102
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,280
errors

103
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,220
huh inside of that's whatever you want

104
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,220
to call it the user in itself

105
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,800
therefore uses security or safeguarding

106
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,060
the files when you think of it

107
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,280
and it's

108
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,340
probably hard to read for the guys on on

109
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,639
here in in real life maybe uh online can

110
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,340
read it better it's referring to a movie

111
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,380
we have all seen at least I have seen

112
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,639
when I was young

113
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,259
war games

114
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:00,660
you know safeguarding computer files and

115
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,820
that actually is a letter from a reader

116
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,860
to that um

117
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,680
to that newspaper asking whether these

118
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,620
things are taken care of

119
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,620
yeah one safeguard users can apply is a

120
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,740
password Here We Go passwords the

121
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,660
interesting one is here

122
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,720
um

123
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,979
despite the numerous accounting and

124
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:25,139
other ridges controls that characterize

125
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:27,720
the paper environment users were

126
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,419
inclined to say if there are any

127
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:33,300
security problems

128
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,539
presumably the data processor nowadays

129
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:39,479
called the admin will take care of it

130
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:42,660
so what we read in this year and what we

131
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,680
have all still today is I think what

132
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,940
Douglas Adams called a a set field

133
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,759
someone else's problem

134
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,820
I don't care about it I don't see it I

135
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,400
don't want to take care of it it's not

136
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,880
my business

137
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,620
taking me to

138
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,259
am I talking about users identity theft

139
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:09,900
all right users passwords

140
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,639
we all have that

141
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:15,600
justice department in November 2074

142
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,620
talked about it in relation to

143
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,020
um Social Security numbers

144
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,620
and it's again a revolving topic we have

145
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:29,220
the same thing in 1998 and the same

146
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,800
thing in 2005 and still today you can

147
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,740
find organizations out there that are

148
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,020
using in the U.S Social Security numbers

149
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:41,720
or whatever kind of easily forcible

150
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,860
identifier for users

151
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,620
that leads to when we're talking about

152
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,060
users

153
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,360
that leads to data security

154
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,180
ID theft is usually something which

155
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,400
happens online on a larger scale with

156
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,380
we're talking about identities taken

157
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,280
away

158
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,800
initial access brokers

159
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,500
these are sort of the current phrases of

160
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,900
problems they were facing 50 years ago

161
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:17,419
where yeah now you usual suspect again

162
00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:21,479
ssn's July 77 reports cites danger

163
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:24,240
office of a privacy breach were in the

164
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,220
same way the experts claim to have

165
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,560
plucked the Gap leading to a computer

166
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,660
breach it's related

167
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,180
and it's the interesting finding here is

168
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,060
this Gap I'm afraid

169
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,880
typically of the kind of human error

170
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,880
that renders ineffective even the best

171
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,759
design safeguards to contain uh

172
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:47,880

174
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:55,560
on the right hand side you have

175
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,620
another document talking about data

176

okay inference controls access controls

00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:23,580
if you

185
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:26,359
put this

it's down here sorry

190
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,059
maybe we can change that a little bit

191
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:38,838

00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,540
are there any members of isaka here

199
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,420
around or have you heard about isaka

200
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,260
that con

201
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,760
uh that um

202
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,320
group of Information Security

203
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,440
Professionals Equity funding scandal in

204
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,839
the early 70s was about

205
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:22,980
generating false IDs to have

206
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,620
um insurance policies assigned to these

207
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,380
false non-existent IDs and then they

208
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,899
were using to resell these false

209
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:34,140
security policies to the back insurer

210
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,600
and made money out of it and it was the

211
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,880
first time that

212
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,200
the idea of auditing information

213
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,899
um processing systems

214
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:48,240
in the financial area

215
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,959
and that was actually the the the

216
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,660
initiator the spark that created cobit

217
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,279
huh

218
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:58,380
a koble sorry

219
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,260
um and the uh isaka which is now called

220
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,839
was then founded by that way on the end

221
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,640
so if we put these things together

222
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,600
that's a handwritten note on a document

223
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,899
that note is from

224
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:19,640
1968 when I was nine

225
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:24,620

you can go through classification of

238
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,079
the interesting part spillage

239
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,700
inadvertent dump

240
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,000
that what's they called

241
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,579
foreign access

242
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:07,620
an inadvertent dump was someone

243
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,300
retrieving the data without an

244
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,839
authorization so

245
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:21,180
we as shown we have had all these issues

246
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,839
50 years back 60 years back

247
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:27,420
and what we still do

248
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:31,699
is we try to remediate by Tech

249
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,140
and we have tried that for many years

250
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,579
um the the

251
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:38,880
admittedly the business is good no we

252
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,579
all learn and earned our money from that

253
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:44,279
but the element here is

254
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,019
and I think it's time to broaden the

255
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:48,720
view a bit here is about

256
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,279
what is the influence Tash has on risk

257
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,880
and going back to 1938

258
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,200
and we're talking about the car

259
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,579
technology here

260
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:01,920
not your Merc

261
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,500
better breaks will reduce the absolute

262
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,500
size of the minimum stopping zone is it

263
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,360
true

264
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,300
but the driver soon learns that this new

265
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,839
Zone and since it has its field Zone

266
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,720
ratio which remains constant he allows

267
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,880
only the same relative margin between

268
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,980
the field and the Zone in essence what

269
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,980
that is in that plain old English is the

270
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,540
better the breaks we are the later we

271
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,719
break

272
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:34,200
and that study or a similar study was

273
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,519
replicated in the late 80s early 90s

274
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:41,640
back in in my home place in Germany

275
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,320
I'm not living in Munich but that was

276
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,079
carried out in Munich where a couple of

277
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,300
taxis were equipped with

278
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,279
um

279
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,200
anti-lock brake systems and the other

280
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,760
ones hadn't

281
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,980
the effect was that they were monitoring

282
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,480
while they were monitoring the taxi

283
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,060
drivers those who knew that they had ABS

284
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,459
installed they were riskier in their

285
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:04,440
behavior in their driving behavior

286
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,500
so whenever we have a compensating

287
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,980
technical element our Behavior turns

288
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,060
tends to get riskier

289
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,560
um

290
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,260
when you look at and the same is is true

291
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,959
for newer cars

292
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:22,560
um

293
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,120
my one is

294
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,860
five years old

295
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,620
maybe I'm kind of risky in my behavior

296
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,320
this is an excerpt from a studying done

297
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,200
in Norway newer cars are generally more

298
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,899
comfortable calm causing less noise and

299
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,540
vibration they're also in general

300
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,000
pictured promoted conceived as

301
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,100
technically safer

302
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,260
it is possible that drivers take

303
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,560
advantage of that perceived safety

304
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,440
to adopt the last defensive style and

305
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,560
driving

306
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,260
so

307
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,279
transfer that

308
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,920
password policies

309
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,500
huh do we have to change every 30 days

310
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,040
every 90 days does it make us safer

311
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,440
or is it creating a riskier behavior by

312
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,820
our users

313
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,399
and you can take that and by the way

314
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,279
what it introduces

315
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,519
is that case against commercial

316
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:23,639
antivirus software risk and homeostasis

317
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:25,440
which is the theory behind risk camera

318
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,440
status and information problems in cyber

319
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,320
security I will come to that because now

320
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,620
it's also time to wrap up

321
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,060
but I want to leave one thing here

322
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,800
another Tax Solution

323
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,680
will it make us safer I don't think that

324
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,880
we will see

325
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,320
so talking about risk management

326
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,920
as I mentioned the idea or Theory be is

327
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,260
called risk homeostasis

328
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,240
and

329
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,880
what's behind is basically it

330
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,800
transferred a little bit an organization

331
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,019
is in essence

332
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:07,199
a group of people where each person in

333
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,199
it has an individual risk level

334
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:12,600
a level of acceptance of risk a risk

335
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,820
compensation level and that's a dynamic

336
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,620
balance

337
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,680
according to the theory between that

338
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,500
perceived risk and the security felt

339
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,800
which seems to impact

340
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,320
to be impacted by the level of security

341
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,480
provided

342
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,899
so the user Behavior

343
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:36,180
if I have a very strict risk and

344
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,880
security environment might even become

345
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,740
more riskier

346
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,899
now combine that with the set field

347
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:44,699
mentioned before and you know what I'm

348
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:47,279
talking about so the in person an

349
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,399
individual is that base identity and our

350
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,320
risk management needs to incorporate

351
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,540
that one and now

352
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,060
and by the way I've provided with the

353
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,279
with the final slide if you take it from

354
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,920
there and I'll share it all the links to

355
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,440
these Snippets from the from the past

356
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,740
and also to the studies and everything

357
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,779
so

358
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:11,120
um

359
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,279
in that sense

360
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:17,040
the perceived security protection as an

361
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,940
enabler of a riskier I.T Behavior I

362
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,800
leave that as a question for you as a

363
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,680
takeaway for the lessons and now I see

364
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,779
that I have another

365
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,000
issue here on my slide as I mentioned

366
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,339
before don't work last minute on your

367
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:37,040
slide sets one lesson from an old guy

368
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:42,380
but it should work anyway

369
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,839
hang on

370
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,579
so lessons

371
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:50,880
that's a part here

372
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,000
is there a full sense of security in all

373
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,880
the effort we have put out into the

374
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,220
technical measures into controls

375
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,199
it seems to be

376
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,880
don't take me wrong

377
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,579
do we have to throw away the tack no

378
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:11,699
certainly not because it will help us to

379
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:14,160
reduce our attack surface then the other

380
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,579
thing we have to do as a lesson is to do

381
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:20,220
better and to do to do different and the

382
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,199
one thing we need to do is

383
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:25,799
talk about cyber resilience

384
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:28,439
the measures behind implementing

385
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:30,660
security controls embedded into our

386
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,000
business process embedded into or

387
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,700
aligned to our user Behavior and the

388
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,760
task we have with our users

389
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:43,380
and as it has been documented already

390
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,260
diversity and inclusivity

391
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:51,919
it Crea reduces our risks by 50 percent

392
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,960
and

393
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,260
the last one here an all-girl computers

394
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,500
environment is not a bad thing but I

395
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,820
want you

396
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,340
if it's one lesson you take away from us

397
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,559
today

398
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:11,700
the diversity element of having

399
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,940
people from different places in your

400
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,840
teams whether it's non-it or I.T is

401
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,000
really helping you to reduce your risk

402
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,880
behavior because people tend to talk

403
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,700
about it differently and group thinking

404
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,640
like Phil Ingram mentioned it

405
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,220
will not happen in that sense that we

406
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,900
are

407
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,780
reducing our

408
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,460
sort of

409
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,740
risk awareness by simply saying yeah

410
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,600
everybody else doesn't think it is a

411
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,559
risk

412
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:47,280
now be diverse and then the side effect

413
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,740
is

414
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:52,500
we don't think of that as a specialty

415
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,320
anymore because again such a headline

416
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,700
can also be up today

417
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:01,500
thank you

418
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,100
any questions

419
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,940
sure

420
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,059
hi yeah I have a question so you talked

421
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:13,440
a little bit about

422
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,020
um Ai and whether or not it can make you

423
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,400
more secure so I have a question that's

424
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,740
maybe a bit of a nasty question but when

425
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,020
we're developing Technologies perhaps

426
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,539
with the good intention of them helping

427
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,580
make us more secure how much

428
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,039
responsibility do the innovators need to

429
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,679
have in thinking ahead of what happens

430
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,299
to that technology as it develops

431
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:34,500
because we've seen this happen with

432
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,760
blockchain we've seen this happen with

433
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,460
webs three or happening with web3 so my

434
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,500
question is kind of like how do we build

435
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,980
in both security and I guess privacy to

436
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,960
some degree into the tools that we're

437
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,280
innovating

438
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,440
well the

439
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,080
the first of all it's not an easy answer

440
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,340
to find here

441
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:53,940
um

442
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,559
what I would

443
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:57,360
start with is

444
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,380
if we develop a security tool

445
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,840
keep the user in mind

446
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,320
what does it do to the perception of

447
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,620
risk for the user now if we deliver that

448
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,679
message again and again yeah we'll

449
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,880
we'll make you 99 sure it's safe

450
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,400
don't talk about 100

451
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,500
um

452
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,340
the perception we create is

453
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,919
I don't have to care about

454
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:31,679
and that's the element that needs to be

455
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,620
sort of changed

456
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:38,400
ubiquity of of computer devices uh how

457
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,900
many smartphones can I find here

458
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,140
probably 20 even more

459
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:46,080
whatever kind of community is is kind of

460
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,760
communicating with the internet with the

461
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,480
public internet has that element of risk

462
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,419
in embedded into it and that is the

463
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,580
moment where we say okay if I do develop

464
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,919
something whether it's a i-based ml

465
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:02,000
based whether we call it

466
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,140
web3 which I

467
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,240
highly doubt about any security issues

468
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,600
in there

469
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,140
sorry

470
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,200
um

471
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:14,580
we have to keep in mind that

472
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,820
if the perception we create is

473
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,980
I don't have to care

474
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,960
then we're making something wrong and

475
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,059
then it's a full mistake and that's the

476
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:26,520
part probably the the short answer to

477
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,200
your question Lisa

478
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,980
keep that in mind make sure that the

479
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:37,460
the need to care about is not diminished

480
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:42,080
any more questions

481
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:56,000
just yell at me come on

482
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,900
hello yeah

483
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,340
um so

484
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,020
in the earlier in the talk you had like

485
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,419
quite a lot of Snippets from 1968 some

486
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:05,580
even earlier yeah kind of explaining

487
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,860
that at that point you know security was

488
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,960
thought about at least maybe not

489
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,280
implemented but certainly thoughts about

490
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,280
and how they can circumvent that whereas

491
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,919
when I started in the industry 10 years

492
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,059
ago

493
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:19,559
there's a lot of people that weren't

494
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:21,480
very aware that were developing this how

495
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,340
do you think that that mismatch kind of

496
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,740
happened and isn't that then making the

497
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,659
whole thing very risky from a management

498
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:29,280
point of view that these lessons aren't

499
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,539
being learned even when they were

500
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:33,360
thought of well I think I've mentioned

501
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,659
two elements that play a role in here uh

502
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:38,460
number one

503
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,679
it's not my problem

504
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:43,860
yeah that it's the data processors

505
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,559
presumably taking care of that

506
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,000
um if we have

507
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,580
and this this is the way the whole it

508
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,919
started now it started as a small group

509
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:55,260
somewhere down in the cellar

510
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,460
um

511
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,860
probably not I often let out to see the

512
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,120
daylight or whatever you're going to

513
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,059
call it you all know these stereotypes

514
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:06,840
um but the part of that stereotype is a

515
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,700
truth that

516
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,220
I don't understand

517
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:14,400
it's not my business it's their job so

518
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,280
we have that someone else problem field

519
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,600
that

520
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,020
why should I care about it and

521
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:25,320
that is is one Element the other element

522
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,840
is

523
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,899
um

524
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,059
probably a

525
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:36,980
also a generation Ash element

526
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,179
when I started in it

527
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,260
ages ago

528
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:43,940
um

529
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,960
we were

530
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,020
keen on learning that stuff

531
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,900
how does it work yeah like you did in

532
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,720
your talk break this thing apart

533
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,480
nowadays

534
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,640
we don't do that anymore now we don't

535
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,340
look behind it we don't dare to question

536
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,299
it

537
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:06,500
and that's another element

538
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,580
one more

539
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:16,860
does anyone have a last question

540
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:20,719
one one oh one more there we go

541
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,460
me as a as a follow-up you were saying

542
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,539
that it's a shame that we can't break

543
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:26,700
into things and I agree with you on that

544
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,860
what do you think how can we make things

545
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,900
better so that they can be used do you

546
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,880
think it's uh the ability's not there or

547
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,280
do you think that it's actually

548
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,440
um the the the the want is not there

549
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,240
anymore

550
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,360
um

551
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,039
for

552
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:46,860
uh the the the want

553
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,179
I think

554
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:50,940
the want can be created if we start

555
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,820
talking about if we look at risky

556
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,620
behavior from that

557
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,080
do you know what happens

558
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,159
yeah

559
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:01,380
if you're using your smartphone and I'm

560
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:04,320
I have to admit I'm doing that much to

561
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,659
their

562
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:10,280
delightment with my kids

563
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:12,240
what's behind

564
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,179
did you question that

565
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:17,340
and that's one of the things we we have

566
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,200
to to

567
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,880
promote I guess

568
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,080
in in schools in in in in in in

569
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,020
forms like this whatever kind of element

570
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,580
is there

571
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:32,760
and I once had a um

572
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,700
a teacher of my my my my one of my sons

573
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,220
was like Hey can you pass by to school

574
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,539
and

575
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:41,880
give a whatever it was a two-hour

576
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,919
session and if you have some old Tech

577
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,320
bring it along so that we can really

578
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,880
break it apart

579
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,679
and they were coming in with crew

580
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,020
drivers and whatever and opened up the

581
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,600
desk or the the the the box of a of a

582
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,659
laptop pulling out the screen whatever

583
00:25:57,659 --> 00:25:58,200
um

584
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,020
I didn't bring along a CRT but that

585
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,340
would be a risky

586
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,440
um but that's the thing yeah

587
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,980
stay curious about how these things work

588
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:12,440
it's one element the other element is

589
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,779
simple

590
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:17,100
push it

591
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:21,379
change the mindset by talking about it

592
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,580
be more resilient

593
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:26,299
in that sense

594
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,840
fantastic one more question here in the

595
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,959
audience

596
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:37,679
you said that Diversified teams show 50

597
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,740
less risky Behavior right

598
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,380
isn't that a crucial danger for being

599
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,900
Innovative to show 50 less danger

600
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,679
because to be Innovative at some point

601
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,960
we have to take some risks right what

602
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,400
are your thoughts on that

603
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,980
it's it's sort of the the the the

604
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,779
counterpart to to the question that um

605
00:26:57,779 --> 00:27:00,179
Lisa forty just raised

606
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:02,880
um on the one hand side yes

607
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,960
Innovation means to take risks

608
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,299
do you take risk at all cost if you want

609
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:11,520
to innovate

610
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,279
and that's the point if I am willing to

611
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:16,440
take a risk to innovate to become a

612
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,500
Founder to you do a startup to

613
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,860
think of a certain problem in a

614
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,480
different way and to provide a solution

615
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,240
it is taking a risk

616
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,700
the element of that is if you do that

617
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:33,440
without any sort of

618
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,600
how to say that

619
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,140
um

620
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:40,860
control in in your own way okay if I do

621
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:43,380
that what happens in the aftermath yeah

622
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,919
if the solution you provide as the

623
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:49,380
Innovative solution and we can take the

624
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,020
the The Flipper zero as a sort of not

625
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,600
perfect example yeah it's an it's a

626
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,279
versatile tool

627
00:27:56,279 --> 00:28:00,659
the way it can be used can be dangerous

628
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:03,059
how do we overcome that so the idea of

629
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:04,860
doing The Flipper zero is not bad is

630
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:07,380
quite Innovative yeah it's helpful in

631
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:10,260
many aspects but it has side effects and

632
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:14,279
if you have that diversity in your team

633
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:17,940
you have a greater chance to overcome

634
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:21,059
that group thinking in terms of uh

635
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:22,980
that's a side effect we don't have to

636
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:26,220
talk about it will never materialize

637
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,320
or we don't even think about that

638
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,340
potential side effect

639
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:34,080
yeah

640
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,960
well I think that closes off the talk uh

641
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,580
we'll be back in 30 minutes with a talk

642
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:41,700
about hacking one's brains so tune in

643
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,520
for that long list of sources

644
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,879
see

645
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:53,829
[Applause]
