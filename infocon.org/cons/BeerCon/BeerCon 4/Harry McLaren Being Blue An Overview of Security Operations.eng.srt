1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:03,659
all right so without further Ado it

2
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:05,339
gives me immense pleasure to welcome

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,360
Harry McLaren to Berk on four so a very

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,559
brief bit of background and then I'll

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,440
let Harry do his stuff uh we met Harry

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,120
for the first time at Cyber Scotland

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,940
connect in September 2019 and he and

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,100
Stuart Hurst were putting on a gig that

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,480
they write us along to and the bear

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,300
Farmers did a little bit of a thing but

11
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,859
um in the Buddha of a lovely Road in

12
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,560
Edinburgh we devised and concocted a

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,500
thing called birkon

14
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,239
um and Harry was kicking around at that

15
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:34,680
and stew and we're all having a beer and

16
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,540
having a good idea a good time and

17
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,579
throwing a few ideas around and out of

18
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,980
that came back on one so it gives me

19
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,200
enormous pleasure again to welcome Harry

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,960
to birkon four hurry the floor is yours

21
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,460
mate carry on

22
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,920
thanks Mike appreciate it that seems

right thank you all for attending my

25
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,520
talk and we'll be talking about security

26
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,840
operations 101 AKA being blue

27
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,059
um my background is in cyber security

28
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:04,619
I've been an analyst an engineer

29
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:06,960
consultant but my current job is I'm a

company called senson

33
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,680
um as Mike mentioned that co-founded

34
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,119
cyberscon connect it's a community group

35
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,760
in Edinburgh and I'm also dyslexic just

36

um very quickly about sensor on that

38
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:22,979
we're a startup we build cyber security

39
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:24,960
software we're remote first and always

throughout

50
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,200
so coming up we're going to talk a

51
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,460
little bit about my journey so you

52
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,960
understand a bit more about who I am and

53
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,460
what I do if you talk about the

54
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,899
importance of cyber security as a

55
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:53,640
profession as an industry I'm going to

56
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,780
talk to you a bit about the blue team

57
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,640
from my point of view

58
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,619
um careers within the blue team and then

59
00:01:58,619 --> 00:01:59,759
we're going to talk about competencies

60
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,759
about Technical and Behavioral

61
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:05,759
so my journey I started in computer

62
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,280
support way back in 2006 when I was

63
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,080
about 18 years old sometimes a

64
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,540
technician fixing repairing computers I

65
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,220
then did a degree in cyber security and

66
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,200
digital forensics at Edinburgh Napier um

67
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,700
up in Edinburgh where I still live today

68
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,340
and then joined a Coca-Cola Dharma as a

69
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,520
senior analyst and later was promoted as

70
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,440
an engineer and then moved into

71
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,300
consultancy for about three or four

72
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,400
years uh helping design and build

73
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,920
security operations centers and then I

74
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,360
became a dharma's first product lead

75
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,280
focusing on the detection and response

76
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,560
domain and then that brings us all the

77
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,180
way up to today well as I mentioned I'm

78
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,120
a senior product manager

79
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,500
so I thought it was really good to

80
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,940
ground us first in the importance of

81
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,099
cyber security I suspect you all agree

82
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:48,420
with this already but I just wanted to

83
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,700
talk about it from a economical point of

84
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,160
view for a second so the world economic

85
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,780
Forum uh produced a really interesting

86
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,400
report every year called the global risk

87
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,980
report and for some time now they have

88
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,500
included cyber security failure as one

89
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,080
of the top risks so of course we could

90
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,700
all name many of the reasons why we

91
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,200
should care about cyber security you've

92
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,340
heard about it from several of the

93
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,440
speakers already from scada systems

94
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,000
through to the importance of testing

95
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,860
your own security both physically and

96
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,900
digitally but it's really interesting

97
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,420
that something as broad as the the

98
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,180
economy and the the globe is recognized

99
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,700
by their wef as you know a really

100
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,500
important thing so you can say the next

101
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,300
couple of years I think it's seventh and

102
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,040
then pushing down to eighth over the two

103
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,019
to five year Horizon ahead of things

104
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:32,940
like biodiversity loss

105
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,099
um the asset Bubble Burst the debt

106
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:36,780
crisis cyber security is seen as more

107
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,879
important than all of those things which

108
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,440
is really telling when you think about

109
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,840
you know how often it is underfunded

110
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,959
underappreciated

111
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,780
so let's move into the blue team so this

112
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,400
is from my point of view and there's

113
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,379
many different definitions of what it

114
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:54,000
means but when I say The Blue Team I'm

115
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,519
referring to security operations some

116
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:58,260
people might say sock which stands for

117
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,060
security operations center but

118
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,040
fundamentally for me it comes down to

119
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,860
being a defender or being a protector so

120
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,599
splitting back to four areas I think

121
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:09,000
that is about helping to prepare your

122
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,280
defenses so getting ready it's about

123
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,980
detecting threats so being aware and

124
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,620
watching responding to incidents when

125
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,540
they're detected and fundamentally

126
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,820
recovering the business

127
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,380
um it's a nice little graphic here that

128
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,880
popped to my Instagram several years ago

129
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,919
and I always include it as when I think

130
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,139
back to doing night shifts in a deep

131
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:30,840
dark dungeon in sight Hill in Edinburgh

132
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,060
it reminds me of this nice little

133
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,360
cartoon

134
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:38,220
um so let's talk about prepared offenses

135
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,720
um this is going to start with

136
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,100
fundamentally understanding what the

137
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,479
threat is this is often referred to as

138
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,520
the threat landscape this is often done

139
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,780
with a threat research threat

140
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,940
intelligence and then you need to answer

141
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,919
what are you protecting this is commonly

142
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,960
referred to as your attack surface

143
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,060
your attack surface is fundamentally to

144
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,759
answer the question you know what know

145
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,979
thyself what is it that you are trying

146
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:00,660
to protect and this is achieved through

147
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,340
forms of organizational intelligence

148
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,460
Asset Management crown jewels analysis

149
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,600
Etc

150
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,580
so you now have the the threats the

151
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,740
things that are looking to do you harm

152
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,720
and you know what they would do harm to

153
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,960
if they did something understanding your

154
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,820
vulnerability in relation to those two

155
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,100
things is known as your security posture

156
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,740
and this is often achieved through via

157
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,539
threat modeling vulnerability Management

158
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:26,820
Programs security testing pen testing

159
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,860
red teaming it is to essentially

160
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,720
ascertain the Gap in your defenses

161
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,039
within those gaps this is when you're

162
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,560
gonna look to put in place protective

163
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,259
controls or preventative controls so

164
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:42,000
that is about how you protect yourself

165
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,820
against those threats and protection is

166
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,560
a great place to start when it comes to

167
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,060
cyber security although as we all know

168
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,460
it's not the place that you finish there

169
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,380
is a whole bunch of different types of

170
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,360
protective tools defined there and

171
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,220
protection also comes in the form of

172
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,039
course in people and process as well as

173
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,080
the technologies that they use so

174
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,600
there's an absolute huge amount and

175
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,280
massive industry behind protective

176
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,220
controls and they're all very important

177
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,440
so then we've prepared ourselves what's

178
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,960
next well we then want to detect so we

179
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,180
know that our protections are never

180
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,759
gonna withstand all attackers all the

181
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,800
time and this is why it's so important

182
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,080
to detect threats so we start this by

183
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,240
being threat-led in our mental models so

184
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,340
this is thinking like an adversary and

185
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,160
this is can be assisted by the

186
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,780
definition of a purple team which is

187
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,699
essentially a nice interplay between

188
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:34,800
those that are defending and those that

189
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,419
spend most of their time thinking like

190
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:38,639
attackers I.E pen testers red teamers

191
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,680
and we need to play between them and the

192
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,479
cross-functional teams often refer to as

193
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,100
a purple team

194
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,319
so you're already threat-led you now

195
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,479
need to develop what I would refer to as

196
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,100
detections in depth so you don't just

197
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,419
want one detection you don't just want

198
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:53,880
the security camera or a laser you want

199
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,220
something that is going to detect across

200
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,080
all the different parts of your attack

201
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,940
surface all the different layers of your

202
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,440
organization

203
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,479
um and it's digital footprint so you're

204
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:04,500
going to have to do this through

205
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,539
detection engineering which is when you

206
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:08,880
essentially specify the threat to people

207
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,440
trying to protect and specify the

208
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,880
control you're looking to put into place

209
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,979
and you're going to do that the approach

210
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:16,199
typing if you're a mature organization

211
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,520
you're hopefully applying some form of

212
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,139
software development life cycle to do

213
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:20,940
textual engineering and this is going to

214
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,580
require access to data I.E Telemetry

215
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,199
from your endpoints from your network

216
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,759
from your cloud from other security

217
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:29,759
tools and and indeed as many places as

218
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:30,660
possible

219
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,580
you're going to then deploy and test

220
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,199
those detections so you're going to

221
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,240
hopefully leverage devops practices like

222
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,740
continuous integration continuous

223
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,900
deployment you can hopefully deploy

224
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,699
things like unit testing and automatic

225
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:43,979
deployment of your detections in a life

226
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:46,560
cycle that's very easy to maintain and

227
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,539
then comes the important part in many

228
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:49,860
ways which is the monitoring and

229
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,380
investigation so you've now got your

230
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,960
detections and they fire alerts or cases

231
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,539
they need to be triaged contextualized

232
00:07:57,539 --> 00:07:59,880
and investigated so your triaging is

233
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,160
often is this actually a perceivable

234
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,080
threat or is it possibly a false

235
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,720
positive or a benign positive

236
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,460
you're going to then try and provide

237
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,740
contextualization so you might have a

238
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,960
user ID but who is the actual user who's

239
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,400
their line manager what's their job

240
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,099
whether it's an asset like a computer or

241
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:19,440
a cloud asset what is it used for who

242
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,300
owns it what software is running on it

243
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,280
that is all providing context to your

244
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,440
investigation which enables you to do

245
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,620
determination so determination is all

246
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,300
about confidence and there's multiple

247
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,800
approaches to confidence but

248
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,080
fundamentally you're trying to ascertain

249
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,539
whether it's an actual threat or not and

250
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,159
when you and if you identify either

251
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,760
threat what is the perceived impact

252
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,440
um this is then when we of course move

253
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,680
into response so first and foremost

254
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,420
before hopefully you've detected a

255
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,920
threat you've done that preparation that

256
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,839
you talked about and an instant response

257
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,339
there are very specific types of

258
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:55,019
preparation are very important so

259
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:57,180
there's your policies and processes your

260
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,740
guidelines playbooks are essentially

261
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,899
your documentation and your training but

262
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:02,700
then there's your proof of that training

263
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,019
your testing on it so that's done

264
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:06,240
through tabletop exercises role plays

265
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,640
incident tests where you essentially try

266
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,260
and make sure that you're ready to

267
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,600
respond in ways that you think in the

268
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,580
actual instant management process you're

269
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,200
first of all going to do

270
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,839
um identification so incident validation

271
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:20,580
essentially so somebody possibly

272
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,680
yourself has suspected there's a threat

273
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,019
that happens in detection but you want

274
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:26,640
to validate like you don't just want to

275
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,019
trust that everyone's done their job you

276
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:29,580
want to make sure that both the tools

277
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,440
and the people involved have truly

278
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,600
understood what it is the technology and

279
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,240
people are telling them your analysis is

280
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,220
to try and understand the broader impact

281
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,440
to your organization and this is often

282
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,300
looking at the depth and breadth of the

283
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,040
compromise the stage of the attack phase

284
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,440
or kill chain that the attacker might be

285
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,180
in and you should of course be

286
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,380
documenting everything as that's

287
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,360
critical to both Lessons Learned and

288
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,620
hopefully understanding the root cause

289
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,120
of the incident

290
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,339
you then move to the stage which is you

291
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:59,040
know collectively called get out I.E you

292
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,660
believe someone's dropped in how do you

293
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,279
get them out and that is containment and

294
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:04,560
eradication so you're hopefully going to

295
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,060
prepare playbooks where there's a

296
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,279
malware event or a ransomware event or a

297
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:10,140
defacement of your website that you have

298
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,060
common playbooks that help keep you on

299
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,440
track you're never going to cover every

300
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,480
eventuality but if you can cover the

301
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,519
basics it's going to help keep you on on

302
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,500
task especially when you might be

303
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,000
fatigued or in distress

304
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,680
you're often going to have instant

305
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,180
commanders or managers that are going to

306
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,279
help you coordinate and make sure that

307
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:27,420
you're doing the right things at the

308
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,920
right time and the right people are

309
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,860
informed and you may well be liaising

310
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,740
with legal support the police and

311
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,180
therefore in some cases you are going to

312
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,800
be asked to prioritize evidence

313
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,540
collection for legal proceedings or

314
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,300
indeed possibly even for arrests and

315
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,220
police investigations

316
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,959
the final stage is recovery but we're

317
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:47,880
about to cover that shortly so now think

318
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,320
about the end of an incident you've

319
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,760
recovered the business you've contained

320
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,399
and gone out the adversary the Lessons

321
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,260
Learned is really important so no one is

322
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,060
ever going to do things perfect all the

323
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,220
time and so the key thing to do is look

324
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,899
at what went wrong look over what you've

325
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:03,060
documented think back to when you were

326
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,220
perhaps emotional and make mistakes or

327
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,360
when you're overwhelmed and made

328
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,640
mistakes document all that down and

329
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,380
improve all of those things and prepare

330
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,300
for the next time where hopefully you'll

331
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,220
do an even better job

332
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,800
so moving to the fourth and thing and I

333
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,600
think in a lot of ways the ultimate

334
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,640
outcome that security operations is

335
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,740
there to deliver and that is recovering

336
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,779
the business so recovering its operation

337
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:27,959
or business as usual so all that's come

338
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:29,339
before this might be the most

339
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:31,500
interesting part of security operations

340
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,660
or being in the blue team but what the

341
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,100
business cares most about is business

342
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,899
continuity and ensuring that the

343
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:39,000
business is able to operate

344
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,940
um hopefully even despite an attack

345
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,820
so first and foremost again preparation

346
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,980
so you know inserting the circumstances

347
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,420
how would the business survive that's

348
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,760
often called continuity planning that is

349
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,079
often something that will not be the

350
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,240
sole responsibility of security but

351
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,339
Security will be an active stakeholder

352
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:59,040
and operator within that process so

353
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,000
alignment within the business

354
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,860
stakeholders and the overall it

355
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,260
functions will be key

356
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,880
um your role was to be coordination

357
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,680
support So recovering the actual

358
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,839
business is rarely going to be your

359
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,360
primary responsibility you will be doing

360
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,579
the threat side of it whereas it's often

361
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:16,079
another business professional the

362
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,220
writing professionals what we're dealing

363
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,440
with the continuity compartment so do

364
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,360
bear in mind that cyber cyber security

365
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,700
threats adversaries are rarely going to

366
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,380
be the most important consideration to

367
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,540
the business they're going to be in some

368
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,339
cases thinking existentially about the

369
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:31,500
business's survival in some industries

370
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,839
that may include people's lives and

371
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,300
people's jobs so think about your role

372
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,620
and your priorities within that

373
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,779
situation and how you can be the you

374
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:41,940
know the best possible supporter and all

375
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,519
and and coordinator to support you know

376
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:46,380
the ultimate goals of the business

377
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,959
the one of the most important metrics in

378
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,240
the mean time to recovery so ultimately

379
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,480
how long from business Interruption I.E

380
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,459
business cannot do

381
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:58,740
um its operation in a normal way to the

382
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,660
point it can continue operation that is

383
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,220
your meantime to recovery and there's a

384
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,139
common metric that businesses will use

385
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:06,360
to measure the success of their overall

386
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,820
business continuity program

387
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,220
so they are the main areas of what the

388
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,260
blue team do so now let's talk about the

389
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,060
people that often work in the blue teams

390
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,000
and I'm going to focus primarily on uh

391
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,680
some career advice here and then talk

392
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,959
about some of the common roles so first

393
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:23,940
and foremost career advice should always

394
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,800
be listened to with a massive pinch of

395
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,779
salt from anybody and anyone that tells

396
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:29,880
you you should do X should be

397
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,980
interrogated very carefully to make sure

398
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,779
that they're not leading you on a path

399
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:35,399
that's full of their own personal bias

400
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,560
so there's never One path to success

401
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,260
that is an incredibly diverse industry

402
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,360
we work in and there are many paths if

403
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,959
not almost in limited bets to success

404
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:48,779
um don't think and indeed don't go down

405
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:50,880
the wrong pass in particular though and

406
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,560
that is don't assume path is technical

407
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,720
don't believe your current skill set

408
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,399
will be the future skill set needed by

409
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,440
the industry and by businesses

410
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,579
um definitely don't assume other people

411
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:01,320
should follow the way you did it they're

412
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,420
not you you're not them and your lives

413
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,680
are very different and often will

414
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,899
diverge in many places

415
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:08,459
um don't assume that if you are

416
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:09,779
technical all that they're the only

417
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:12,180
skills you need we live again in a in

418
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,380
Crossville in a world where

419
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,240
cross-functional working and teams and

420
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,680
all kinds of other skills are required

421
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,700
but I'll get to some of those things

422
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,339
later and just basically don't assume

423
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:22,980
anything you know be hungry be

424
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,779
um ask questions try and learn things

425
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:26,399
describe something and if it doesn't

426
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,160
work out try something else

427
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,660
um if I could give you some advice it

428
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,700
would be you know be kind first and

429
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,800
fundamentally in almost everything you

430
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,380
do whenever possible uh be hungry so be

431
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,639
hungry for knowledge be hungry for

432
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,860
experiences and go after them and ask

433
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,180
questions and you know break things

434
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:45,600
although ideally in safe ways

435
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,420
um the reality of a career is that yeah

436
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,060
you have taken a certain path so far and

437
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,800
that is a fixed path even though you had

438
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,260
other options but the future

439
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,120
um is essentially almost Limitless

440
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,980
depending on the choices you make so

441
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,260
regardless of your successes and

442
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,480
regardless of your challenges or your

443
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,339
failures there in the past and there's

444
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:06,779
nothing you can do about them all you

445
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:09,420
can do is choose the the paths and the

446
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,339
pain you're willing to suffer for the

447
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:12,660
pursuit of what it is that you want out

448
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,980
of life

449
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,860
so common entry roles within blue teams

450
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,480
these are the ones that I've had the

451
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,160
most experience in hiring for and seen

452
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,560
as as kind of Entry roles within the

453
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,060
blue teams and it very much depends on

454
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,800
your experience and your your skill set

455
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,839
but you've got the security analyst or

456
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,100
sort of some type of referred to as the

457
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,079
security operator they're going to be

458
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:32,699
responsible for a lot of that detect

459
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:34,860
phase that we talked about so

460
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,260
um doing a triaging of security alerts

461
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,120
or observations doing some of the

462
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,339
investigation they might recommend next

463
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:43,320
steps they'll hopefully support any

464
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,600
active incidents they might be involved

465
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,000
in preparing report writing research and

466
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,860
indeed proactive detection which is

467
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,079
threat hunting so when you don't know

468
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,399
there's something out there nothing's

469
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:55,260
alerted you to it but you go and you

470
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,880
interrogate your logs you interrogate

471
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,519
your systems to try and find activity of

472
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,139
threats

473
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:02,399
um there is an overlap with a security

474
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,260
engineer although an engineer will often

475
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,959
have more of a coding background not

476
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,060
necessarily an expert developer but will

477
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,040
be familiar with scripting and

478
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,380
configuring systems in complex ways so

479
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,120
they're often going be responsible for

480
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,579
building detections within the various

481
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:19,260
security tools at your disposal they

482
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,000
might be involved in automating some of

483
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,040
those systems and designing the overall

484
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,320
Security Solutions that you're trying to

485
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,899
put in place they may indeed contribute

486
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:29,579
to security architecture within the

487
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:32,160
spiritual operations team or wider teams

488
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,380
and they're definitely in most cases

489
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,120
going to be involved in installing or

490
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,000
configuring security software seams edrs

491
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,339
ndrs antivirus you know there's all

492
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:42,839
different tools they may involve get

493
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:44,519
involved in and similarly security

494
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:46,199
analysts they're also often going to

495
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:48,839
involve themselves in threat research

496
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,279
but these are certainly not the

497
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:51,540
immatures and I'm not going to go

498
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,180
through all of these I would recommend

499
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,560
digitalworld.net which is a great uh

500
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,839
tool developed by their skills

501
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,519
development in Scotland

502
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,839
um that talks about some of the careers

503
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:02,279
there's many resources like these online

504
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:04,380
and I recommend everyone that is

505
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,059
interested in careers inside that goes

506
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,559
and have a look you'll notice that

507
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,660
several of these are are not deeply

508
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,240
technical like Risk advisor for example

509
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,040
um or auditor there are many rules for

510
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,959
many different types of people so please

511
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:18,179
do have a look

512
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:20,939
uh so um getting down to the final

513
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,619
section of this presentation it's going

514
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:24,179
to be around competency so I'm going to

515
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:25,919
share with you some of what I believe

516
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,559
are are much needed Technical and very

517
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,780
behavioral competencies within cyber

518
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,460
security especially within the blue team

519
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,320
and some people might call these hard

520
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,780
and soft skills and I prefer to use more

521
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,520
descriptive language like Technical and

522
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,020
behavioral because I think hard and soft

523
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,780
can often be seen as one's primary one

524
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,640
secondary and I don't believe that's the

525
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,860
case whatsoever and you can be deeply

526
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,940
technical but without the right

527
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,919
behaviors it's unlikely if you have a

528
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,440
successful career and vice versa

529
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,240
um you know you might be an excellent

530
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,740
communicator but you still have to have

531
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,020
the technical skills to do your job and

532
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,400
in this context technical doesn't

533
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,380
necessarily mean technical as in

534
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,299
technology it could just mean that you

535
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:05,280
know if your job is to be a designer

536
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,080
your technical skills might be operating

537
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,960
your design tools for example

538
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,760
so here's some of the foundational

539
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,580
competencies that I believe are um very

540
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,020
important for those working with inside

541
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,760
security especially within the blue team

542
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,440
so networking principles and

543
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,299
understanding how networks work doesn't

544
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:22,679
mean you need to be networking engineer

545
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:24,120
but understanding some of the basics

546
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,160
will be very advantageous and many

547
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,400
threats are detected within the network

548
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,179
understanding Network protection

549
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:32,580
Technologies firewalls proxies Etc and

550
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,260
understanding how they work are is

551
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,580
advantageous it really helps you

552
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,679
understand what might have gotten in the

553
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,660
way of an attack or indeed setting up a

554
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,880
new system operating systems and

555
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,280
endpoints so your standard Windows Linux

556
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,260
Mac how they're used how they might be

557
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,960
administered the ability to use basic

558
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,640
command line tools can be very useful

559
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,380
especially when triaging problems and

560
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,140
trying to set up systems and indeed um

561
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,880
physical versus virtualized the

562
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,919
difference between you know a bare metal

563
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:00,419
device

564
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:01,559
um or indeed something that's

565
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:03,120
virtualized whether that is on a

566
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,220
traditional virtual machine or whether

567
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,140
that's in a container or indeed

568
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,820
serverless or function as a service type

569
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,260
software

570
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,880
on the other side is then more

571
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,260
comprehension around the threats that

572
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,179
are out there so what is malware what

573
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:17,160
types of families exist what are some of

574
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,539
the research research tools at your

575
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:21,539
disposal like virus total or cooking

576
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:23,400
um internal versus external threats

577
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,320
there are of course both

578
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,120
um and indeed the basics of application

579
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,580
security with OAS top 20 being a great

580
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,840
resource to learn some of that

581
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,360
information an awareness Frameworks

582
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,919
again not being an expert but just

583
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:36,299
understanding what they are and how

584
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:37,980
they're used so the nists have security

585
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,679
framework the CIS critical security

586
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,720
controls is a great resource to see how

587
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,980
to harden

588
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:47,160
um the most common types of uses for

589
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,980
computers and the uh is brilliant and

590
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,500
indeed ISO 27000 and one is a useful

591
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,059
thing to have awareness of and as it's

592
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,460
PCI DSS

593
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,140
um again an awareness of software

594
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,220
development so not being a a programmer

595
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,900
but something is very useful in

596
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,940
scripting whether that's in bash and

597
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,559
shell whether that's in actual programs

598
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:11,039
like python or golang being aware of the

599
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,600
um secure software development life

600
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,520
cycle and where the handoffs might be

601
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,799
and indeed application spheres testing

602
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,840
so static and dynamic security testing

603
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,220
and finally a little awareness of

604
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,260
databases goes a long way like SQL and

605
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,299
lsql types

606
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:27,480
some emerging areas which I think uh

607
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,919
some are more emerging than others some

608
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:30,840
are actually now more foundational than

609
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,520
they used to be would certainly be an

610
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,320
awareness of cloud technology so the

611
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,880
public cloud and tools like you know

612
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,240
Amazon web services Google gcp

613
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,520
Etc and Edge Computing

614
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,260
um like cloudflare or the edge Computing

615
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,000
offered by the previously mentioned

616
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,860
public Cloud vendors the difference

617
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,780
between software as a service platform

618
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,460
as a service

619
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,160
um infrastructure as a service Etc

620
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,559
and then again moving into more like the

621
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:56,760
container World a container management

622
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,820
world and with Docker kubernetes Etc and

623
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,559
function as a service like Lambda being

624
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,360
again things to have a good awareness of

625
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,220
and the differences and the types of

626
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,220
security differences between them or or

627
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:10,020
emerging and advantageous advantageous

628
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,640
knowledge sets because there are now

629
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,620
many companies that are essentially

630
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,539
Cloud first where you know they simply

631
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:18,179
do not have you know a traditional Edge

632
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:20,039
they do not have endpoints in the way

633
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:21,600
you might think of them and

634
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,299
understanding the differences I think is

635
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:25,679
very important

636
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,080
and a knowledge of Big Data tools so

637
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,419
when that search and analytic tools or

638
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:32,940
scenes like elastic Hadoop Splunk humia

639
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,460
uh string processing so like Kafka

640
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,919
Pulsar rather mq and a message queue

641
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,080
that could be leveraged for detection of

642
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,220
threats

643
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,659
um and then visualization tools as well

644
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:45,600
like Curious Cabana near Dash and some

645
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,039
of the search and scene ones have these

646
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,960
built in as well so that can be useful

647
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,520
for report writing or trying to

648
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,980
visualize things in a way that's more uh

649
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,600
appropriate for people that are packed

650
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,059
not as technical

651
00:21:57,059 --> 00:21:59,580
um Frameworks that leverage uh miter

652
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,500
attack and the kill chain environment

653
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,659
ages attack in particular is an

654
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:05,520
incredible resource and knowledge

655
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,159
repository and ontology that essentially

656
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:09,720
tries to represent

657
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,240
um threats actors or adversaries and the

658
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,620
relationship between them and what they

659
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,059
try and Achieve through their tactics

660
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:17,580
and techniques and it's constantly being

661
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,200
updated it's got an incredible team

662
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,419
behind it and I highly recommend anyone

663
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:23,700
who doesn't know how to use it and using

664
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,520
it more and defensive tax incent and

665
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,860
techniques are important so might to

666
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,419
defend which is a relatively new project

667
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:32,760
which I think is still in beta it's very

668
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,679
useful and it's mapped against attack

669
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:36,179
for understanding the counter measures

670
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:37,860
or security controls you might put in

671
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,020
place there's motor engagements is a

672
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,220
really interesting model as well which

673
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,020
is more like engaging with the adversary

674
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,280
and what you might be able to do to

675
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,740
disrupt an active attack

676
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,419
and then you've got the hunting maturity

677
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:50,100
model you've got the sigma library of

678
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,200
detections and open source intelligence

679
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,120
all of these things are fantastic tools

680
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,120
for um defensive teams for the blue team

681
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,000
and finally devops practices so you know

682
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,980
devops is essentially the vehicle in

683
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,720
which modern software is developed and

684
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,120
released and understanding how they work

685
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,520
and how that works on a continuous basis

686
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,679
is very important for for Modern Blue

687
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:12,720
teamers because these are ultimately

688
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,059
going to be the people uh deploying

689
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:17,159
software software that is sometimes

690
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:18,480
going to be vulnerable and if they're

691
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,159
deploying it very rapidly how you can

692
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,480
interact with them and how you can help

693
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,700
them establish guardrails to secure

694
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,220
themselves is very important

695
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,780
so now we're talking about technical

696
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,179
let's talk about behavioral and these

697
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:32,640
are six behaviors or behavioral areas

698
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,159
that I think are very important and you

699
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:36,539
know these are not things you can like

700
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:38,400
tick off whereas I'll get done I've

701
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,140
completed that but they are things to

702
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,360
keep in mind and often through you know

703
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,100
using that first one of self-awareness

704
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,080
is the ability to

705
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,059
um be aware of your own emotions where

706
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,039
where strength your strengths lie and

707
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:52,020
and where your weaknesses might lie and

708
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,179
where you might have impact on others so

709
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:56,039
with your self-awareness the others can

710
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:57,780
then follow a little bit easier so

711
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,000
self-regulation so wisely managing your

712
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,559
emotions especially around other people

713
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:04,020
okay especially at work and making sure

714
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,360
appropriate boundaries are in place

715
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,179
um showing empathy I think is absolutely

716
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:10,799
underrated

717
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,720
um unfortunately improving but you know

718
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,100
the ability to identify and understand

719
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,380
other people's emotions and show them

720
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,320
compassion uh motivation so you know the

721
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,940
ability to

722
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:23,220
um recognize what motivates you when

723
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,780
you're unmotivated what can you do to

724
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,700
change that when you need to bring

725
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,919
Etc your social skills so managing

726
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:30,840
relationships to the benefit of everyone

727
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,780
not just yourself and finally that you

728
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,120
find to Foster belonging so that can be

729
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,280
in just simply the way you treat your

730
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,720
colleagues but if you're a manager if

731
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,220
you're a leader then that comes more

732
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,140
down to how you how you Foster a culture

733
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,419
of belonging through being you know in

734
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:48,419
being inclusive showing kindness and you

735
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:50,340
know making sure that you you're aware

736
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,679
of differences or beliefs that might

737
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:55,080
influence their behavior and being you

738
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,340
know empathetic and kind to them

739
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,559
throughout

740
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,240
um right so I think that's me there's a

741
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,559
