18
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,300
first time I did this talk I had my

19
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,860
seven-year-old child but apparently she

20
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,540

21
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,280
she's not here but anyway girl's my new

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,120
child

23
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,760
is that okay it's been well mate good so

24
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,559
attribution is

25
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,000
[ __ ]

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,440
um changed my mind

27
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,020
so I'm Sam Humphries

28
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,239
let's do a little who is Sam I didn't

29
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,559
bring my blanket today those of you who

30
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:03,120
are John McAfee blanket fans he's in my

31
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,379
hotel room

32
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,720
um these are these are all true

33
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,299
um X Bean pay me definitely I don't even

34
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:10,680
know if I've recovered as an imposter

35
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,220
I'm just an imposter uh I can DJ I don't

36
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,640
have my child John McAfee is life

37
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,680
um I met Jensen Barton earlier sorry

38
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,020
it's very I did some button met me that

39
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,280
was fun

40
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,560
um no licorice no polystyrene and if you

41
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,820
like coming to the north in the cold

42
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,180
come to besides Newcastle it's the best

43
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,299
so promises promises promises this is

44
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:34,560
something about what I said I would talk

45
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,880
about

46
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,619
um like I say there will be some bad

47
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:38,780
words

48
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,979
maybe attribution is

49
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:44,220
holy [ __ ] maybe it's not we will see

50
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,259
um we're going to talk about why threat

51
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:49,680
intelligence is really important

52
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,659
um where attribution Works where it

53
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,340
really doesn't where it can cause you a

54
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,960
lot of problems and if it's something

55
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,460
you're interested in how do you get into

56
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,740
it who can you give money to to help

57
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,180
learn things what can you get for free

58
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,280
because we like free and if you've got

59
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,140
questions please do like stick your hand

60
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,000
up and somebody will run at you with a

61
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,500
handheld microphone

62
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,800
okay well good Anna cowbell and not a

63
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,879
clicker

64
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:14,359
so

65
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,819
this talk started life

66
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:21,500
um because of this tweet

67
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,360
it was a bit of a flippant moment

68
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,640
I do mostly think that attribution is

69
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,300
[ __ ] not gonna lie thank you but

70
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,560
um someone came back to me and they said

71
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,940
is there any way I can convince you not

72
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,680
and there is one answer to this question

73
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,840
in one answer only and that answer is

74
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,760
cake

75
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,140
now

76
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,900
no cake was provided so I stand by my

77
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,879
original sentiment thank you for coming

78
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,260
to my talk

79
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,459
um no

80
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:48,720
so let's talk about how to do

81
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,660
attribution ultimately the best thing to

82
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,700
do Ian are you listening

83
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,319
is blame Canada

84
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:57,900
excellent oh just play me in frankly

85
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,000
it's probably somewhere down the line

86
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,540
but in which case let's play in Canada

87
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,280
or let's take credit for everything

88
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,519
because that's fine too

89
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:10,500
um I love I love Anonymous I love what

90
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,420
they do as far as everyone can be

91
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,980
anonymous and say they did stuff even if

92
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,720
they didn't doesn't matter

93
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,700
um maybe not the best idea either even

94
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,140
though we're all Anonymous maybe we

95
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,239
don't want to be who knows

96
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:22,739
side

97
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:26,400
why do we do attribution well

98
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,620
here's where it goes wrong ultimately we

99
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,239
like to have something or someone to

100
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,180
blame because then it's not our fault

101
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,060
someone else's fault

102
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,959
the challenge that we have with

103
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,200
attribution is that we'll tend to go

104
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,500
down a path that suits our narrative

105
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,760
it's easy

106
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,500
we'll come up with a hypothesis we'll

107
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,379
chase that dream all the way

108
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:51,959
um but we have biases the amount of

109
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:53,760
times I've heard someone go huh it was

110
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,440
Russia

111
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,560
um it's lazy frankly but there are times

112
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,480
when attribution can be good we do have

113
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,280
issues with it as humans because we just

114
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,720
want to blame somebody and we're very

115
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,400
biased and we don't really want to look

116
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,200
into things and sometimes it's useful

117
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,720
sometimes it's not great great article

118
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,040
here

119
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,299
um slides if you want them at the end

120
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:13,739
you can have a look

121
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:17,160
that was how burgles thoughts on things

122
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,320
um a few more thoughts from the internet

123
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,540
Sun Tzu not the actual sunsey who's not

124
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,680
on Twitter

125
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,560
um but suddenly the art of cyber warfare

126
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,820
um seems to be in some level of

127
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,979
agreement with me so that's good

128
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:31,919
uh anyone here big fan of dice with more

129
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,660
than six sides

130
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,460
Ian yeah

131
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,000
um I'm not my husband is it's um I can't

132
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,040
cope with them but you know that is a

133
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,259
way of attribution for sure

134
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:45,960
and let's do some research

135
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,740
I got 15 votes from people

136
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,240
um on LinkedIn so this is actual

137
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,740
research but we had to stop it here

138
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,660
because if you if you can squint when we

139
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,759
got to LIT Impressions that's the end of

140
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:59,460
any good research is every full no

141
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,220
um so mix mixed emotions from the 15

142
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,259
people who bothered to reply so maybe

143
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:08,419
let's not write an entire thesis on that

144
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,979
so back to being humans and my

145
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:12,540
attribution isn't great

146
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,100
um we'll even go as far as accepting

147
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,040
falsehoods if it goes with our hot take

148
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,320
the internet is Rife with such things

149
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,479
and and we love it so it's really come

150
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:25,199
no worries I need the cowbell just yet

151
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,699
the attribution isn't just a cyber

152
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:28,320
problem

153
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,360
this is from a museum in fact the Gettys

154
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,180
Museum in Los Angeles and was attributed

155
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,560
for about

156
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,660
20 30 years at least whilst it was

157
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,479
touring big art museums of the world as

158
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:41,580
being a gal gown statue

159
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,740
and eventually after being in the Getty

160
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,220
for quite a long time somebody went hmm

161
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,020
I don't know if it is a girl gun you

162
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,280
know

163
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,020
you should have a look at it

164
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,840
they decided the plinth was wrong

165
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,000
it's always a good way to spot I find

166
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,520
and also it wasn't signed

167
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,620
so it transpires anyway this is not a

168
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,419
gal gun galgan did some paintings of

169
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:04,800
this statue

170
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,440
uh he did a small tour of Polynesia and

171
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,940
out in the in the sticks in the Pacific

172
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,820
all our early places and a friend of his

173
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,940
sent him a photo of this from one of the

174
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,220
islands out that way two years before he

175
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,720
went there

176
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,479
so turns out it's not a galgan and is

177
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:22,800
now sat in a Cupboard somewhere where

178
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,120
somebody tries to figure out who the

179
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,560
hell did make it

180
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,199
so it's not just a cyber problem very

181
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,060
smart people at museums with lots of

182
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,680
research skills can also get it wrong

183
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,360
because of the reasons that we talked

184
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,100
about before I've seen the picture they

185
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,780
thought brilliant girl guns well into

186
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,180
this guy must have been him turns out no

187
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,919
so don't feel bad if you've ever

188
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:42,120
attributed something and got it wrong

189
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,479
museums do it too

190
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:47,220
um moving on just duck down so you get

191
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,919
the full anyone know Louise honey

192
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,380
no she's not dead I went to school with

193
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,419
Louise honey I don't think she's here

194
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:56,160
um I did not poison Louise honey this is

195
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,080
another big case of bad attribution and

196
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,520
actually bad facts

197
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,240
you look terrified didn't poison her

198
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,160
um it's a bit of a sad story does anyone

199
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,780
remember stop and grow for biting your

200
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,580
fingernails

201
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,620
yes thank you

202
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,180
um no I'm not afraid to say I sucked my

203
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,919
thumb till I was eight

204
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,419
and then I had some stop and grow and I

205
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:17,819
stopped and then my nail grew not did

206
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:18,780
stopped

207
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,220
um a dear friend of mine decided they'd

208
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,139
be hilarious if we painted a bit of stop

209
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:23,759
and grow onto Louise Honey's Tupperware

210
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,599
cup

211
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:27,419
and as we were doing that it's non-toxic

212
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:30,060
she grabbed my hand and went and tipped

213
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,500
it all in and then ran off to Louise

214
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,240
honey and said Sam Sam tried to poison

215
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,800
you

216
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,419
who does that

217
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:39,180
who does that Amy kalis is who does that

218
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,039
I'm telling you so I got hauled in front

219
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,900
of the Headmaster and the deputy had

220
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,819
mistress for poisoning somebody and

221
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:46,199
nearly got thrown out of school but I

222
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,539
didn't poison them so not only bad fats

223
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:50,400
wasn't even me so there we go

224
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,639
attribution is terrible changed my mind

225
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,139
right new game pretend you're a

226
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:57,319
government

227
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,960
everyone good governments aren't very

228
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,759
good attribution either

229
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,620
so um being a government I don't want to

230
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,180
be a government

231
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,860
you all just lost the game so there we

232
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,880
go

233
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,819
this is this is a sad story and I think

234
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:13,319
a serious story not the Louise Honey

235
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:15,060
Thing

236
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,000
um even governments and agencies with

237
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,440
lots of letters in the name they can

238
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,660
take ages to attribute too

239
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,720
this gentleman was 96 when he finally

240
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,300
got hauled off to prison for World War

241
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,160
II crimes

242
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,159
so that was quite a long time ago

243
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,799
and it took him until I think last year

244
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,599
before they finally had this guy in

245
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,219
court and hold him off to prison

246
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:40,140
and they've got generally a lot more

247
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,240
access to people information computers

248
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,399
and stuff than I slowly folks in cyber

249
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,920
security have so again don't feel bad it

250
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,140
can take time

251
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,260
The Anthem breach which a dear friend of

252
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,180
mine Steve Moore was was heading up the

253
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,620
response to that

254
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,140
again it took years for them to try and

255
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,200
figure out who may well have hacked them

256
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,500
they believe now it was China

257
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,940
um some of those quick to attribute

258
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,200
people could have run and told them that

259
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,060
on day one but actually they needed to

260
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,560
look into it a bit more

261
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,240
um they've now tried to extradite couple

262
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,220
of Chinese hackers for the attack on

263
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,339
their systems this is still ongoing

264
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:19,560
so

265
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,360
this was I think seven eight years ago

266
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,920
they're still trying to figure out who

267
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,279
it was

268
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,180
and this was Steve thoughts on the

269
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,500
matter and given he headed up this thing

270
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,360
and was very very much responsible for

271
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,740
the response

272
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,839
even when you're working on the

273
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,700
attribution piece which arguably you

274
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,839
shouldn't be doing in the middle of a

275
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:38,160
response anyway

276
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,959
we've still got

277
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:41,160
um we should still question these things

278
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,140
if you come up with your hypothesis you

279
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,000
know we peer review stuff in science and

280
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,200
we're doing attribution we should

281
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,760
certainly have a bunch of people look at

282
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,580
the methodology the thought process the

283
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,440
biases on whether it's worth doing in

284
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,860
the first place

285
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:59,399
okay so attribution may or may not be

286
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,320
oh [ __ ] thank you

287
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,200
um we haven't changed my mind yet

288
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,700
um threat Intelligence on the other hand

289
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,320
really useful there was a whole bunch of

290
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,940
threat and tell folks in this room right

291
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,380
now those people who've got threat

292
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,180
Intelligence coming into their their

293
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,519
Solutions thank you I didn't say vendors

294
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,660
um and some of you may be responsible

295
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,040
for curating threat intelligence

296
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,720
yourselves

297
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,399
some of it can be good

298
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,440
some of it can be incredibly useful

299
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,620
some of it can be again dangerous but

300
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,300
I'd say throughout intelligence is way

301
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,680
more valuable than attribution for the

302
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,240
most part

303
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,459
this is what it's good for in my humble

304
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:36,420
opinion

305
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,580
it's good for talking to senior people

306
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,820
about what the problems are likely to be

307
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,360
so how frequently are we attacked

308
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,060
how easily can we be attacked

309
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,980
and what do we have that's of Interest

310
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,680
what's happening in our vertical these

311
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,880
types of questions to help them

312
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,680
understand why we need more budget in

313
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,959
cyber security threat intelligence is

314
00:10:57,959 --> 00:10:59,459
there to help you as whether as well as

315
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,620
to drive your programs your processes

316
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,540
and your thoughts around what you should

317
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,100
be focusing on

318
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,500
good threat intelligence hooray we like

319
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,660
that

320
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,399
times when you shouldn't be embarking on

321
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:12,899
your threat intelligent program include

322
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:15,540
when you're in the middle of an incident

323
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,339
um that's not the time to go oh God I

324
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:18,720
wish we'd had some threat and soul going

325
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,760
on let's get on with implementing this

326
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,200
right now don't Implement anything in

327
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,760
the middle of an incident really unless

328
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,380
your instant Response Team tells you to

329
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,120
and it shouldn't be this

330
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,459
but if you are looking at implementing a

331
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:31,079
threat intelligence program or cyber

332
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:32,399
threat intelligence program for the

333
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,860
purposes of three-letter acronyms

334
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,140
um these things are super important like

335
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,700
most projects we would do in cyber

336
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,800
security you would think right why are

337
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,300
we doing it how are we going to measure

338
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,579
it what's the point

339
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,500
um who are we going to tell around it

340
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,839
what reporting do we need and is that

341
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:50,579
going to actually be useful rather than

342
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:52,320
counting some beans because that's

343
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,180
always a favorite

344
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,279
um who is going to read the reports that

345
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:57,899
we send

346
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:00,060
because I think that's a trap we all

347
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,380
fall into as we start reporting on

348
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,420
something in cyber we send it up the

349
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,060
chain and we just keep sending them and

350
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,320
we never check to see if anyone's

351
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,060
actually reading this stuff

352
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,920
so communication communication

353
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,959
communication really important ask

354
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,640
people what they're interested in rather

355
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,140
than just sending them stuff and they

356
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,779
put it in a folder or set up a rule

357
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,120
it happens

358
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,740
um so yes if we can create a bunch of

359
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,680
reports no one reads that would be

360
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,380
thank you pointless

361
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,640
okay

362
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,200
good I need to move because the meme

363
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,540
there we go let's just duck down the

364
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,420
memes are everything there we go

365
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,700
um root cause analysis root cause

366
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,180
analysis so

367
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,560
if we're looking at what do we already

368
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,540
know about our environment where are our

369
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,040
risks how do we get how do we get pwned

370
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,959
last time what did we do about it last

371
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,180
time around and what did we learn

372
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,100
these are key things also to fit into

373
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,220
your threat intelligence program

374
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:56,820
um

375
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,380
massive value of seeing what you look

376
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,360
like to the outside world massive value

377
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,040
it's all well and good looking at you're

378
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,260
inside of your ecosystem and saying oh

379
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,300
okay we've got these many assets

380
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,820
probably we think we've got these many

381
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,220
users they probably still work here most

382
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,540
of them

383
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,000
um that data is probably quite important

384
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
all those things get a grip of but

385
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,380
actually knowing what you look like from

386
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,420
the from the outside in because

387
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,060
basically if you can find it using tools

388
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,760
threat intelligence there's various bits

389
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,100
of automation you can use to do this

390
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,139
if you can find it that way then an

391
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:34,200
attacker can find it so really good to

392
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,079
look at that side but ultimately

393
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:39,060
I cannot harp on enough about the

394
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,920
benefit of when you got attacked last

395
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,360
time

396
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,800
folding that into your threat

397
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,480
intelligence program so that you can

398
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,079
learn from that and fix things

399
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:53,040
this is what threat intelligence is not

400
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,660
getting a tip

401
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,360
badly named acronym I feel maybe not the

402
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,800
right maybe the right one chucking a

403
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,839
load of feeds in it and going

404
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,060
that would be all right

405
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,040
um first hand scene mistakes being made

406
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,120
with this

407
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,160
getting very excited about being able to

408
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,420
cross-reference something that happened

409
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,160
in China

410
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,079
um and Russia at the same time because

411
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:14,279
someone had forgotten to remove some

412
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:16,680
headers from an email and thought they'd

413
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,420
discovered some brand new hacking gang

414
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,459
that was a collaboration where it turns

415
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,079
out that when they were feeding the

416
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,360
stuff in they'd forgotten to change some

417
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,820
of the headers and everything got in a

418
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,180
massive mess so let's not do that

419
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,459
this is my favorite slide of the whole

420
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:34,139
thing please laugh at the right moments

421
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:37,860
look here all right

422
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,800
um so everyone remembers want to cry

423
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,720
everyone's trying to forget Wanna Cry

424
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,420
yes good times

425
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,459
um this is Marcus who registered the

426
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:50,040
sinkhole that saved a bunch of us from

427
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,459
wannacry Mostly the Americans because he

428
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:54,720
was still tinkering around while America

429
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,579
was asleep

430
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:59,040
um the NHS obviously well known got

431
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,480
pounded by Wanna Cry as well as many

432
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,360
other organizations

433
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,800
um Marcus is tinkering away with his

434
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,880
mate registers a gangly URL and prevents

435
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,320
actually a lot of people from getting

436
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,079
hit because the malware was checking out

437
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,060
see if it could connect this URL when it

438
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,339
found it didn't run any further

439
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:20,519
great really helpful hailed as a hero

440
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,079
other stuff happened after that less

441
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,000
good but

442
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,680
did stop a lot of people from being

443
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,079
impacted but I want to cry until this

444
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,260
happened

445
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,180
let's go back I'd face sad face there we

446
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,339
go it's Mark's crying now

447
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:37,019
actual face

448
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:41,220
isps and organizations heard about this

449
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,339
weird URL and went oh from the threat

450
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:47,180
Intel the bad URL for the bad malwares

451
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,320
let's block it

452
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,240
which was the exact opposite of what you

453
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,560
were supposed to do

454
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,480
so despite the fact they know how to get

455
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,459
out of jail free card

456
00:15:56,459 --> 00:15:58,019
shot themselves straight in the foot

457
00:15:58,019 --> 00:15:59,579
because we're used to saying okay

458
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:01,500
malware connects out to these URLs

459
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,940
therefore we should block them because

460
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,399
more bad things will happen in this case

461
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:07,100
that was what he was not supposed to do

462
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,740
so bad use of threat Intel makes me want

463
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,959
to cry

464
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,480
okay back to attribution we love threat

465
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,000
Intel there's ways of doing it right

466
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,279
attribution literally goes back to this

467
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,899
I think

468
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:23,760
and security do get blamed for stuff all

469
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,959
the time that's frankly a lack of

470
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,339
investment

471
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:27,480
um despite their saying that they need

472
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,760
we need help with stuff

473
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,019
um so

474
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:32,940
what tends to happen I find during an

475
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,560
incident is that someone will come

476
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,180
running in who's probably not helped

477
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,980
with the funding of security and hasn't

478
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,259
been reading the reports and goes it was

479
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:42,560
China

480
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,820
in the middle of an incident that's

481
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,220
really unhelpful I've been literally

482
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,600
working on them when someone's come in

483
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,240
with their massive hot take as to who

484
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,880
did it and why I don't care please go

485
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,519
away you're not helping for the most

486
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:59,040
part unless we're a government and

487
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,060
frankly we should have thought about

488
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,100
this before

489
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,939
if you're it's just a normal person

490
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:07,740
um working on an incident who did it is

491
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,599
not relevant at this point it may be

492
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,819
more relevant later down the line it may

493
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,859
not be it may screw up your cyber

494
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:15,179
insurance

495
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:16,740
top tip

496
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,880
um that's not saying you shouldn't look

497
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,240
into it but really what's going on when

498
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,799
did it happen where has it happened and

499
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,319
what do I need to do about it right now

500
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,480
is way more important than who done it

501
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,559
thank you

502
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,440
so asking the right questions at the

503
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,080
right time will help you let's not get

504
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,600
caught up in things that aren't going to

505
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,000
distract us from getting on with solving

506
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,220
a problem anyone had this happen to them

507
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,380
as well yes

508
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,100
yes China

509
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,500
pick your nation state of choice

510
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,840
um or indeed animal names with words

511
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,260
before them or apt groups all very not

512
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,660
helpful at the time has it happened to

513
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,500
you more than once yes yes it has

514
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,760
um this has made things quite

515
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,799
interesting on the attribution front

516
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,520
so thank you cyber Insurance a lot of

517
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,780
people made a lot of money up cyber

518
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,460
Insurance in in the days before

519
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,860
ransomware were really kicked in there's

520
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,120
been a lot of changes in the Cyber

521
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,580
insurance industry in the last few years

522
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,000
this got very very interesting recently

523
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,860
with not petrol and Merc were hit they

524
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,720
ended up going to court against their

525
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,299
cyber insurance company because they

526
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:28,799
said it's a nation state that's an act

527
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,120
of War

528
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,860
sorry

529
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,419
um loads of other insurances won't pay

530
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:35,160
out for other things if it's an act of

531
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,740
War why should we be any different

532
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,679
Lloyds of London have now said in August

533
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,059
that they will not pay out if it's an

534
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:43,200
apt group

535
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,900
um or a sorry nation state or an act of

536
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,740
War

537
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,419
so there's been a lot of scrabbling now

538
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:49,980
going on because cyber insurance is now

539
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,380
bloody expensive

540
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,580
um because the number of payouts that

541
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,440
have happened and insurers don't like

542
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,820
paying out they just like taking your

543
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,799
money so

544
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,720
um that is an option for you

545
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,460
maybe not the best one that doesn't mean

546
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,320
we get out of

547
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,200
investigating things horror story from

548
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,539
the early days of gdpr I mean gdpr

549
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:11,280
itself but

550
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,059
um

551
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:15,120
let's I heard from more than one CSO

552
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,980
where they had said we're actually going

553
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,900
we may not look into investigating so

554
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,100
much so that we can't be held

555
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,179
accountable

556
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:24,539
and I'm like that that's the backwards

557
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:27,600
way you can't do that you have to like

558
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,860
saying I'm not going to investigate

559
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,299
doesn't change what's happened to you

560
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:32,220
especially when it comes down to being

561
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,640
investigated by agencies now and your

562
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,440
insurance probably hates you if you've

563
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,600
even got insurance and we all saw what

564
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,980
happened in the last week with a

565
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,260
Rideshare company

566
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,600
please be a good CSO very good see so

567
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,940
mosis are lovely

568
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,400
so um it does also boil down to this

569
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,080
with attribution what is the best use of

570
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,640
your time because we will have too many

571
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,620
people in cyber security and all this

572
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,660
money lying around and we're just like

573
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,360
I've only had something to do

574
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,620
um

575
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:04,140
worrying about attribution

576
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,120
maybe isn't the best use of your time

577
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,440
there are other things that can happen

578
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,720
up front

579
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,460
if you get into a big breach scenario

580
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,980
different but sitting there saying like

581
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,840
which nation state is going to come get

582
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,280
us today

583
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,440
just because you saw some like Russian

584
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,240
code and a bit of malware doesn't mean

585
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,039
the Russian government are after you

586
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,020
it's fairly easy to um to make yourself

587
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,700
look like you're from a different

588
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,740
country to the one that you are and

589
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,360
there's been many many instances of this

590
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,100
where people have had oh look Chinese

591
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,960
characters in The malware must be the

592
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,880
Chinese because nobody else can write

593
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,440
Chinese characters apart from Chinese

594
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,740
people that's well known right

595
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,919
some of this stuff is very easy to fudge

596
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,140
okay final thoughts nearly so if you

597
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,760
want to be an attributionist real word

598
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,539
made up by Sam

599
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,480
um

600
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,340
the route of threat Intel this is

601
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,020
definitely an area where there are there

602
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,440
are open heads in threat intelling teams

603
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,240
um also including at certain Rideshare

604
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,400
companies

605
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,860
um YouTube is great maybe watch for more

606
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,900
than one video and that's not all your

607
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:07,919
training

608
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,500
Sans will teach you lots of things for

609
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,700
money

610
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,440
so that's a good place to start if

611
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,840
you've got money to do it if you're

612
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,059
earlier on in your career I mean if

613
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:18,900
you've got someone to corporately

614
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,980
sponsor you through these courses

615
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,900
they're great

616
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,940
they do also have some free stuff free

617
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,220
is good too lots of things you can

618
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,960
access here

619
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,240
um various various like sets of courses

620
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,700
which may involve a membership fee some

621
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,200
of them are free Mandy and I've actually

622
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,299
got some really good free courses

623
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:37,919
which is considering how expensive they

624
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,360
are for incident response it's nice

625
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,520
they're doing some free things

626
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,559
um great couple of websites here Katie's

627
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:45,960
five cents is awesome really good tips

628
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,520
on threat Intel

629
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,320
um Scott Roberts as well I said I'll

630
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,880
make these available somehow through the

631
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,080
beer Farmers afterwards if you're

632
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,678
looking for the links

633
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,740
so finally in summary

634
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:02,280
I still think attribution is often

635
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,260
for the reasons that I gave sometimes

636
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,340
it's useful

637
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,720
I mean yeah if you're an actual

638
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,919
government you're a polar or a cyber

639
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,120
insurance company then it's more use

640
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,900
do not just buy tip and throw threat

641
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,919
intelligence feeds on it and think

642
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,240
you're doing threat intelligence we

643
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,740
still need people to look at this stuff

644
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,179
we need people who understand our

645
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:21,299
organization our risk our business

646
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:21,900
um

647
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,880
we can't just automate the hell out of

648
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,559
this yet and just hope it works it still

649
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:27,360
needs humans but it needs to be helping

650
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,580
the humans make decisions we shouldn't

651
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,900
have somebody literally looking through

652
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:35,400
spreadsheets going they're urls

653
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,380
um don't feel bad museums get it wrong

654
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,200
too wasn't galgan nobody poisoned Louise

655
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,559
honey for the love of God no one

656
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:45,900
um choice however is an illusion and the

657
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:49,679
cake absolutely is a lie

658
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,000
um thanks for coming does anyone have a

659
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,080

662
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:05,159
no one's got a cake this is terrible

663
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:06,900

00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,960
if you know the actor and their tactics

671
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,000
I can't hear you so much louder we'll

672
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,919
just come here

673
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:30,419
oh thank you

674
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:32,220
I'll just get you in the cans Dave hi

675
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,960
hello can you hear me now I can hear you

676
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,960
now excellent so there is uh times yes

677
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,480
if you can attribute the group that's

678
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,520
attacking you you can know more about

679
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,220
their tactics stuff yes

680
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,919
but have you actually ever found that

681
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:48,659
useful

682
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:51,539
because I haven't no I find it it's the

683
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:53,039
higher-ups when they're asking things

684
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,960
like you know who is this why is it and

685
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,520
they want some sort of they want to put

686
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,840
a label on it

687
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,640
that doesn't then mean you shift your

688
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,200
entire security program so that you're

689
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,880
only looking for their tactics because

690
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,320
that can be a common mistake because

691
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,520
someone's like right well we know

692
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,120
absolutely apt said J is really

693
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,159
interested in interesting now let's um

694
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:13,320
look at everything they do and you do

695
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,880
get copycats as well that's the other

696
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,039
side of it if someone can like okay I've

697
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,720
found these three things because we're

698
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,460
lazy and we don't want to investigate

699
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,799
properly sometimes

700
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,480
um therefore it's these guys thank you

701
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,799
I've done my job on to the next thing

702
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:27,299

703
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,940
damn busy as well so

704
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,520

706
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:35,039
