1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:03,600
thanks everyone uh

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,920
can everyone hear me all right I think

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,779
yeah sounds good right perfect so I'm

4
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:08,340
Joe uh and I'm gonna be talking about my

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,840
research into the cyber crime group

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,160
known as trickbot

7
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,559
so because Emily first who am I got a

8
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:15,420
nice big picture of myself that's great

9
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,580
uh so I'm a student I'm still a third

10
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,859
year student at University of York and

11
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:21,119
I'm also a threat intelligence Analyst

12
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,619
at side Jack so I do both at the same

13
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:23,699
time

14
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,320
um I've got some experience working into

15
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,300
I've done some fantastic stuff I've done

16
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,420
some threat Intel stuff uh and I enjoyed

17
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,880
drinking pints and tracking for actors a

18
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,040
nice nice simple thing so just for

19
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,899
context for people who don't know we've

20
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:39,960
got trickbot so trickbot is a uh as the

21
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,360
ncsc describes it was an established

22
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,640
sort of banking malware we saw it with

23
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,020
the idea being it was a Trojan that

24
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,120
would steal banking credentials and it

25
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,460
was being operated by a threat group but

26
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,739
we weren't really sure at that time who

27
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:54,300
was behind that so much so they got

28
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,640
known as trickbot we got lots of aliases

29
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,620
for that obviously with the apts having

30
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,780
15 different names for them all we've

31
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,000
got ones such as wizard spider we've got

32
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,700
like UNC uh one eight seven eight and

33
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,380
then we've got gold Blackburn uh which I

34
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,540
hadn't actually heard of before but we'd

35
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,740
also sort of theorized a lot of these

36
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,080
groups have a lot of links together and

37
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,939
so what we'd seen was that they were

38
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:17,460
linked to groups like ryuk emote and

39
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,320
Maze and that these things are sort of

40
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,880
bundled together

41
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,220
so I'm going to talk about the tripod

42
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,600
leaks which was what my research was

43
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,100
into so we had

44
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,380
um so yeah this was basically how I

45
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,759
delved into sort of the inner workings

46
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,340
of how a cyber crime operation works so

47
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,920
a bit of context uh my my sort of

48
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,720
history that goes back six months

49
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,040
because of my I was always bad at

50
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,119
history

51
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,340
um you know this on the 24th of February

52
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,100
Russia invaded Ukraine uh now that was

53
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,020
obviously that happened and we saw quite

54
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,759
a lot of outfall from that but one of

55
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,840
the things we saw that happened very

56
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,360
quickly after that was the ransomware

57
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,759
group Conte so Conti came out on their

58
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,040
forum and they posted supporting the

59
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,780
Russian government and they said that

60
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,640
any enemy of the Russian government is

61
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,860
an enemy of us we're in full support of

62
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,939
what they're doing

63
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:05,399
so then after that

64
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,500
they weren't too light they got quite a

65
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,258
lot of hate for that post and so two

66
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:12,300
days later Conti retracted their

67
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,400
statement saying oh no actually we don't

68
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,540
support the Russian government anymore

69
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,340
we don't we still like like the Russians

70
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,020
but we won't hack you back again so but

71
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,760
unless you're an enemy of us because

72
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,379
people started to get upset by what

73
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:23,700
they'd said

74
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,160
so this obviously happened and a lot of

75
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,080
people were annoyed at conti and then on

76
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,520
the same day that they retracted their

77
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,739
statement clearly not quick enough uh an

78
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:33,300
accountant of the name Conti leaks was

79
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,700
made on Twitter and I'm sure everyone

80
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,620
here has probably heard of Conti leaks

81
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,819
this was probably one of the biggest

82
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:40,860
events of like in the sort of CTI space

83
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,959
this year this Twitter account started

84
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,120
leaking thousands and thousands of

85
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,040
messages from the ransomware group

86
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,280
allowing us to effectively see what was

87
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,720
going on

88
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,519
what happened at the same time though

89
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,160
was on like a few days later again in

90
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,660
the start of March another Twitter

91
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,700
account came about called trick leaks or

92
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,099
top tricks I think was their their title

93
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,959
now they started leaking information and

94
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:06,060
messages from the trickbot ransomware

95
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,940
crew and while everyone was still like

96
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,220
dealing and trying to analyze the trip

97
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,840
the Conti leagues the tripod leaks

98
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,819
almost fell to the side and so we saw

99
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,220
them post over a period of two months

100
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,980
posting periodically messages from this

101
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,840
group now to put that into context the

102
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,760
Conte leaks was around 60 000 messages

103
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,019
total

104
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:27,480
whereas the trickbot leaks was about a

105
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,860
quarter of a million

106
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,220
so significantly more so the first thing

107
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,159
that we saw being involved was these

108
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:37,379
doxing PDFs now yes this is our a lovely

109
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:39,420
Uh Russian gentleman over here

110
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,379
um he was part of trigma so

111
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:46,080
these soil PDFs contained a lot of

112
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,700
information and I mean a lot we're

113
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,159
talking full names dates of birth

114
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,159
locations we had IP addresses tax

115
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:55,860
numbers passport numbers anything you

116
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,900
can think of we started to see in these

117
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,159
PDFs and these are being released

118
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:01,379
alongside those messages

119
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:02,940
but what that sort of posed the question

120
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,519
was was where is that information coming

121
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,680
from where are we get where have they

122
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,680
found that information and got it from

123
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,319
is it a back end Source have they got

124
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,540
some sort of data store about their

125
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,660
employees that they've pulled from is it

126
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,760
just ocean have they done some very very

127
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,520
good ocean and pulled out that data to

128
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,740
build these PDFs and I I and or was it a

129
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,180
personal contact did they know the

130
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,919
people were they involved with them did

131
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:30,240
they did they know them personally to

132
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,280
ask them this information not knowing

133
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,280
they were being doxed now personally I

134
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,600
think it was a combination of a lot of

135
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,160
things some of this information is

136
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,020
reasonable to be found in open source

137
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,240
intelligence some of it there is

138
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,000
slightly less so why do we have full tax

139
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,040
identification numbers why do we have

140
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,840
full passports previous employment

141
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,180
history things like that that maybe

142
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,160
would have been harder to cooperate

143
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,900
alongside this we also had what I

144
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,880
thought I've coined the list so if you

145
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,380
can see here we had a tweet that was

146
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,240
posted where he just said list which is

147
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,680
nice and helpful because it tells us

148
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,900
lots what it actually was was a list of

149
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:08,040
133 usernames emails phone numbers ID

150
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,040
numbers for every single person that

151
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,360
they claim was part of the trigger

152
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,580
organization so for example on the left

153
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,500
here you can see names usernames

154
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,139
including Ford hash budget band Bentley

155
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:23,639
biggie bourbon there was 133 in total

156
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,800
suddenly that really shows us the scale

157
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,419
of this group we thought this was just a

158
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:28,620
banking malware that's great but no

159
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,500
there's 133 individual users that are

160
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,759
claimed to be behind this crew

161
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:36,900
we also found that there was operational

162
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,280
infrastructure they were using now I've

163
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,500
broken it down into three simple

164
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,120
explanation once we had one which I've

165
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,919
coined the Bots and loaders this is

166
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,780
because in Russian they would just post

167
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,240
Bart loader with giant lists of IP

168
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,740
addresses which is obviously very useful

169
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,440
and they would do this weekly and we're

170
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,740
talking tens of IP addresses weekly now

171
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,360
what it appears to be from the research

172
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,940
we did was that these IP addresses were

173
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,820
being used to distribute and contact

174
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,800
their malware so we're operating as both

175
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,440
the the bot being the distributor of the

176
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,020
malware and the loader being the C2 to

177
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,300
deliver further payloads further malware

178
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,120
and and further attacks

179
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,639
we also had the vps's and sshs now this

180
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,560
one was quite surprising to me when we

181
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,820
started looking at this stuff I

182
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,560
obviously thought looking at cyber crime

183
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,819
groups what are they going to do well

184
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:24,660
they're not going to pay for

185
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,979
infrastructure there's they're a cyber

186
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:27,479
crime group they'll just Nick it off

187
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:30,600
someone else oh no uh there was quite a

188
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,979
lot of regular messages there was some

189
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:34,139
guy I think is yeah Carter his job was

190
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:36,240
to pay for their VPS servers they were

191
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,979
paying for infrastructure they had a

192
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:39,180
bunch of different emails obviously I

193
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,860
blanked out the passwords here but from

194
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,319
all sorts of providers we're talking you

195
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,240
know and these are actual Pros we've got

196
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,460
VPS today host for their Elder node and

197
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,979
this list went on and on and on and

198
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:51,300
they're paying for this on a regular

199
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,400
basis so not only are they using like

200
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,500
stolen hacked infrastructure but they

201
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,720
are also using that

202
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,440
that actually paid for VPS servers

203
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,080
and alongside this we also saw what I've

204
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,840
got here the antivirus testing services

205
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,400
now obviously if you're developing

206
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,919
malware at the rate that these guys were

207
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:12,660
you need something to test is going to

208
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,500
work because if I'm going to be

209
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,780
delivering malware to someone I need to

210
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,639
know that when it gets there Windows

211
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,440
Defender or Norton isn't going to go up

212
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,720
you've got trickbot and immediately ban

213
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,800
the sort of malware from being

214
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,960
distributed so what they had was a

215
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,199
series of servers and and licenses for

216
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:32,160
every single major brand of antivirus on

217
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,800
the market today all being hosted and a

218
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,120
system where what they could do was say

219
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,500
right we've got a new malware we've just

220
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,080
re-obfuscated our new our malware post

221
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,580
it to that server and that's that would

222
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,139
then distribute it to every single

223
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:45,300
antivirus service that's that's being

224
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,479
used we've got including here we have uh

225
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,620
Sophos Trend Micro McAfee uh scitec

226
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,919
Avast web routes I think that one is

227
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:56,639
um

228
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,620
uh if I could read Russian I'd probably

229
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,120
be able to but I can't

230
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,280
um so we've got all these sort of big

231
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,900
name brands they're using this as a

232
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,819
testing ground is our malware gonna work

233
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,500
so a serious amount of actual

234
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,720
infrastructure and servers behind this

235
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,919
operation

236
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:13,440
slowly building that sort of picture we

237
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,060
also have the bot Legos club now this

238
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,979
was quite a fun one uh they kept

239
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:18,479
referencing something called bot laggers

240
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,160
and I was like oh they're just misle

241
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,479
spelling Bootleggers because bear in

242
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:22,800
mind all of these messages were in

243
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,479
Russian so I translate them all out to

244
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,400
miss translation but then it came up too

245
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,500
many times to be a mistranslation

246
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,599
so what was it so I look it up bought

247
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:32,940
Lego's Club it was one result on Google

248
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,559
from a mandian article from two years

249
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,240
ago where they said we think they might

250
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,559
be using something called the botleggers

251
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,120
club full stop

252
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,740
that was it

253
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,899
I was okay there's got to be more than

254
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:45,600
that so I spent a couple of days pulling

255
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,800
out everything we could about the

256
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,240
botleggers club

257
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,980
what actually turned out was I found an

258
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,959
IP address and multiple tour addresses

259
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:52,800
for that

260
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,380
what that came to was this unfortunately

261
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,060
it's not live anymore they took it down

262
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,860
after the leaks in a mad rush to kill

263
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,320
all of their infrastructure but it was a

264
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,000
login panel

265
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,860
and behind this login panel from what

266
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,740
they're explaining was a Management

267
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,920
Center for malware not just like a case

268
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,480
of I'm going to go on my Outlook and

269
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,220
start saying no no this or I'm going to

270
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,720
start sending this manually to my

271
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,399
thousands of bots no this was a

272
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:19,620
centralized management interface for

273
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,080
their malware not only for delivery but

274
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,600
for updates and for customization

275
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,339
I've got a new version the old version

276
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:28,800
is being caught upload that you're now a

277
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,180
thousand Bots say you've got in your

278
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,160
infrastructure all of them can now host

279
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,940
and deliver that malware in an instant

280
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,459
optimized delivery of malware

281
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:40,860
we also developed memes and you can sort

282
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,180
of see the picture I'm trying to build

283
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,040
here of This Crew

284
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,140
obviously again we usually picture a lot

285
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,640
of these characters as small dissident

286
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,640
groups and this whereas actually in this

287
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,459
case we had development teams

288
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:56,700
with managers and bosses and deadlines

289
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,820
and project specifications

290
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,500
so for example here were just five of

291
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,180
the key ones we found so we have the

292
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,500
cryptos here at the moment all of the

293
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,720
net names you see listed those are all

294
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,700
the members of that group uh if you know

295
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,380
you so wanted to know how big each of

296
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,080
the teams were cryptos obviously are the

297
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,420
job of how do we

298
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,000
um sort of obfuscate our malware so we

299
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,459
had a massive team where each person was

300
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:23,399
specifically told whatever you do

301
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:26,580
you want to put a you're going to take a

302
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,779
piece of malware you're going to

303
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:29,880
obfuscate it and mess it around so it's

304
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,519
no longer identifiable

305
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:33,779
and each one of those people was

306
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:36,120
indicated what you have to do is do this

307
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,220
individually you're not to work as teams

308
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,440
you're to work as a crew you have to

309
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,300
work individually and help each other

310
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,920
because they want as many different

311
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,959
obfuscates as possible

312
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:48,060
so they're working with with I can't

313
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,500
remember exactly work how many years but

314
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,480
at least in double figures worth of

315
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,920
different cryptos being built

316
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,779
simultaneously

317
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,060
we've then got loaders again the ability

318
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,560
to load their malware more quickly

319
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,480
potentially this operations on the

320
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,700
loaders they talked about earlier but we

321
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,140
had another development team all of them

322
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,360
working collaborating together sharing

323
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,760
ideas sharing sort of development tips

324
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,160
oh this worked for me oh I'm starting to

325
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,019
find if we use this system call we're

326
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:15,540
getting caught stop that

327
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,160
we have talks I'm sure some of you heard

328
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,260
of talks talks is becoming quite a more

329
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,300
popular through actor Communication

330
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,560
channel

331
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,360
um it was sort of being uh it's being

332
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,700
sort of actively maintained on GitHub uh

333
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,860
the tops group was being used primarily

334
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,019
because they wanted a group chat feature

335
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:32,519
which has now been implemented after

336
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:35,279
they uh cried about it for so long uh

337
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,839
but now they have a group chat feature

338
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:38,040
and they want to talk to each other and

339
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,540
they have had a team where they

340
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,760
communicated and there was influences

341
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,660
that potentially they were even

342
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,279
communicating with the developers of

343
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:49,260
and if I remember correctly even with

344
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,300
the group leader saying well if we need

345
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,100
to we'll just pay him some money

346
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,779
well we need him to develop a group chat

347
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:56,220
feature I know he's just an open source

348
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,600
developer but we've got loads of money

349
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,060
why don't we just pay him some of ours

350
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,740
we've then got lockers again the ability

351
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,839
to Crypt up that mount to Crypt up the

352
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,060
systems and to crack systems they had a

353
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,800
few people doing that wasn't as big

354
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,700
because remember they're a banking

355
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,320
Trojan but actually why are they

356
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,120
developing this sort of like maybe sort

357
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,399
of ransomware style lockers

358
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,019
well maybe it's because they're actually

359
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:17,880
trying to see how wide their reach can

360
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,579
go this is a big operation and finally

361
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:21,959
fire team which doesn't actually explain

362
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:24,959
anything fire team was an ocean team

363
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,660
this is a sort of 10 strong plus strong

364
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,480
osync team so for example

365
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,279
uh let's say we're gonna pick the

366
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:34,200
vertical of like Transportation that's

367
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,579
what they do every week they pick a

368
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:37,200
vertical and say right here are the top

369
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,700
10 companies we want to Target in

370
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,680
transportation each one of you pick one

371
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,600
and you produce me an ocean report you

372
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,060
got a week they reproduce a full PDF

373
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,040
open portfolio again all of these are no

374
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,720
longer available but they've produced a

375
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,180
full PDF ocent report of everything they

376
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,760
can find about you your company your

377
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,620
contacts everything

378
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,600
because this is beneficial to them when

379
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,620
suddenly they want to now start

380
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,779
targeting you and this starts to build

381
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,579
this picture of a sort of interconnected

382
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:05,279
organization

383
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,019
so

384
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,820
within this data we've got a lot of them

385
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,440
there was the sort of that is the data

386
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,579
we saw but there's some sort of

387
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:13,440
conclusions and observations we can

388
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,980
start to draw from that

389
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,480
so

390
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,779
the first one is the trigbot or a

391
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:23,399
business

392
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:27,240
now commonly we talk about cyber crime

393
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,399
as if it's like oh you know it's the

394
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:33,360
hacker in a basement wearing a hoodie

395
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,860
this is not what we're talking about

396
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,700
here this is a business and I mean that

397
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,920
in the same sense that all of you are

398
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,779
working businesses they work in a

399
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:44,040
business too

400
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,959
for example this long message behind me

401
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:47,279
which I won't read out and if you can

402
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,440
read well done is actually them hiring

403
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,320
someone uh their HR guy uh I think his

404
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,660
name was Francis also goes by mango that

405
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,339
was their HR representative at the time

406
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:58,620
uh because of course if you're working

407
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,760
in a business you need a HR

408
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,019
representative doesn't matter that you

409
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:02,700
work in cyber crime

410
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,519
so he Francis found our friend here on a

411
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,260
forum he was just saying oh Scout we had

412
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,000
a good team scouting the forums and what

413
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,579
we used that to do was to say okay

414
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:13,260
let's advertise to you we found you I

415
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,360
like the work you're doing okay let's

416
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,860
start talking about salaries we'll pay

417
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,839
you twice a month the every single base

418
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:20,339
developer was paid a salary of around

419
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:23,100
two grand in Bitcoin twice a month so

420
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,300
you're being so salary of every month

421
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,160
sorry two grand in Bitcoin a grand every

422
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,019
single month that's not bad for a

423
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:30,060
developer especially with the way that a

424
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,060
lot of the sort of markets were going

425
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,519
um they got bonuses uh I mean this was a

426
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,560
same in the Conti leaks we saw my

427
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,600
favorite story from Conti leaks

428
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,660
um was that they had a bonus scheme so

429
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,459
the way it worked was if you were bad

430
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:46,620
and didn't do your job then what would

431
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,260
they do well you got docked pay and what

432
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,180
happened to that pay that pay went into

433
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,980
a pool and every month the hardest

434
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,839
working employee would get all the money

435
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:56,519
from the people who didn't do their jobs

436
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:58,860
properly through a bonuses scheme

437
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,680
they would reward you for good work this

438
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,839
happens regularly

439
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,459
we also think about the gaining they're

440
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:06,660
asking for previous experience and

441
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,839
skills so sometimes that skill could be

442
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,480
as simple as for example in this example

443
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,639
did you do carding did you work

444
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,220
developing malware what did you do on

445
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,680
that forum so I think in this example

446
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,720
our guy was sort of a bit of interested

447
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,220
in everything he'd done a bit of carding

448
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,660
because as you've seen a lot of forums

449
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,220
now carding is quite an entry level

450
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,440
start to cyber crime it's very easy to

451
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,820
steal credit cards which is quite

452
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,680
terrifying to say but unfortunately it's

453
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,579
the case

454
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:34,800
so a lot of people start on that and I'm

455
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,880
quite interested in malware I'm crazy

456
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,199
and the guy's like okay I like your

457
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,180
attitude I'm trying to build an ocean

458
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,339
team I would like you to be my ocean

459
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:44,160
lead and the guy's like yeah great that

460
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,079
sounds well fun and so he introduces

461
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,820
this is your work hours there's so much

462
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,800
your salaries your bonuses this is where

463
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,540
your manager who your line manager is

464
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,060
and at the very end he says my favorite

465
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,100
quote which was have you actually heard

466
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,380
about trickbot and the guy's like no

467
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,820
I've never heard of you because Google

468
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,920
it you'll understand

469
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,240
some of the people they're hiring

470
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,920
haven't even heard of the cyber crime

471
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,300
groups they're actually applying for

472
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,639
they're being pushed just through forums

473
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,620
and like communication through these

474
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,300
sort of channels hey you'd be great to

475
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,220
come work for us come work for us

476
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,720
I don't even know who you are yeah why

477
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,740
not you're gonna pay me two grand a

478
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,699
month yeah it's better than I'm getting

479
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:20,359
paid anywhere else

480
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:22,260
so we also found just like as a good

481
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:25,620
example how they were being paid so

482
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,360
obviously again HR they're paying you

483
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,699
every sort of twice a month how are they

484
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:31,680
paying that okay it's a bit rudimentary

485
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,079
they'd pay obviously in Bitcoin but

486
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,760
they're paying you by saying every half

487
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,339
a month send me your wallet address

488
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:40,680
so what we have here

489
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,660
I'll leave the cat for now Cat by the

490
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,980
way is Russian slang when it's

491
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,779
translated for wallet

492
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:47,880
don't ask me why I've tried to work it

493
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,440
out and I'll be gone for a while and

494
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,360
fire post his wallet address there and

495
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,639
then he's like hey guys please pay me

496
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:55,500
he's bored he's like come on I need the

497
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,360
money he's like oh sorry the boss was

498
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,560
gone for three days I didn't have access

499
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,320
to our money stores okay and he says

500
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,779
okay I'll throw it down now sends his

501
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:05,520
ball address so I took his wallet

502
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,619
address I worked in an open source um

503
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,720
sort of an open Explorer here's his

504
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,699
transaction so we can see he asked for

505
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:12,839
one and a half thousand because this guy

506
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,339
was actually on an increased rate of

507
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,919
three grand a month so he says okay

508
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:18,480
here's your transaction and we can see

509
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,579
that about 15 minutes after he

510
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:23,699
complained a transaction left this this

511
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:25,980
wallet here which was marked as like buy

512
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,959
this sort of Explorer as a dangerous or

513
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:30,179
potentially criminal wallet went

514
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:32,340
obviously physics is this the change

515
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,780
went into another wallet they were like

516
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,700
that look suspicious but what's more

517
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,840
interesting is the wallet that was

518
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,880
identified by the criminal as the wallet

519
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,299
they wanted Bibby paid into was not

520
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:44,340
this well it hadn't been identified as

521
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:47,340
malicious this was just fine

522
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,380
that is a proceed of a cyber crime

523
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,900
operation that is a salary being paid

524
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,280
and we can see that as much as people

525
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,240
like to think that obviously the

526
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,140
blockchain is very Anonymous no if you

527
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,120
very much noted not Anonymous

528
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,820
um yeah so that was fire being paid on I

529
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:08,700
think that is the yes the 16th of July

530
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,860
so yeah we started to see that that was

531
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,000
a common Trend and these people were

532
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,820
being paid regularly by their management

533
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,080
and so I don't know if you can slide on

534
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,340
it but the management structure was

535
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,260
there so we have again like I say

536
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,480
Francis Francis was a HR guy but we also

537
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,640
had bosses we had Stern stern was the

538
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,160
boss in both trickball and Conti leaks

539
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,960
people often mean referred to as the

540
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,600
chief in this sort of League because he

541
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,120
was the chief

542
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,580
um we had also people like Mayer Who was

543
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,080
another big player had all these big

544
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,520
guys in the scene and they are

545
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,320
management they're being referred to as

546
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,000
the technical director director of

547
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,160
operations he is the this is the guy who

548
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,660
does infrastructure operation he's the

549
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,100
virtual machine guy who manages all of

550
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,140
our virtual operator operations these

551
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,299
things are real

552
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:52,860
so the second con

553
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,120
collaboration

554
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,260
so

555
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,940
when we think about these groups and

556
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,679
there's often the famous quote of oh

557
00:18:58,679 --> 00:18:59,940
there's a you know there's no there's no

558
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,260
trust among Thieves and all that sort of

559
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,640
stuff well they wouldn't trust each

560
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,539
other

561
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:05,580
if anything this proved the direct

562
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,780
opposite

563
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,880
so at the top of each of those PDFs we

564
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,220
spoke about was the quote about that got

565
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,380
leaked it said this member of the hacker

566
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,360
group trickbot who is also known as

567
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,059
wizard spiders Riot May's Conti diabol

568
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:19,620
now that's a hell of a statement to make

569
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,200
off off the bit to say they're all the

570
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,460
same

571
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,080
but actually there was a lot more

572
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,240
information that sort of supplemented

573
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,780
that as we started to look so

574
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,880
we had messages that supported it so we

575
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,260
have internal messages so we have one

576
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,240
here silver says silver but also being

577
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,520
another guy who was probably the top guy

578
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,200
in trickbot he clearly looked like he

579
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,700
managed it because if you look at all

580
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,320
those development teams who was the guy

581
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,440
who created them our good friend Silva

582
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,720
he says hey uh Esteban Esther uh

583
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,820
esteban's away you need to get access to

584
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,740
him oh what's his project again oh yeah

585
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,720
it's called dear vault

586
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,179
so Esteban here our good friend is

587
00:19:57,179 --> 00:19:58,919
managing Diego

588
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:00,419
well there we go there's a direct link

589
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:03,059
his job is to manage and create devil

590
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:05,340
but we also found things where

591
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,980
actual messages were being copied across

592
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,360
the county leagues so we saw message

593
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,220
logs in the Conti leaks that were direct

594
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,080
copies in the trickball leagues now

595
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,700
there's only one or two reasons why that

596
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,919
may be happening potentially because

597
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:18,900
actually there's a lot more overlap in

598
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,460
this organization than we originally

599
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,960
thought so there's often this

600
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,520
observation there's thousands of threat

601
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,660
actors and you've got to constantly look

602
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,820
at it but I actually this paint's a

603
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,799
different picture so the way I suggested

604
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,660
it in the report was that the wizard

605
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,120
spider as I'm gonna say could be some

606
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,160
main organization some main sort of

607
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,080
group we're gonna call it I'm actually

608
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,380
under that is different branches within

609
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,660
the company so we've got trickbot

610
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,400
they're our banking malware we've got

611
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,020
Conti they're our ransomware operation

612
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,760
we've got dival which appeared to

613
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,740
actually be a testing ground for

614
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,960
features in Conte let's whack things in

615
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,640
diabol because nobody really cares about

616
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,260
demo and then if that works really well

617
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,700
we'll whack it in Conti because then

618
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,960
it's really going to make some damage

619
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,179
bear in mind Conti being I think if I

620
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:01,740
remember correctly one of the most

621
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,140
profitable ransomware through 2020 and

622
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:08,600
2021 since it didn't demise

623
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,340
and then again we also had external

624
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,780
collaboration so not only did we have

625
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,360
this internal communication between the

626
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,340
groups saying okay we've got like Conti

627
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,380
we've got trickbot we've got D of all

628
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,600
maze we also had external collaboration

629
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,919
so we found it I found a very

630
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:24,240
interesting communication because this

631
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,000
guy called Zeus who also went by Robin

632
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,039
and people were discussing Robin not

633
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,840
only like he was a person

634
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,140
but as a software and as a group he was

635
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,580
being referred to in all the manner of

636
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,679
ways so I was like who is this Zeus

637
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,200
character you look into it now there was

638
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,120
a famous bot that was being released and

639
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,740
it was also a banking malware called

640
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:47,159
zedbot not as popular and they were made

641
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:48,720
by a group which we think was called

642
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,480
Zeus because we think the Zed the Zeus

643
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,880
now when we look into it

644
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,620
we found more and more messages and as I

645
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,539
started to dig deeper and deeper what we

646
00:21:57,539 --> 00:21:58,799
found was a lovely message here that

647
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,539
explained exactly what I needed it to

648
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:01,559
say

649
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:02,940
hey

650
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,520
what's our relationship with Zeus

651
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,940
oh well he started out as a client

652
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,380
but we've had a good relationship and

653
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,520
now he's progressed to one of our

654
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,919
partners we're good friends now

655
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,280
that's a terrifying sentence the idea of

656
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,140
there being clients in this organization

657
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,179
we've got trickbot a threat Group which

658
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:23,159
we look at and go okay they're dangerous

659
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:26,159
but now they're supplying other crime

660
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,679
groups with their operations when we're

661
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:30,360
talking in a hundred and potentially a

662
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,460
hundreds over a hundred strong group

663
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,280
that are developing producing and

664
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,799
deploying malware why not offer those

665
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:40,200
Services out to other groups oh we find

666
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,120
it really difficult to bypass this AV oh

667
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,799
well we've got a team of 15 people that

668
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:46,020
spend their dedicated jobs doing that do

669
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,039
you want a hand

670
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,640
payoffs or as in the case of Zeus what

671
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,320
happened they worked with them I

672
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,880
couldn't find any payments or any of

673
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,679
this discussion of that but what I did

674
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,140
find that was quite interesting was in a

675
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,600
report published we found that in in 20

676
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,880
I think it was 2021

677
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,340
the Zeus module was now a module of

678
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,080
trickbot

679
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,539
so now we're offering Services actually

680
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:11,159
do you know what I like the way your

681
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:12,659
banking malware works this specific

682
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:15,900
thing how about you come and join us and

683
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,240
you become part of our ransomware this

684
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,020
is a collaboration between businesses

685
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,940
and the final one was about the changing

686
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,500
now I'm sure as many of you have heard

687
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,720
conti and trick but had a bit of a

688
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,520
tumultuous time at the start of this

689
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,200
year after declaring that they were

690
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,700
going to take down Costa Rica and then

691
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,679
kind of failing quite spectacularly and

692
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:37,260
then disappearing Into The Ether

693
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,520
um well it was actually quite

694
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,840
interesting because they were talking

695
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,220
about this a lot earlier now obviously

696
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,780
this message apologies if you can't read

697
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,539
it I will explain the gist

698
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:47,820
the first sentence is simple

699
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,760
I sincerely apologize for not being here

700
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,860
regarding the chief and Silva and

701
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:53,880
salaries

702
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,200
the reason I had is because I have

703
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,179
nothing to say I'm dragging my feet

704
00:23:57,179 --> 00:23:58,980
screwing around with the celery the best

705
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,240
I could and hoping the chief would show

706
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,799
up and give us Clarity on our next steps

707
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:03,900
but the chief is gone and the situation

708
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,760
is not getting any softer and pulling

709
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,860
the cat by the balls is making no sense

710
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,200
anymore which is a great idiom I think

711
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,460
but what we're finding is that they

712
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,679
they're finding that what happened is

713
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,600
the chief being what we think is Stern

714
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,960
and silver have disappeared they've gone

715
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,820
and there's now no money left to pay

716
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,380
salaries

717
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,780
so they can't pay their developers and

718
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,700
their malware researchers

719
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,799
and because of this account and

720
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,240
infrastructure now being suspended

721
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,460
they're worried about these leaks this

722
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,080
was after we'd seen some of the leaks

723
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,700
actually we hadn't seen them publicly

724
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,100
but they were saying internally and the

725
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:42,360
quotes from the scrutiny from The Firm

726
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,280
I'm I'm gonna let you make your own

727
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,480
conclusions of what they mean by that

728
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,860
but

729
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,179
they're starting to suspend him

730
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:50,039
structure they're panicking it's it's in

731
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:52,020
full shutdown mode now

732
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,580
contact we made in two to three months

733
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,840
when we start things up again they

734
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,760
started to take contact details of their

735
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,740
employee of their of their employees we

736
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,960
haven't got money I'm sorry please

737
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,640
contact us and we'll try and work to

738
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,780
build this back

739
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,700
and this works this actually fits quite

740
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,380
nicely with what we've seen a lot of

741
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,940
other researchers understand where the

742
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,640
idea being that Conti disbanded and then

743
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,020
built into other groups like we saw

744
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,059
black master and avos locker and Hello

745
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:17,820
Kitty they're like abilities were then

746
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,280
used to bolster those groups because of

747
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,580
this collaborative nature

748
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,960
so I don't know whether this was them

749
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,400
saying we'll take the contact so we did

750
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,779
see some people saying hey for example

751
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:29,279
fire in the fire team was like Hey guys

752
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,900
I've worked with you for a long give me

753
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,820
your contact details and I'll see what I

754
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,679
can do for us

755
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:36,480
but they fell over

756
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,299
they were a single point of failure

757
00:25:38,299 --> 00:25:41,460
despite being an organization big that

758
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,320
is would be not even clusters of small

759
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,820
business really

760
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,320
they were at a single point of failure

761
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,700
and that's where actually that no trust

762
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,980
within crime comes back

763
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,380
all of their money was controlled by

764
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,880
these two guys

765
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,380
that's what it says here they we had

766
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,779
lost all access to our funds there's no

767
00:25:57,779 --> 00:26:00,419
backup plan you take out that lead guy

768
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:03,179
the rest starts to crumble

769
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:05,580
that's what we saw here the chief and

770
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,020
Stern have gone they've gone into hiding

771
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:10,279
everything falls over

772
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,600
so in conclusion about this I'll leave

773
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,220
you with some quotes that I gave to a

774
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,600
report they were I was asked about this

775
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,279
thing and I gave two two sort of quotes

776
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,760
that I think sum this up nicely in a way

777
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,440
the crossover between the higher-ups of

778
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,419
conti and trickbot paints a picture of a

779
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:26,760
new threat landscape that is highly

780
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,679
interconnected and capable and one where

781
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:30,600
threat actors work together for a common

782
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,460
goal

783
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,860
that's what we're in now it's no longer

784
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,740
US versus one angry person or a couple

785
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,299
of people who don't feel great on I know

786
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:40,919
a bit about computers that still happens

787
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:42,179
yes

788
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:44,400
but it's now not no longer just that we

789
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,799
are now in an interconnected network of

790
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,140
criminals working together to fight you

791
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,940
because without that

792
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,860
they can't fight against you guys we've

793
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,880
got some great you know great business

794
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,799
great tools they've got they've got to

795
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:57,360
innovate the same way and that's what

796
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,100
leads to this second quote about

797
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,720
this Outlook enables businesses and

798
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,159
researchers to appropriately manage the

799
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:03,900
risk that these three actors pose in a

800
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,880
scenario where now it is a cyber crime

801
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,039
business versus your business

802
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:10,980
it is not just a loan threat actor or

803
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,200
something like that versus your giant

804
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,360
infrastructure it's now a business of

805
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,620
infrastructure versus your

806
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,600
infrastructure and when we start to

807
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,940
consider that that allows us to have to

808
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,980
manage that sort of threat properly

809
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,960
because if we don't treat them with the

810
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,340
level of severity that they probably

811
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,260
deserve

812
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:31,440
we're only going to come up short

813
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,299
so yeah thanks guys for listening uh

814
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:34,380
yeah you've got any questions about

815
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,020
anything I'll happily I can try my best

816
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,820
all right everyone

817
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:42,779
am I on yeah awesome so one of the

818
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:44,700
things you can do is you can find Joe's

819
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,240
interview at security magazine uh and

820
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,760
you just look for Joe myself and Philip

821
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,340
Ingram who passed the information that

822
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,440
Joe had discovered on to his colleagues

823
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,480
within the ncsc and other law

824
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,000
enforcement so great job Joe so good

825
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,460
we're gonna take about a nine minute

826
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,500
break to get back on schedule we've got

827
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,620
a question go ahead

828
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:09,539
cheers thank thank you so uh obviously

829
00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:11,340
the these organizations are using

830
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,380
Bitcoin to get paid yeah and sort of

831
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,600
transfer value around yeah is there any

832
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,400
risk of them moving on to something like

833
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,340
coin join or tornado cash yeah other

834
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,380
currencies like Monero so with things

835
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,779
like tornado cash so I spend also quite

836
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:26,640
nicely the other half of my time apart

837
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,140
from looking at these guys I spent my

838
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,640
life looking at the reasons crypto is

839
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,559
starting to fall over and tornado cash

840
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:34,020
is one of those so we've started to see

841
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,360
a massive move to tornado cash because

842
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,520
of the fact that it gives anonymity and

843
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,380
it's easy to use I don't have to spend

844
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,700
hours playing around with different

845
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,900
things I can go right I want to use

846
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,760
tornado cash put my money in pull my

847
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,500
money out well I've now got proceeds of

848
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,059
crime and when we're talking numbers up

849
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,039
to Millions but that's what was

850
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:51,360
interesting about this was they weren't

851
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,520
using these mixing Services because they

852
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,900
thought they weren't going to get seen

853
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,179
and when you're a crime group who's

854
00:28:57,179 --> 00:28:58,740
operating under the assumption of hey

855
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,299
nobody's watching what we're doing

856
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:01,640
because this is an internal Channel

857
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,200
they're happy to just send here's my

858
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,779
personal wallet address boom

859
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:08,220
because why wouldn't you it's an

860
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,720
internal channel the same way that we

861
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,340
may talk on our team's channels at work

862
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,140
well if I was to say oh this is my

863
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,760
here's my pin here's my sort cone and

864
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,960
pin number energy well it's not going to

865
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,820
get late so it's fine

866
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,679
so the public stuff you start to see

867
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:20,700
that a lot more and so when they were

868
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,600
trying to move their money around

869
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,419
publicly yeah 100 but in that sort of

870
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:26,880
payment scheme I think it almost was a I

871
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,860
don't believe I'm being watched and

872
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,020
because of that we could see more of a

873
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,460
sort of direct I trust you with my

874
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,140
wallet address because you're my boss

875
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,760
and why wouldn't I and you're the guy

876
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,799
who pays me but yeah those sort of

877
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:39,659
services I think are being used but much

878
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:42,059
more for a public display of I've hacked

879
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:43,919
100 million out of a bridge I need to

880
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,539
get that into my personal wallet without

881
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:47,159
people seeing it and whacking it in that

882
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:48,299
way

883
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:51,539
awesome so great we got another question

884
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:54,899
so so trickbot was a botnet of about a

885
00:29:54,899 --> 00:29:56,760
million infected devices and it's kind

886
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,220
of shut down now what uh malware

887
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,539
families do you think are sort of

888
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:03,240
filling that vacuum yes so with with the

889
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,279
sort of trick bot dying and Conti dying

890
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,500
I think especially with Conti we've seen

891
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,500
lock bit three and a lot of bit black

892
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,240
absolutely dominate the scene now when

893
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,860
we look at things like if you look at

894
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,600
things like Ransom watch we can see that

895
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,399
lock bit 3 currently holds I think it's

896
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,559
more than three times posts than any

897
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:21,960
other ransomware crew and the third most

898
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,399
one on that layer with number one number

899
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:24,899
two is another one and number three is

900
00:30:24,899 --> 00:30:27,960
lock bit two so really they're kind of

901
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,700
dominating that with the botnet space

902
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,380
it's very different we've seen a big

903
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,360
scrap for their infrastructure we've

904
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,980
seen lots of new botlets especially a

905
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,240
lot written in golang we've seen things

906
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,919
like Kraken we've seen things like those

907
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,600
sort of botnets being built we've also

908
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,220
seen ones like ammo tap being used now

909
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,600
because of the way it's sort of how

910
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,159
powerful that is as a polymorphized

911
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,620
malware so I think what we've seen is a

912
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,940
lot of these guys moving to the other

913
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:50,159
groups and then utilizing their already

914
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,080
existing links with things like ammo

915
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,240
chat and then using that to be able to

916
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,159
build those sorts of still existing

917
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,700
crime threat like landscapes

918
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,380
yeah

919
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,720
oh we got another question awesome we're

920
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,700
gonna get very back on schedule that's

921
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,880
amazing I'm glad that worked

922
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,039
doing all my best uh thanks Joe for

923
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,320
giving us the insight to this uh

924
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,140
ecosystem which they have brought up

925
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:21,059
well in aspects to actually dealing with

926
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:23,340
these groups would it be a possibility

927
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:27,179
to get more research into seeing who is

928
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:29,220
the actually the business leader there

929
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,640
and then just striking off the dragon's

930
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,240
head or the what well I'll I'll have you

931
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,179
may call it yeah it was sort of part of

932
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:40,380
what I think happened at the end when

933
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,820
we're looking at the fact that we have

934
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,679
that single point of failure at the top

935
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,600
that's what I was trying I think that

936
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,980
was trying to show was that actually

937
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,799
when we look at this now there are

938
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:51,659
single points of failure and with the

939
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:53,820
right sort of the dedicated strikes

940
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,760
against certain people we can have that

941
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,980
sort of impact the problem is a lot of

942
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,140
the time they are actually doing quite a

943
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,419
good job of their op sack like as much

944
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:05,100
as they're releasing tons of malware and

945
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,260
tons of iocs and we see millions of

946
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,600
these iocs actually if it's all

947
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,100
actionable intelligence against the

948
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,440
people it's much harder and so we're

949
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,240
relying on these sorts of potential

950
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,700
Insider threats or security researchers

951
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,620
that are actively hacking these groups

952
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:22,020
to pull out that information and so we

953
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,039
have seen I think if I remember

954
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,419
correctly I'm sure Ian will correct me

955
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:26,640
we had a U.S cyber command they did put

956
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,020
out a thing against trickbot saying

957
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,100
we're going to attack them and try and

958
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,500
take them down and we I think with more

959
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,820
of those sorts of things and this sort

960
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,500
of level of information being leaked

961
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,840
these sort of groups will crumble a lot

962
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,480
more frequently but it requires that to

963
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,520
happen and at the moment I don't think

964
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,159
we've seen that massive push to take

965
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,200
that information out there and and docks

966
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,360
these guys a lot more of the time we're

967
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,860
still on the defensive approach because

968
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,779
for the things like lock bit

969
00:32:51,779 --> 00:32:54,539
okay so many people are so preoccupied

970
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,460
with trying to stop themselves getting

971
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,559
hacked that they haven't got the time to

972
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,659
think about okay let's try and hack them

973
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:02,399
back so I think that needs a bit more of

974
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:03,779
a coordinated approach from the security

975
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:05,460
Community but it's definitely a

976
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,880
possibility

977
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,110
cheers everyone

978
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:12,830
[Applause]
