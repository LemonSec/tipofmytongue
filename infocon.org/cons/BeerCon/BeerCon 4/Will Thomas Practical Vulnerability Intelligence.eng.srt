1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,000
four thank you very much for that warm

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,040
welcome

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,299
uh so yeah today I'm going to be talking

4
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:08,160
about uh practical vulnerability

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,620
intelligence something that is uh I've

6
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,080
learned a lot about uh recently and uh

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,540
want to present uh you know some more

8
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,760
information about how to do it so a

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,199
little bit about me

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,140
um well my name's will a bit of Cheeto

11
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,880
token on Twitter I currently work for

12
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,279
the equinix threat analysis Center I

13
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,500
used to work for Sci Jacks I went to the

14
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,480
University of Plymouth I also helped run

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,640
the curated intelligence trust group and

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,800
I also do ocean for the national Child

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,260
Protection task force

18
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,940
um so yeah today I'm going to talk to

19
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,200
you a little bit about practical

20
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,660
vulnerability intelligence what like why

21
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,820
is it important how you can do it and

22
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,160
what happens if you don't do it

23
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,780
so

24
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,460
um you know just a slide about some of

25
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,079
the acronyms and things we're going to

26
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,680
be covering today uh like LP cve sqli

27
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,020
rce uh going to be you know saying a lot

28
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,579
of acronyms so I thought I'd you know

29
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,239
try and introduce you to them

30
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:06,540
so if we go back into the history of

31
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,479
vulnerabilities and and the cve database

32
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,560
so in 1999 it was was when the first cve

33
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,900
list was ever created so about over 20

34
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,780
years ago and then in 2002 uh niss

35
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,000
actually you know recommended using the

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,380
cve list

37
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,780
and then U.S agencies are actually

38
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,580
required to use applications and

39
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,500
products that used cves to track

40
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,659
vulnerabilities and then nist actually

41
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:31,920
launched the national vulnerability

42
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,619
database the NBD to try and track new

43
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:36,060
vulnerabilities

44
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,299
and then 2016 the cve program expanded

45
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,460
and uh you know a whole load of

46
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,340
organizations were actually invited to

47
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,159
come be cve numbering authorities so

48
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,680
companies like Oracle and Cisco can

49
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,600
actually name their own cves

50
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,560
and then in 2021 cesa actually launches

51
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,659
the catalog of known exploited

52
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,360
vulnerabilities which is you know one of

53
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,640
the more recent events and is you know

54
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,100
very pertinent to this talk today

55
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,259
so

56
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:08,639
path practical vulnerability

57
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,139
intelligence is knowing who your

58
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,700
stakeholders are what's the point of

59
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,840
gathering all this intelligence if

60
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,819
you're not going to give it to anyone so

61
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:17,040
part of what we do part of what I do as

62
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,599
a CTI analyst is I identify

63
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,520
vulnerabilities and identify ones that

64
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,140
are exploited in the wild and then I

65
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,580
actually give it over to threat and

66
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,620
vulnerability management team

67
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,840
so what does the threaten vulnerability

68
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,480
management team do they you know they do

69
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,680
asset inventory they have a

70
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,959
configuration management database they

71
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:36,180
use internal and external vulnerability

72
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,220
scanners so sort of network-based

73
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,319
scanning and agent-based scanning

74
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,540
and then he also apply automated

75
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,700
security updates and patches

76
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,319
um you know they apply mitigation and

77
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,760
workarounds if you're unable to patch

78
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,080
you have to try and assess the

79
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,519
feasibility of actually being able to

80
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:52,680
patch a critical vulnerability and they

81
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,720
do all sorts of other uh you know Asset

82
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,000
Management type duties

83
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,040
and they actually are often not the ones

84
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,540
actually doing the patches they are the

85
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,360
ones informing the it admins to apply a

86
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,099
patch

87
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:07,319
so so what does Cyber threat

88
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,239
intelligence do so part of the Cyber

89
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:10,920
intelligence role is to you know support

90
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,019
the TVM team we're going to you know be

91
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:14,519
identifying new vulnerabilities and

92
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:16,560
exploits we're going to be using all

93
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,420
sorts of we're going to use all Source

94
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,459
intelligence not just ocean but also

95
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:22,080
what can you gather from sort of trust

96
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,019
groups and working groups as well and

97
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:26,879
then we're going to basically analyze a

98
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,819
new vulnerability assess uh you know the

99
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:32,280
impact of it contextualize why this one

100
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,480
is important

101
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,640
and then we're going to you know share

102
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,860
that vulnerability advisory report back

103
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,200
to the TVM to the TVM team to make sure

104
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,879
we actually patch the critical

105
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,680
vulnerabilities

106
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,260
um another part of the cti's function

107
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,760
is to monitor the Cyber criminal

108
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,140
underground so we're going to be

109
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,760
infiltrating forms and trying to figure

110
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,220
out uh you know and groups and and try

111
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,060
and figure out what the latest

112
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,500
vulnerabilities that are being exploited

113
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,900
by the threat actors in the wild

114
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,819
and we're also going to be you know

115
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:01,440
tracking the threat landscape Trends as

116
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,819
well

117
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:05,459
so what are some of these Trends so a

118
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:07,980
CTI company called Flashpoint uh earlier

119
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,900
this year yeah earlier this year they

120
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,420
said 11 860 vulnerabilities were

121
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,220
disclosed in 2020 in the first half of

122
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,699
2022 and about 27 of them uh you know

123
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:19,380
were missed by miter so these are

124
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,720
vulnerabilities that aren't like you

125
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,639
know listed in a database that are being

126
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,620
exploited

127
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,500
um so in 2021 uh you know the Google

128
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,900
projects area said they found 58 in the

129
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,280
wild zero days and that's not just in

130
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,440
Google product products you know project

131
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,199
zero research other project products

132
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,460
to be able to secure Google after

133
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,680
operation Aurora and so that you know

134
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,360
that's the highest number of zero days

135
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,979
exploded in the wild since they even

136
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:45,660
started beginning track beginning to

137
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,940
track them

138
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,759
um and Avanti also said that you know 65

139
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:53,100
of they did an analysis of 65 new

140
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,960
vulnerabilities and over one-third of

141
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,400
them were being you know actively

142
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,740
exploited and uh traded around on the

143
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,720
dark web

144
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,880
so zero day exploits

145
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,979
everyone everyone has a little bit of a

146
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:07,259
phobia of those everyone's uh you know

147
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:08,460
there's nothing nothing more fun when

148
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,460
the zero days dropped on a Friday but um

149
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,259
these are these are kind of the most you

150
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:15,240
know important types of vulnerabilities

151
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,460
that you know as a CTI analyst and as a

152
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,259
TPM team you want to be able to track

153
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:21,060
these and make sure that you know

154
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,560
whether you're going to be affected by

155
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,460
them

156
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,860
so basically what a zero D includes is

157
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,240
they are unknown to the vendor the

158
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,680
vendor doesn't know about them but

159
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,360
there's a vulnerability in that software

160
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,400
and often they are exploited in the wild

161
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,320
before the vendor has been able to patch

162
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,039
it

163
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,020
they are highly valuable they can you

164
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,520
know they can be worth you know hundreds

165
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,960
of thousands of dollars or millions of

166
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,220
dollars depending on who you're selling

167
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,120
them to

168
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,080
um you know they're traded on the

169
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,300
Underground markets and they can also be

170
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,800
commercially developed by the exploit

171
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,000
industry

172
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,139
which I'm going to talk about a little

173
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:51,000
bit more later

174
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,960
um

175
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,180
another type of uh

176
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,220
want some of the more interesting types

177
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,560
of zero days that I've come across is uh

178
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,580
sort of

179
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,160
uh zero day vulnerabilities that are in

180
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,960
sort of the software supply chain so

181
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,120
something so open source software even

182
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,800
though you know everyone thinks oh it's

183
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,000
open source and it's you know it's

184
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,860
audited and and multiple people can

185
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,880
review it

186
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,199
um I mean that kind of thing sort of

187
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,940
slips through the gaps when you start to

188
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,020
talk when you start to think about like

189
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,000
what happened with log4j

190
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,940
so the software supply chain so when so

191
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:21,900
some of the examples I've used here

192
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,000
we've got chromium if the vulnerability

193
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,380
is found in chromium you know all the

194
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,300
browsers that use chromium are sort of

195
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,100
affected by it but they're not

196
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,300
necessarily hatched to that

197
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,280
vulnerability as well so they have like

198
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,780
each of the browsers have to manually

199
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,479
you know go in and investigate how their

200
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,919
browser is affected and then apply the

201
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,419
patch so if you can figure out the

202
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:41,340
vulnerability in chromium then you can

203
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,900
you know you have a you have a gap

204
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,660
between uh when the patches are applied

205
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,060
to the downstream browsers and same with

206
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,979
the Linux kernel uh you know Linux

207
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:51,120
kernels used by all sorts of different

208
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,440
devices

209
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,100
um

210
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,380
we've got iot devices and Mobile Android

211
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,900
devices so when vulnerabilities like

212
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,180
pound kit and dirty pipe and and dirty

213
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,979
grid come along it takes a while for the

214
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:03,539
downstream distros to actually apply

215
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:04,919
those patches

216
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:07,199
so that's you know definitely a type of

217
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,759
zero day you want to you know keep an

218
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:11,819
eye on and and and prioritize so because

219
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:14,100
just because of what broad impact

220
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,539
and some of the worst types of zero days

221
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:18,060
uh you know rce remote code execution

222
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,580
unauthenticated to any any system on the

223
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,780
internet as long as you can reach it you

224
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,060
can execute code on it and the same as

225
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,039
being able to upload a file on it a lot

226
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:27,120
of the time you know you can upload a

227
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,160
shell or something to a product

228
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,900
and the information disclosure so

229
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,460
credential leak has sort of passed

230
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,919
traversal being able to just visit a

231
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:37,440
file on a directory and just steal the

232
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,699
credits that way that's happened to

233
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:40,560
quite a few products and then we've got

234
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,360
a one-liner that can fit into a tweet so

235
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,460
you know another shout out to log4j

236
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,020
um speaking of Vlog for Jay

237
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,720
this is kind of the sort of Pinnacle of

238
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,580
zero days you know this thing is going

239
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,400
to be around for you know the next 5 10

240
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,500
15 years the the Department of Homeland

241
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,440
Security reckons and it kind of started

242
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,259
in Minecraft so it kind of started with

243
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:05,940
you know some some basically some

244
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,740
teenagers figuring out that you can just

245
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,199
type in a message on uh in the you could

246
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,940
type it you could type this string and a

247
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,740
message in on the server and then you

248
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,819
can get it to do all sorts of

249
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:16,860
interesting funky stuff so it kind of

250
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,479
relied on the Java naming and directory

251
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,099
interface and it exploited the

252
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,840
lightweight direct directory access

253
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,780
protocol and as soon as it as soon as

254
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,879
they sort of figured out how to do it in

255
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,680
Minecraft then you suddenly had all

256
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,000
these threat actors doing it as well

257
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,680
it's like that much of a ubiquitous

258
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,000
vulnerability

259
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,940
so we had botnets exploiting it uh

260
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,860
ddosport notes crypto cryptocurrency

261
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,140
mining botnets ransomware groups like

262
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:43,440
Conti uh and then uh you know apt nation

263
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,440
state apt groups as well

264
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,140
so another slide sort of explaining zero

265
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,519
day exploitation in the wild some

266
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,860
examples it's not like it's not always

267
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,320
trying to sort of prohome the point that

268
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,180
it's not always in nation state apt

269
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,260
group so they're actually leveraging

270
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,420
zero days it's actually

271
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,980
you know cyber crime groups as well

272
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,019
especially ransomware groups because

273
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:05,580
ransomware groups you know they're

274
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,320
they're basically generating billions of

275
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,260
dollars stealing them from organizations

276
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,880
um they actually have you know the

277
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,440
skills and the abilities and the

278
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,360
resources to be able to invest research

279
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,620
and development and develop their own

280
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,080
zero days these days so we had groups

281
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,019
like Finn 11 are evil uh five hands

282
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:25,320
exotic Lily and the emotec botnap they

283
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,000
all have been able to you know develop

284
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,880
zero days and use them for to you know

285
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,200
basically and financially motivated

286
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,399
campaigns

287
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,860
and of course who can forget you know

288
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,899
Eternal Blue by the shadow broker that

289
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:39,060
was leaked by the shadow Brokers and uh

290
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,640
that was developed by the NSA

291
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,060
so another another sort of source of uh

292
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,940
vulnerabilities is uh Metasploit some of

293
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,019
the interesting things one of the

294
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:50,519
interesting things about Metasploit is

295
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,560
it has a collection of over 2 300

296
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,459
exploits so if you if if you think uh

297
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:58,380
you know what products do you have on

298
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,519
the sort of perimeter of your

299
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,800
organization you know do are any of them

300
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,420
vulnerable to one of these thousands of

301
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,820
exploits that can just be basically you

302
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,920
know launched against uh your products

303
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,080
as a sort of Hail Mary attack

304
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,580
and uh

305
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,779
one of the interesting things about

306
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,279
massploit is you constantly have

307
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:16,620
researchers trying to you know do a pull

308
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,839
request and try and merge their exploits

309
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:21,060
into Metasploit and sometimes you

310
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,220
actually get zero days leaked this way

311
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,980
by researchers you know figuring out how

312
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,040
to reverse engineer and bypass a patch

313
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,200
and uh you know and they try to put it

314
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,519
into max block before anything else

315
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:36,300
which is Handy especially for actors

316
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,300
the exploit industry this is kind of a

317
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,360
more shadowy area but oftentimes when

318
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,940
you when you see apple put out a new uh

319
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,500
security update and they say this

320
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,880
vulnerability was exploited in the wild

321
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,320
quite a lot of the time it's going to be

322
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,060
developed by one of these uh nice

323
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,000
companies NSO group side trucks Exodus

324
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,040
intelligence gamma group they're sort of

325
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,019
you know private Industries a lot of a

326
00:10:58,019 --> 00:10:59,640
lot of these private companies have like

327
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,779
X

328
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:04,320
uh X analysts and and researchers that

329
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,760
used to work for the you know State

330
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,620
intelligence agencies as well sort of

331
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,660
using their skills like mercenaries

332
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,640
really

333
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,680
um this was quite interesting I was

334
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,660
actually approached on LinkedIn by uh

335
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,640
one of these interesting companies and I

336
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,740
immediately saw a few uh red flags when

337
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,720
they say we have government clients

338
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,079
globally we exploit Apple iOS

339
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:26,579
and you know we use all sorts of

340
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:29,279
security research engineer so I sort of

341
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,920
you know want to try and warn people

342
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,079
you know the types of companies that are

343
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,820
doing this are doing it you know for

344
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,620
surveillance for hacking dissidents for

345
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,959
hacking journalists and uh you know

346
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:41,040
anyone who criticizes the government

347
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,380
basically

348
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,940
another source of vulnerability

349
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,760
intelligence is failed bug reports so

350
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,560
sometimes companies have vulnerability

351
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,540
disclosure programs uh you know

352
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,540
something like uh bug crowd or hackawan

353
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,700
or something or even Microsoft's you

354
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,079
know private vulnerability disclosure

355
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,040
program

356
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,899
sometimes the researcher sort of gets

357
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:03,240
frustrated and they may uh feel like

358
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,040
that their bug is not being you know

359
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,660
properly you're not they're not being

360
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,579
properly compensated for the amount of

361
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:09,660
work that they've done to find their

362
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,640
vulnerability by a bug Bounty so

363
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,500
sometimes they just leak it

364
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,320
and you know that's not always ideal but

365
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,820
as a CTI analyst we need to be able to

366
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,440
monitor um you know when this happens

367
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,180
and sometimes there's some researchers

368
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,420
that happens more often than not so

369
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,380
definitely want to keep an eye on some

370
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,540
of them

371
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,240
um hacking competitions so prone to own

372
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,940
uh was was created in uh it began in

373
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,120
2007 and they would actually reward

374
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,200
vulnerability researchers whenever they

375
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,820
found a new zero day

376
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,160
and there was a few uh controversies

377
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,480
about when it first began but everyone

378
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,800
realized you know this is for the

379
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,019
greater good and so one of the teams

380
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:47,639
that was always winning pound to own

381
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:49,139
always getting the top prizes with the

382
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:52,139
Chinese team and they actually basically

383
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:54,540
the Chinese government realized the

384
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,040
Chinese government realized that you

385
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,440
know you know our best researchers are

386
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,820
going to America and helping American

387
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,459
companies and uh or companies that

388
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:03,899
aren't in China so the Chinese

389
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:05,519
government basically you know put a stop

390
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,260
to that and you know they created the

391
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,200
tianfu cup and ever since then

392
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,940
the Chinese government you know has been

393
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,440
basically keeping the vulnerability

394
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,899
research for themselves and uh you know

395
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:18,660
eventually it may get to the vendor

396
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,100
um but you know it has to go through the

397
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,899
Chinese National vulnerability database

398
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:23,880
first the cnbd and you know who has

399
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,279
access to that

400
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,860
so product security testing

401
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,019
so I have another interesting uh source

402
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,540
of of intelligence is when uh you know

403
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,000
you get organizations that are so you

404
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,860
know vulnerability researchers and they

405
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,740
work to basically stop and uh stop uh

406
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,959
identify and help fix vulnerabilities

407
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,000
and products and

408
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,399
sometimes you know they all they often

409
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:50,579
uh can disclose you know new types of

410
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,899
exploitation techniques or new

411
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:54,120
vulnerabilities and products and it's

412
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,579
also you know it's good it's good that

413
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:57,959
they are doing this and it's good that

414
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:00,120
they you know be be able to keep

415
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,160
products secure however you know

416
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,279
sometimes the the vendors whose products

417
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,440
are being exploited don't uh you know

418
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,240
patch in time and there's a nice some of

419
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,860
them have like a 90 day or 100 day

420
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,779
disclosure timeline and if you're not

421
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:14,760
patched by then well then the exploits

422
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,079
public

423
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,779
or the vulnerabilities public at least

424
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:20,519
um so a new point of proof of concept

425
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:22,560
exploitation in the wild

426
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,380
um you know infosec Twitter a lot of

427
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,839
these guys are you know right on it with

428
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,940
as soon as they detect new cves being

429
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,680
exploited in the wild we want to be able

430
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,940
to track

431
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,320
we want to be able to keep track of

432
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,420
whether a new CV is exploited or not and

433
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,620
if you follow some of these guys they

434
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,199
will you know uh Herman Fernandez or bad

435
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:41,699
packets or Shadow server or gray noise

436
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:43,260
they are

437
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,699
you know definitely a great source of

438
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:46,860
information to actually help you realize

439
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,860
if something's being exploited or not

440
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,079
um another source of information is the

441
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,899
cyber cyber criminal underground uh so

442
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:58,380
this was an uh sort of a prolific threat

443
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,660
actor on an underground Forum called

444
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,060
exploit in which is sort of a private

445
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,920
closed access uh russian-speaking

446
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,839
underground Forum you have to pay to be

447
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,180
able to access this to this forum

448
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:09,779
um

449
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:11,699
and then inside this forum you see

450
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:14,339
people offering uh you know zero days

451
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:16,800
and you know access to organizations and

452
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,720
things and as a CTI analyst we need to

453
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,339
be able to sort of monetize these

454
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:22,440
communities and and figure out like

455
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,360
who's who's going after it

456
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,940
so the ecosystem the Cyber criminal

457
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,920
ecosystem is sort of threat actors

458
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,380
looking to open uh looking to buy zero

459
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,779
days and threat actors looking to you

460
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:36,660
know uncover zero days and uh access

461
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,480
Brokers you know using uh end days and

462
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,540
and you know selling access to lists of

463
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,120
products that are vulnerable to zero

464
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,300
days as well and on end days as well

465
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,760
so another thing the in the Conti leaks

466
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,639
in June 2021 someone actually joined the

467
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:56,880
uh the Conti leaks uh chat

468
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,220
and someone actually received

469
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,139
information that they have a zero like a

470
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:03,480
zero data privately sell to the group

471
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,260
um

472
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,899
and and you know this was a zero day LP

473
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:09,720
in one of the Microsoft Windows drivers

474
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,519
um I actually sent this to Microsoft and

475
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,560
they said that uh all even though all

476
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,540
the versions are listed there

477
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,399
they actually said that not all of them

478
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:20,279
were patched so so that was quite good

479
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,500
to let them know that uh you know zero

480
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,160
day's still going around

481
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,680
um another thing uh one of the more

482
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,120
important parts of vulnerability

483
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,680
intelligence is trying to figure out

484
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,300
who's actually exploiting what and why

485
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,579
so advanced persistent threat groups so

486
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,019
kind of some of the things that you know

487
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:39,420
keep csos awake at night but

488
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,399
yeah you can definitely break down the

489
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:42,899
characteristics based on on who's

490
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:45,120
actually doing what so I said here North

491
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,860
Korea tries to steal zero days from

492
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,420
researchers

493
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,100
um China actually recruits exploit

494
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,600
developers from tampu cup which I

495
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,519
covered earlier uh Russia has been known

496
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,079
to hire Private Industry experts like

497
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:56,579
positive Technologies which has been

498
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:59,639
sanctioned by the treasury Iran will

499
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:01,620
actually opportunistically exploit

500
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,020
critical cves so

501
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,240
basically whenever a news whenever a new

502
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,400
vulnerability comes out you know there

503
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,720
are obviously some of the first to

504
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,919
actually go after it and

505
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:12,599
opportunistically take advantage before

506
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,459
people have actually had time to patch

507
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:17,099
uh India and South Korea where last year

508
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:19,020
it was revealed that they hired a U.S

509
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,559
firm uh Exodus intelligence and and

510
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:24,240
purchased zero days off of them uh

511
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,919
Western intelligence Partners actually

512
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,079
often also partner with commercial zero

513
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,179
day Brokers so xerodium

514
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:32,520
and then you have Saudi Arabia and the

515
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,799
UAE how I hire Israelis by our companies

516
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,620
like NSO group and then as well as the

517
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,480
sort of uh African countries Egypt

518
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,120
Nigeria Sudan also do the same sort of

519
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,980
thing from the Italian

520
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,140
um zero day company a zero day broker

521
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,480
hacking team

522
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,820
so this is an example of North Korea

523
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,039
trying to steal zero days they created

524
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,440
multiple social media accounts and then

525
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,000
they would message you on Twitter and

526
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,980
ask you if you want to collaborate on

527
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,360
every zero day research and they'd

528
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,400
actually send you a back door and try

529
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,240
and steal it off your computer

530
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,080
China

531
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,460
some of the examples of vulnerabilities

532
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,580
exploited by China all of these

533
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,900
if you've noticed if you can notice

534
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,640
anything about some of these they're all

535
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,280
initial access vulnerabilities so as so

536
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,380
as soon as like I was saying with the

537
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,320
tmfu cup and uh you know the private

538
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,559
private vulnerability uh industry

539
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:27,960
the Chinese actually are working with

540
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,760
the intelligence services to be able to

541
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,220
uh you know be able to establish a

542
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,919
foothold inside a Target organization so

543
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:36,120
they will scan basically scan your

544
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,799
perimeter figure out what you have and

545
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,179
then they will develop a zero day to

546
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:41,480
break in

547
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,880
Russia although they do the same kind of

548
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,260
thing as China and Iran opportunity

549
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,539
opportunistically exploiting things

550
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:50,700
um Russia is the Russian government and

551
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,200
the intelligence services are more

552
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,480
likely to uh they're sort of the only

553
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,940
ones currently developing exploits for

554
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,400
uh industrial Control Systems so you

555
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,200
have the soundwam team the Russian

556
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,020
Russian intelligence director at the gru

557
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,179
actually developed

558
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:06,720
um

559
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,820
you know sort of exploits a denial of

560
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,740
service to vulnerabilities for ICS

561
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,400
equipment in the Siemens uh cyprotech to

562
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,260
basically take down a Ukrainian

563
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,080
electrical power station in 2016 and

564
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,600
then in 2017 you had the xenotine group

565
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,640
which is the you know the Russian

566
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,460
Federation Research Institute

567
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,620
actually developed an exploit in the

568
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:31,320
Schneider Electric tricone X tricon to

569
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,880
be able to disable the sensor to

570
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,679
actually take down a petrochemical plant

571
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:37,200
in Saudi Arabia and then more recently

572
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,740
in 2022 dragos and mandian actually

573
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:44,640
managed to identify a malware called in

574
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,860
controller or or

575
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,080
was that pipe pipe dream

576
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,299
and it's actually had a vulnerability in

577
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:53,340
it in a as rock motherboards to be able

578
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:57,240
to disable uh human machine interfaces

579
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,400
and it was apparently used against the

580
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,400
U.S gas pipeline but uh it's kind of

581
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,820
still a bit of a mystery on that one

582
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,500
um the advanced persistent threats in

583
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,020
Iran the advanced position threat groups

584
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,240
in Iran are you know they as I said

585
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,740
earlier the opportunistically exploit

586
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,200
vulnerabilities they you know the IRG

587
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,380
irgc was exploiting fortunate vpns to be

588
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,720
able to gain initial access inside the

589
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,280
healthcare networks and they'd use that

590
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,260
to uh you know deploy ransomware against

591
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,720
hospitals and things like that

592
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,380
um again they went after log4j and again

593
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:31,980
um

594
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,380
they you know use it to establish an

595
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:38,100
initial access and move around laterally

596
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,020
and in September 22 the five eyes

597
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,240
intelligence Community actually uh sort

598
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,400
of disclosed and presented their sort of

599
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,200
tactics techniques and procedures and it

600
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,820
was very interesting to see you know the

601
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,640
US Canada UK Australia all come together

602
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,220
and say you know confirm we saw around

603
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,260
doing this

604
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,460
so

605
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,679
key tools and resources I've covered a

606
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:00,840
few of them already we have you know

607
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,280
Twitter the sister Kev catalog Showdown

608
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,200
um you know attack a knowledge base and

609
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,419
this is quite a good one the cve trans

610
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:11,220
website you can actually use all of

611
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,380
these to be basically track

612
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,799
vulnerabilities exploded in the wild

613
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,020
uh so four key lessons vulnerability

614
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,940
intelligence requires a broad knowledge

615
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,320
of products in the tech stack to be able

616
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,660
to do effectively uh it recommend I

617
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,520
recommend uh you know to prioritize

618
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,500
attack surface monitoring because you

619
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,580
know the attackers are scanning you

620
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,380
trying to profile your organization try

621
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,340
and figure out what products you're

622
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,419
using

623
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:35,280
um to then as soon as when a you know a

624
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,960
new exploit comes out they can

625
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,640
immediately get in if you know you're

626
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,200
basically in a Race Against Time against

627
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,220
them

628
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,380
and it requires vigilance and monitoring

629
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,120
of multiple multiple types of sources as

630
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,559
I said earlier you want to be able to

631
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,480
monitor trust groups you want to be able

632
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,799
to monitor

633
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:52,860
um you know open source news websites of

634
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,320
of you know attacks uh whether they got

635
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,539
in by this way or the other you

636
00:21:57,539 --> 00:21:58,919
basically want to figure out you know

637
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:00,539
which products are being exploited

638
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:02,280
currently and if you're affected by them

639
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,080
or not and I also recommend creating a

640
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,460
run book to deal with a new critical

641
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,720
vulnerability

642
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,919
um you know it's very important to

643
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,539
practice these as well

644
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:11,820
because you know at some point maybe a

645
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,039
product you use uh across your entire

646
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:16,440
Edge suddenly a new vulnerability comes

647
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,299
out tonight so what's your plan to do it

648
00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:19,980
deal with it

649
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,440
and yeah thank you very much for

650
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,080
watching and uh left a little bit of

651
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,600
time for a question or two so uh yeah I

652
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,320
hope everyone enjoyed

653
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:40,049
[Applause]
