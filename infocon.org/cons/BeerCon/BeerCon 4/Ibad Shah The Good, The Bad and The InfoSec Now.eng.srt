1
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,580
thank you thank you so much for joining

2
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,079
my for joining this uh talk and uh thank

3
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,460
you again uh for giving up your time so

4
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,560
uh we're just going to discuss a bit

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,199
good about how the infosec as a

6
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,599
community is what what are the things

7
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,320
that were really fascinating and how it

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,219
makes Android community and uh who are

9
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:36,600
some of the challenges and stuff like

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,540
that with the infosight right now

11
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,120
um so yeah

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,640
I have a person who lives in uh pretty

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,620
much known to the community before like

14
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,860
back in 2019 2018 I wasn't even though

15
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,980
but I wasn't even sure if I would be

16
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,020
able to make it to this point but then

17
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,579
it's on because of the community I stand

18
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:01,760
and uh

19
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,820
so uh when we say emphasize as a

20
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,180
security industry uh some some think of

21
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,720
it as uh with the perspective of like in

22
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,020
it's into how empty class or maybe a

23
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,000
handful because

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,400
um some of uh some of the critiques

25
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,259
about infra security infused ideas and

26
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:24,180
industries like are there a lot of

27
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,740
challenges for the people to get into

28
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,960
the community which includes uh the kl1

29
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,840
theories it's like game keeping a lack

30
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,840
of knowledge and people and making lack

31
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,600
of this I mean uh not actually being

32
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,119
sharing the kind of things for the

33
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,060
people who want to join in the community

34
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,439
who want to contribute or who are

35
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,299
looking for mentors and mentees so that

36
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:46,920
you know they're creating kind of

37
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,780
relationship but then there are some

38
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,520
good side of this info security and

39
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,860
industries because

40
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,720
um if you are coming from a background

41
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,659
who's been a developer uh you can just

42
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,780
you know be very very easy you feel very

43
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,700
easy to get into the community by

44
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,500
understanding the logic said

45
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,719
understanding what is happening at the

46
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,979
back right and then you can you know uh

47
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:13,319
try to mold yourself in a way that you

48
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:15,420
understand security so it's not

49
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,540
something that I would consider one of

50
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,239
the best industry because uh there's

51
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:23,160
always ups and downs and girls always

52
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,459
change your opinions uh you might get

53
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:27,900
disagreement with a lot of people

54
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,239
somebody would someone somebody might

55
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,819
agree with you somebody will try to pull

56
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,379
you down but then at the end of the day

57
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:37,140
there are people who support you

58
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,420
um so obviously it all starts with the

59
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,940
dialogue

60
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,400
communicating with the people around you

61
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,019
uh with the people you approach for help

62
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:48,480
and stuff like that because

63
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,480
um that's how the human nature is Right

64
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,239
sometimes we don't tend to ask for help

65
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,700
or maybe ask for kind of support that we

66
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,280
require but it's it's really important

67
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,760
to be one of those people uh because

68
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,920
that's how actually we can overcome our

69
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,640
fears or things like imposter syndrome

70
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,379
because

71
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:12,659
um some some of us might look for

72
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,640
validation of what we do in the

73
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,620
community or what we do in the industry

74
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,180
and some won't even

75
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,739
look for those validations and they will

76
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:24,720
continue to do the good work at the good

77
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,239
job they do but then it's always good to

78
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:30,540
have someone to listen to you or to hear

79
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,300
your opinions have that discussion with

80
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,159
stuff like that but then there are

81
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:37,140
people who are making their in the

82
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,940
shadows and they've been never

83
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,680
highlighted or they have been never been

84
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,220
someone uh being discussed more

85
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,739
frequently investors in the industry so

86
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:48,840
I have a story to share and it's really

87
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,940
nice and it's really fascinating which

88
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,140
is like

89
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,900
when I started in this security domain

90
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,480
specifically like in early ages a

91
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,400
teenager that growing up

92
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,620
um I used to follow a lot of uh stuff

93
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,980
that was available on that right so

94
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,299
there was a lot of stuff that was paid

95
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:09,120
obviously I was seeing like most of you

96
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,519
or maybe some some of them and some of

97
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,080
you have already gone through that stage

98
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,540
didn't have enough uh funds to support

99
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,760
myself and then

100
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,620
um there were some video YouTube kind of

101
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,100
channels that were actually uh sort of

102
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,160
helping me with that skill set right so

103
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,520
I came across this YouTube channel and

104
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,139
although it was a YouTube channel it was

105
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:37,080
a different website uh who was something

106
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,680
like very specific to security uh and

107
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,800
there is a new term called buffalo

108
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,180
everyone was really fascinating for me

109
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,820
at that time right and I really wanted

110
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,100
to learn more about that and the more I

111
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,759
try to explore the content was posted on

112
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,120
that video Forum the more I got

113
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,160
interested in all of that stuff that was

114
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,919
being done at the back right I mean when

115
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,139
it comes to information security and uh

116
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:06,300
in technical perspective

117
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,259
um but then when I uh sort of started

118
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:13,020
searching about the person

119
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,360
um that was that was really a

120
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,120
fascinating story to hear and that was

121
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,840
really I mean absolutely inspiring so so

122
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,940
he is pretty much now for the

123
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:33,300
contribution to the community by posting

124
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,440
uh videos and tutorials and you know all

125
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,100
of that on his website called security

126
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,620
and then he started his own a training

127
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,840
company which was recently been acquired

128
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,120
by another training company of training

129
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,120
and signification Company this is the

130
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,100
room where he used to set up his

131
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,900
environment that he used to you know in

132
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,360
the color of the videos and you can see

133
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,780
how uh how if there's no proper Studio

134
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,020
or there's no proper sort of you know uh

135
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,800
setup that has been you know uh placed

136
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,380
over there for him do you know record

137
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,479
all of those videos and do all of the

138
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,020
stuff that people usually do but now he

139
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:19,919
is training uh every sector that is

140
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,900
actively working in the information

141
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,520
technology that's

142
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,659
it can be

143
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,919
anything you need and the guy has really

144
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,080
made his name out of everything

145
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,360
which is because

146
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,020
he made that contribution in the shadows

147
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,120
even though nobody was actually

148
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,419
recognizing recognizing for whatever he

149
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:48,240
was contributing to the community yet he

150
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,220
is standing right now and now people

151
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,479
agree with it for don't work uh and the

152
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,000
job is done

153
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,100
so next up I have a really another

154
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,100
interesting story of how actually the

155
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,800
community supports each other and then

156
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,039
you know overcoming to the point of like

157
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:10,440
you know uh when we look for someone

158
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,440
first for that kind of support and once

159
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,199
you get that I mean this is an extra arm

160
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,880
you think that some

161
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,220
some of them will really enjoy and some

162
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,740
people really think of it like if I mean

163
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,440
this can actually happen as well uh so

164
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,300
that's not my computer being had that's

165
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,539
a screenshot uh earlier uh from uh from

166
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:32,880
a ransom but I want to cry but it was

167
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,800
like

168
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,380
uh most of the hospitals in the UK were

169
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,419
badly infected I mean you know

170
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:42,000
everything was uh turned upside down

171
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,660
because of this specific uh rank support

172
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,360
so uh

173
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,360
I was just checking my chat maybe I just

174
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,639
got some messages from both just to make

175
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,680
sure I don't ignore them but anyway

176
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,220
um did I mean uh this ransomware had

177
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,520
actually been created what kind of uh a

178
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,740
devastating effect a devastating

179
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,099
situation for every everyone around the

180
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:10,380
world that can be any industry like

181
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,560
maybe there are countries that had not

182
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,199
much of the identity infrastructure in

183
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:18,960
their in their organization but that got

184
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,900
him with this Rancho food and it was

185
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,400
taking wow

186
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,160
but then the beautiful part of this

187
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,240
industry is we always introspect and we

188
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,000
always look for things like peace and we

189
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,580
always look for

190
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:39,659
helping uh the industry as a whole uh in

191
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,520
such crucial paths right

192
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,458
and so

193
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:46,680
there was a researcher from the UK again

194
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,120
uh

195
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,019
uh he got a snippet of the malware like

196
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:53,880
if snippet can be a kind of quote that

197
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,300
was executed on uh on the computers that

198
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,180
were getting infected and what did

199
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,940
Stephen was looking was a kind of the

200
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,120
way that needs to be registered

201
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,580
and once he registered them to me

202
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,060
the malware was or the ransomware was

203
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,899
deactivated and from every uh computer

204
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:17,519
that was affected

205
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,440
and that's the guy uh Marcus uh one of

206
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,320
the great great uh

207
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,540
I would say hackers who had actually had

208
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:33,120
the global uh

209
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,880
I mean his contribution was something

210
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,360
like helping

211
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:43,459
the world together you know this

212
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,220
anyways so his contribution actually

213
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,580
created kind of impact which is like the

214
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,620
malware of the dinosaur was deactivated

215
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,800
from everywhere from every computer but

216
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,700
then

217
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,800
what happens next

218
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,480
uh

219
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,920
uh he's raising in Vegas for Defcon uh

220
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,459
and just enjoying their uh with a lot of

221
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:13,040
friends and folks

222
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,800
and then uh when he's when he's flying

223
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,060
back to England uh he's been arrested

224
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:24,360
and everybody is kind of uh shocked with

225
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,060
this news and the moment this year the

226
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,060
news was broken uh on Twitter or

227
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,440
anywhere

228
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,959
um it spread like

229
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:36,360
anything you could imagine right

230
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,060
but then the same Community came up and

231
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:44,040
then helped him you know uh to get over

232
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,680
the difficult phase of his life which

233
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,940
was uh being arrested and then uh

234
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,160
putting that putting him in jail maybe

235
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,440
not putting in jail but maybe like uh

236
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,740
signs upon for her name's Bond and then

237
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,740
you know all of that stuff had including

238
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:06,240
specifically uh for Marcus uh and then

239
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,100
after a lot of years of efforts he got

240
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,800
free and just because he did something

241
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,380
in the past which was something really

242
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,360
bad

243
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,279
uh he was being arrested for that

244
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,380
specific case

245
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,180
but hesitate

246
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:27,959
the man changed the entire history for

247
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,899
humankind uh when the transmitter had

248
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,220
attacked

249
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,519
and the judge that made a decision on

250
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,440
Marcus

251
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,560
uh made it really clear in the verdict

252
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,760
everything

253
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,260
uh he turned the corner

254
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,300
and

255
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,600
sometimes uh something that we did in

256
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,620
past

257
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,160
might be something wrong but then

258
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:01,200
he made that uh sort of effort

259
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,000
to make this world a better place

260
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:09,600
so

261
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,880
there's a fun story that was involved

262
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,700
that involves me as well in one of the

263
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,980
incidents like uh I was doing some

264
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,260
research on my on a lot of projects and

265
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,940
I was just learning

266
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,360
how things can you know I mean finding

267
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,820
bugs and probabilities and stuff like

268
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,120
that so I found this uh electron item

269
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,820
system it had this plumbing code or

270
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,180
vulnerable code within their application

271
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:40,019
and what I did was uh I sort of create a

272
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:41,880
kind of exponent code for that and then

273
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,820
I tried to I reported that to him I know

274
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,040
that they didn't respond back to it but

275
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,899
then what happened was

276
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:52,139
um I responsibly disclosed it by

277
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:54,060
creating kind of expert for that so that

278
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,540
uh someone who understands how the logic

279
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,700
Works can you know try to figure out how

280
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,800
uh the expired works and then they can

281
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,839
pass their system support because it was

282
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,339
an open source normal application right

283
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:07,800
and then

284
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,019
um it's not something very complicated

285
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:11,940
like you need to build something from

286
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,620
scratch and then compile it and then

287
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,720
publish it but it's more like and get

288
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,180
into the specific area of the code fix

289
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,000
it and then it's all done

290
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,620
so while I did that contribution

291
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,820
someone stole my exploit code

292
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:34,620
and reported it to uh CNA for a CV and

293
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,480
then publish it something like their own

294
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,740
work right

295
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,339
and make it look like this was entirely

296
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:44,639
their project and entirely what they

297
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:45,540
were doing

298
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,339
and

299
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:49,440
it was a company it was not an

300
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,360
individual it was a company that was

301
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,120
doing that and I reached out to them a

302
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,579
lot of times I still don't want to take

303
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:59,339
their name because I respect their I

304
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,920
want to make uh maintain the

305
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,360
confidential

306
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,920
but then obviously that got Stone

307
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,019
and just because I didn't know how to

308
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:12,560
file a CDE let's say

309
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,880
because I wasn't pretty much aware of

310
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,339
the fact that there is something called

311
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:18,839
uh

312
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:21,779
that that thing happened

313
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:23,880
but the good part is

314
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,760
there's a platform called tryhat

315
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,740
they actually created a kind of

316
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,120
environment introduced this

317
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,579
kind of saving products you can say like

318
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:37,980
uh deliberately creating a kind of one

319
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,540
of the machine for the students so that

320
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,160
they can learn from it

321
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,260
and when they were creating those

322
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,940
environment then introduced the same

323
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,519
vulnerability and what happened was uh

324
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:53,100
all of the uh folks who were actually

325
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,160
exploring this uh machine or this

326
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,199
environment just to get some Landing out

327
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:02,880
of it we're using uh the exploited

328
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,300
so one way or another my contribution

329
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:10,740
was actually being recognized by folks

330
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,300
who are actually working on this machine

331
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,600
and I'm glad they did that because that

332
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,940
way actually they learn

333
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,120
how exploits work and I've seen a lot of

334
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,820
comments which says uh they had to

335
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,160
change some they had to modify some of

336
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,300
the following Index right

337
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:32,399
which is a great idea and that's how

338
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,139
contribution works and that's how

339
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:36,300
Community works contribution you

340
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,519
contribute you say together you learn

341
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,260
from your mistakes you learn from what

342
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,540
you have done or if you try to adopt

343
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,079
anything that is new and an improved

344
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,220
version of and then your words right

345
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:53,399
and so there was a really specific point

346
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:56,279
in my life which changed the entire

347
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:58,079
course of my life for the next three

348
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,500
years which was like code hit really

349
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,820
hard Across the Universe

350
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:08,940
because I'm not sure uh the aliens are

351
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,519
actually affected anyways

352
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,920
um everyone at this uh in in This Global

353
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,380
Community I would say a world but don't

354
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,519
want to be because anyone who's

355
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:21,920
connected

356
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,360
uh really got affected with this

357
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,000
lockdown or what would you say when we

358
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,560
call it this current situation

359
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:41,220
situation and that was really bad

360
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:45,839
because uh we as a human are sometimes

361
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,440
not pretty much okay being stuck at a

362
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,860
point of being forced to sit or forced

363
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,440
to be in the position rather we move

364
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,139
around and look for things there can be

365
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:00,240
different situations and it depends from

366
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,339
a person's person right

367
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:06,959
but then this has been and Ben has been

368
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,260
doing uh a lot of community work

369
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,619
um and then uh he was being invited by

370
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:16,260
one of the major universities in the UK

371
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,839
to speak on something I'm not sure what

372
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,299
was that but then if he did a great job

373
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:24,059
depictions

374
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:26,699
on screen

375
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:29,940
from the folks who as Mike had mentioned

376
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,520
earlier a word from infosight happy hour

377
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,220
and one episode was

378
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,620
it was all just individuals from

379
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,840
different Continental different

380
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,320
um uh races from different religion we

381
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,020
didn't care about that what we did was

382
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,200
we used to sit together enjoy drinks

383
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,140
discuss topics things to improve and

384
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,700
what we can do to improve this community

385
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,179
and then ask for suggestions so that was

386
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:03,960
exactly my point you know uh asked for

387
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,840
suggestions ask for recommendations ask

388
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,720
for what I can what I can do upscale

389
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,419
myself or improve myself as a better

390
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:15,440
human because

391
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:19,020
of profession and I'm really honest with

392
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,419
you at this point uh I wasn't even

393
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:23,940
thrilled with my language I'm speaking

394
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,160
yes English I wasn't too much food but

395
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,120
that

396
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,039
I used to

397
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,900
sort of stuck or in sort of uh take a

398
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,240
lot of time to comprehend what I was

399
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,520
thinking and then giving it a kind of my

400
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,400
words but it all happened because I was

401
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,740
given that confidence by the community I

402
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,080
was given that support by the community

403
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,020
and what next happened

404
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:51,840
uh I spoke to a lot of folks like my

405
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,679
name is one of them who calls uh Ian as

406
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,799
well sometimes and I did my first talk

407
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,500
at Defcon safe because Defcon was not

408
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,600
actually happening and then that was one

409
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,580
of my opportunities to grab I mean

410
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,440
obviously I was a kind of person who

411
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,799
cannot actually go into Vegas because

412
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:12,960
it's pretty expensive for a person who's

413
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,960
living across the union across the uh

414
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,480
continents to book a flight and then it

415
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,400
means a lot of that processes but this

416
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,799
was my opportunity right and I grabbed

417
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,059
them

418
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:25,679
okay

419
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,419
but then

420
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:31,080
you just actually helped me uh to kind

421
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,280
of do a lot of more money disclosures

422
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,440
and I picked a side game which is people

423
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,179
call it the body

424
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,039
and I made a good amount of money out of

425
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,020
it sometimes right now I cannot because

426
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:46,260
I mean obviously there's a lot of uh

427
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,360
constraints right now cannot do that and

428
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,980
there's a lot of you know time that you

429
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,280
need to uh give it but then

430
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,380
it was great because

431
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,940
I got a lot of help from you

432
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:04,459
with them

433
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,179
but then

434
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:07,860
there was another project I was working

435
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,539
on since 2019

436
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:11,400
and I mentioned that earlier as well in

437
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,600
my thought

438
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,679
and in 2021 I was invited to speak at

439
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:19,280
one of the

440
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,559
um called his blackhead and

441
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,140
I would never have imagined that

442
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,400
and

443
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,679
when I say that I'm I get really

444
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:31,140
emotional for the fact that I could have

445
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:34,080
better imagine to be someone standing up

446
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,900
there and discussing my research with

447
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,440
with people that really I'm looking

448
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,960
forward to it and during really being

449
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,539
there to listen to my research and this

450
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:47,640
all happened because

451
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,700
it's it's it's the help that I asked for

452
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,280
it's the support that I ask for and it's

453
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,980
the country that I had

454
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:59,039
but then at one point of time uh the

455
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,600
negativity will actually hit you hard as

456
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,840
well so most of the folks uh would

457
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,460
actually know that I run a local

458
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,980
community and then there was a gig that

459
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:11,220
I was organizing for the first time and

460
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,500
there are some point conversations that

461
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,900
were that took place but it was not

462
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,220
something like

463
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,799
that was deliberately great known by me

464
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:24,320
or by others but it was more like

465
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:27,059
we were running again for the first time

466
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:29,820
we didn't have any experience with that

467
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:33,539
but again who came back to the rescue

468
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:36,059
the same community

469
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:38,640
and I thank them I'll understand for

470
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,780
this

471
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:43,080
so uh uh when we say information

472
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,940
security and infrastruct is the best

473
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,620
industry

474
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,559
I have no objectives to elaborate that

475
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:52,080
because we are constantly questioning

476
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,960
each other we are constantly asking for

477
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,940
foundations we're constantly looking

478
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,820
forward to that specific advice from

479
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,120
people that can be anyone from from from

480
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,900
any person from anyone across the globe

481
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,600
because we need that sometimes we need

482
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,720
those validations and it's okay

483
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,880
we have a respective respect for the

484
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,200
millions of these agreements because

485
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,559
when we discuss stuff there are some

486
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:22,520
points and there are some uh opinions

487
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:28,080
that may can be accepted by someone and

488
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,220
we can secrete yourself

489
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:36,020
so with that uh

490
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,820
but anyways I'm just writing but

491
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,740
um so with all of these conscious

492
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,480
agreements and disagreements we get more

493
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,280
room of improvements because when

494
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,320
someone questions mean or someone

495
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,020
questions like this is something uh not

496
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,520
the right way of doing it you can do it

497
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,320
this way

498
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,500
we improve ourselves and then yeah at

499
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,960
the end of it we get our imposter

500
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,000
syndrome which is really really

501
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,640
important for us

502
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,159
and it will evolve constantly

503
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:15,200
because that's how the community is

504
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,200
and if somebody says

505
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,900
don't follow that just give them the

506
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,919
shut up

507
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:25,700
thanks so much

508
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:39,539
apologies for the hot mic that was

509
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:41,820
kicking around in this in the uh the

510
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,440
venue there but we could hear you anyway

511
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,419
so everything was fine

512
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:47,100
um and appreciate the shout outs to

513
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,600
their farmers and to everybody in the

514
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,340
community because we have particular

515
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,159
during the the dark times of the

516
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:55,320
pandemic we really did come together and

517
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,940
I think a lot of people made lifelong

518
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,380
friendships and I think that's a really

519
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,840
wonderful thing to happen really so yeah

520
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,340
props to you

521
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,740
um and thanks for your talk so all the

522
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,299
best and enjoy the rest of your stay in

523
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:08,480
Canada
