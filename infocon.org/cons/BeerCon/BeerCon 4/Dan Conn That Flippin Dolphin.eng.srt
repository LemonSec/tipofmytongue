thank you

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:03,959
wow

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:05,279
it's like being uh it's like being

4
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,140
Madonna with one of these it's great

5
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,000
um anyway

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,160
um my name is Dan con I'm now a

7
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,860
developer advocate for sonotype the

8
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,199
company do lots of really cool things

9
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:17,220
um I've only been there a week and

10
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,359
that's what I'm actually meant to do I

11
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,400
don't know yet anyhow I'm not talking

12
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,260
about any of that what I'm talking about

13
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,779
is uh basically something that's kind of

14
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:26,519
a cute little toy

15
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,260
but also actually something's quite

16
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,900
dangerous in some ways it's called the

17
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,120
flippers hero that flipping dolphin

18
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,700
foreign

19
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,820
helps if you press the space bar right

20
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:42,899
anyway

21
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:45,420
they called it flipper

22
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,399
won your heart everyone remember the

23
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,320
song you know from the older 70s thing

24
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,719
you know flip the color no we're not

25
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,820
really interesting okay no worries well

26
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,920
that's such it I mean look who could say

27
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,980
no to a face like that right

28
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,719
what it is it's a really good hacking

29
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,280
tool essentially

30
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,319
it could you know it has many Tools in

31
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,360
one it's like a Swiss army knife of

32
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,100
packing

33
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,900
kind of wrapped around a Tamagotchi

34
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,580
anyone old enough to remember

35
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,220
Tamagotchis yeah you're my people that's

36
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,640
great yes we're all no yeah so basically

37
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,500
you know it kind of

38
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,659
reacts to two things one hacking two

39
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:24,140
games

40
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,360
when you turn it off you get a sad face

41
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,619
like it's literally like you're gonna

42
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:30,979
kill it

43
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,180
cries

44
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,220
so I think this is the main thing you

45
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,900
can't turn it off you want to wander

46
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,040
around you want to capture things with

47
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,200
it what actually is it though I'm you

48
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,320
know

49
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,100
no I'm not going to say what that is

50
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,140
we're going to do a warning first so

51
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,780
looks like a lovely friendly dolphin but

52
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,759
it looks like a toy it looks like it can

53
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,320
be a lot of fun and it is a lot of fun

54
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,420
but

55
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,520
anything you see just make sure you get

56
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,020
permission from an owner because

57
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,240
actually that's illegal and uh we don't

58
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,520
like criminals it's really bad

59
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,960
so with that in mind how could something

60
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,240
so criminal be so good well because

61
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,160
it's not criminal it's just the

62
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,739
activities you're doing so what is the

63
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:12,000
flipper zero

64
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,860
it's a hacking tool

65
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,800
but also a Tamagotchi style dolphin and

66
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,300
it looks like fun

67
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,280
and it is but you will get into trouble

68
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,300
if you don't get permission so

69
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,440
definitely do

70
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,000
what does it actually do well

71
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,180
essentially it listens into things so

72
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,000
what you do is you have your flipper you

73
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,640
listen to a certain signal which is

74
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,560
activated where you know whatever that

75
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,540
might be rifid tags are a great example

76
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,959
radio signals QR codes

77
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,700
um what other scans could do you can

78
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,959
attach it to the different developer

79
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,019
boxes so if we see here that's the oh I

80
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:48,200
didn't know is there that's the Wi-Fi

81
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,400
module which you can actually use

82
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,500
something called Marauder

83
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,000
don't get caught

84
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,239
um and uh basically that you know it can

85
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:00,000
use sort of different uh access Keys

86
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,739
um you know that's essentially what you

87
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:03,959
do so it's you can also use it for

88
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:06,599
fuzzing flashing firmware

89
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,879
the sky is really the limit anything you

90
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,159
can listen into replay get that

91
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,720
information and use it that's what you

92
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,640
can use it for

93
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,200
and yeah you know Wi-Fi connectivity so

94
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,940
do what you will with that but

95
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,620
definitely get permission of the owner

96
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,840
of the network not just necessarily your

97
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,459
your thing

98
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:27,420
um

99
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,060
what's in The Flipper zero you have a

100
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,519
sub two gigahertz sub scanner

101
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:35,099
you have a riffid scanner uh you have an

102
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:37,200
infrared capture

103
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,120
you do have an SQ card slot and that's

104
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,280
actually for an expansion pack

105
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,319
um the really weird thing

106
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:46,440
is essentially

107
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,420
so

108
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,400
when you read that documentation you

109
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,200
basically have an SD card and it says

110
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,580
you don't need an SD card you've got

111
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,860
plenty of memory now that's the memory

112
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,220
you get given 72 kilobytes free after

113
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,739
you load it up and you can't really do a

114
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:03,599
lot of 70 gigabytes in fact when you try

115
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,799
and

116
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,959
for the first time do a firmware update

117
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,780
it just says put an SD card in don't be

118
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,620
stupid like so there's very little you

119
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,720
can do without that SD card

120
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,298
um it takes a 32 gig one the more you

121
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:19,620
capture the more you're going to need to

122
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,120
store it

123
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,800
um

124
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,479
should you store it for long term I mean

125
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,100
that's up to you really

126
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,900
should you know you might be mucking

127
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,520
around with your mates

128
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,100
is that good I don't know depends if you

129
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,060
mates won't need to store their stuff

130
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,620
indefatitely doesn't it

131
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,500
so it is a lot of fun

132
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,940
how's it yeah and there's lots of

133
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,720
interesting Tech within it but yeah

134
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,940
dolphins are danger it is fun it's lots

135
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,759
of fun and this is a problem right

136
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,160
one thing that I've kind of learned is

137
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,600
like I've got

138
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,060
um relatives who have no idea about

139
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,220
cyber security whatsoever but they've

140
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,740
heard of this and they love it because

141
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,780
it's like oh my God like I could do all

142
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,220
this stuff right and the problem with

143
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,259
that is that they don't actually know

144
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:06,780
like everyone here knows about the

145
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,660
computer misuse act right yeah cool you

146
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,040
know that if you don't get permission

147
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,020
you could actually end up in prison

148
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,780
right it's not joking whereas they don't

149
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,860
they just think I know what I'm going to

150
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,300
knock around with weights and I'm gonna

151
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,040
do their Tesla you know I mean that's

152
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,720
that's the thing as well Tesla cars

153
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,180
right it's been known to kind of you can

154
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,100
hack them you can hack older cars that

155
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,860
don't have any kind of locking

156
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,900
um rotation so you know you can actually

157
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,600
get into those I remember I think um I

158
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,039
think Bill nessler was saying about uh

159
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,440
keyless go on the original Mercedes I

160
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,360
worked for Mercedes at that time as just

161
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,060
in the car garage nothing fancy but

162
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,520
um you had like stories of people that

163
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,800
had kind of like gone to like eat in a

164
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,380
in a like Diner and then like see their

165
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,320
car go off before a flipper zero existed

166
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,479
just because they you know they would

167
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,340
with their key fob in their pocket and

168
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,539
it was just within range and they could

169
00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:00,060
just drive down the road great right

170
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,220
and then they couldn't say well we want

171
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,500
to stop it because you're already on the

172
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,780
motorway it's really bad to stop a car

173
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,479
with this Midway right so you just you

174
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:11,780
know that's a lot of these things have

175
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,740
consequences I guess that's what I'm

176
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,600
trying to say and I say my my relative

177
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,880
he's like he can't wait to use this so

178
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,560
they'd say you do know that this is

179
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,139
really wrong right and it's like no

180
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:24,060
no why would you right

181
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,199
yeah so I think that's just something

182
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,360
that we need to kind of be aware of and

183
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,979
probably say a lot more

184
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:30,600
but

185
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,639
oh

186
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,479
I'm missing a lot of slides anyway so

187
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,400
what the main thing let's go back to

188
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,419
this one then

189
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:41,039
so

190
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,440
what fun things can you do with it

191
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,440
sub two and a half gig scanner that's a

192
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,600
lot of radio waves right

193
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,080
you can you know set off car doors

194
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,060
uh you can open and close them you can

195
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,620
open and close your neighbors

196
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,000
with their permission

197
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,560
or not with affirmation I mean this is

198
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,759
this is the thing right it's up to you

199
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,380
what you do

200
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,380
um one thing I quite liked was I went to

201
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,520
a festival

202
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,160
and I kind of scabbed my my entry

203
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,199
and then wondered if I could double scan

204
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,460
it

205
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,080
um which it did kind of work but I don't

206
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,000
know whether like I kind of thought

207
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,380
about it's like oh my God is that a hack

208
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,539
and then realized probably not

209
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:20,099
they know that I'm already in there so

210
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:21,900
it's a bit pointless so it's I think

211
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,979
with a lot of these things it's kind of

212
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:24,479
you got to think about the use case I

213
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,880
think like

214
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,039
you know I think it's quite good if you

215
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,240
can kind of highlight it to companies

216
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,919
maybe and use it as a tool to say well

217
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,780
look this is what I found with it

218
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,180
can I kind of extend it a bit further to

219
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,580
see you know for example an entry system

220
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,560
for a festival if you are already

221
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,139
scanned in and then somebody else can

222
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:45,660
use your you know you scan your your if

223
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,039
it tag you maybe copy that to somebody

224
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,440
else they come up with their phone they

225
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,539
scan it there do they let get in for

226
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:52,620
free

227
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,840
uh there was actually a festival called

228
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,599
Block in 2012 where

229
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,000
essentially they used QR codes and

230
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,500
scanners for you know quite a lot of

231
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,660
digital entry systems you see now uh the

232
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,460
company that did it they didn't really

233
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,380
think about sequential

234
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:11,400
uh rolling uh tickets so someone just

235
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,259
randomly and the QR code was essentially

236
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:16,380
just the serial number so if you're in a

237
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,180
group of 10 Lads one person bought a

238
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,340
ticket nine million free and that had a

239
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,560
huge problem they had Snoop Dog play

240
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,840
there to an almost overcrowded venue the

241
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,199
actual uh it was at London city

242
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:30,419
um the whole place got shut down uh it's

243
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:31,740
quite horrific

244
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,299
um somebody I know was doing security

245
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:35,580
there they nearly got rocks thrown at

246
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,640
them really really bad

247
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,919
um so that's kind of like

248
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,899
I guess an example of The Flipper zero

249
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:45,600
when it's used for bad you know but also

250
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,940
is it really the Flipper's fault is it

251
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,740
really your fault

252
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,600
is it actually the thought of developers

253
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,160
that don't actually think of these

254
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,899
things and this is me saying it as a

255
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:57,420
developer and a developer Advocate now

256
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,640
um you know if you if you can break into

257
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,080
a car

258
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,140
is that the full of the technology or is

259
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,420
this actually highlighting an issue to

260
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,640
say I know what

261
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,920
I shouldn't be able to do this what you

262
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,560
should be able to do is go through

263
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,779
roller you know roll roll on the key so

264
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:18,180
that this doesn't actually happen if I

265
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,880
can get into a festival for free

266
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,880
that's on you as your security policies

267
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,620
it's not really on me as you know

268
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,440
checking it out and I think I guess with

269
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,940
the update of the CMA that's happening

270
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,279
now that's maybe something that you know

271
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:35,279
on the one hand you have the flipper

272
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,680
which essentially is

273
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,420
oh my God that's dangerous and then you

274
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,860
have on the other hand well people

275
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,120
should be able to test these scenes

276
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,080
because actually we end up with a much

277
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,820
better life because of it

278
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,680
and it's finding that happy medium do

279
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,760
you do you want people getting in for

280
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,019
free festivals probably not the festival

281
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:52,080
go under do you want people to use

282
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,839
technology wisely yes and I think that's

283
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:57,240
an important thing maybe

284
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,220
so

285
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,200
this is the other thing

286
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,060
look at this tool look the other half

287
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,399
was meant to be saying oh look these are

288
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,839
all the ways that you can be safe and

289
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:07,980
kind of

290
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,360
really through it there's not really a

291
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,560
lot you can do about a lot of these

292
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,899
things actually turns out I should have

293
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:13,980
probably thought about that before doing

294
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,860
a tour today hey anyway

295
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,000
what you can do

296
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,980
which is one so one thing you can use

297
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,100
the flipper for is uh stealing credit uh

298
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,440
you getting credit card information you

299
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,580
can either use it for your own credit

300
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,640
card information or if you're an Affairs

301
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,580
you could steal other people's

302
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,100
um I think I nearly saw it in action as

303
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,019
a joke last night somebody uh kind of

304
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:39,120
had a flip a zero via one of the uh

305
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,500
Wi-Fi scanners

306
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,779
and um you know it was good fun but yeah

307
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:43,680
and they're not gonna they're not

308
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,300
capturing it but you know that's a very

309
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,600
good capture point you know so

310
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,339
as a sensible thing

311
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:52,800
you can get riffid blocking wallets

312
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,779
some work some actually don't they're

313
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,640
just called River blocking

314
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,260
you don't know until you really try them

315
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,279
you know

316
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,019
um if you can I would get one you know

317
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:03,720
it's just it's sensible security what's

318
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,820
more important paying 20 quid for a

319
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,760
wallet or paying five grand in lost

320
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,380
credit card stuff every time someone's

321
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,880
done it for like 100 pounds I think 100

322
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,060
pounds is a wireless unknown transaction

323
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,500
now it's probably going to increase to

324
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,480
500 at some point

325
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,540
I don't have that much money either way

326
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,940
um so that's one thing to check

327
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,200
um

328
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,300
so most apps now uh whether you're

329
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,399
banking they have you know they'll

330
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:30,540
they'll give you an app you know they'll

331
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,500
give you an update saying like

332
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,560
transactions for uh what's gone out of

333
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,839
your card within the next 10 minutes

334
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:38,700
um I get them all the time so something

335
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,279
where someone might be kind of sitting

336
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,500
zapping at your interaction with a with

337
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,600
a card player well

338
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,060
you can see oh okay did it go through or

339
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,339
oh I'm hanging me I've got two on that

340
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:52,620
why is that happen you know

341
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,140
would the banks do anything I don't know

342
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,160
actually that's a good point actually

343
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,740
what would any uh Financial experts in

344
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,779
today

345
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:02,339
no I should have probably researched

346
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:04,140
that a bit but would they would they

347
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,519
would they would that be fraud or would

348
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,899
that be theft because normally the fraud

349
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:08,519
works that it's a fraudulent company

350
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,899
that's why I forget but this is an

351
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:11,640
individual that's kind of doing it so

352
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,899
it's not necessarily a trial right

353
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,060
anyway

354
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,860
that's something but yeah I mean

355
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:17,880
essentially

356
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,040
for them to not just swipe it they'd

357
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,420
have to probably swipe it run it through

358
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,760
a machine then take the transaction that

359
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,860
way so you could I guess why check it to

360
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,279
an actual machine but it's it's a bit of

361
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,779
thought but it's possible and I think

362
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:33,240
like being alerted for that that would

363
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,920
definitely help

364
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,459
um yeah check the king let's go

365
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:40,260
really do check it uh if you've got a

366
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,640
new car I wouldn't worry too much about

367
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,139
it you probably

368
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:44,579
it's already got it in there but

369
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:47,639
certainly old ones around 2000 2010

370
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:50,160
anyone's got a car around 2 000. anyone

371
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,360
got a car

372
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,300
look yay

373
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,740
go in the environment um

374
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,839
[Laughter]

375
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,279
pick your car

376
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,540
it's good brilliant

377
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,279
so that's essentially it

378
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,279
um

379
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,720
I've realized I've got another 15

380
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,459
minutes I always do this why do I always

381
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:14,279
end talks so quickly

382
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:16,019
but that's essentially it

383
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:18,240
um are there any questions

384
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,839
I will

385
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,300
I've got to learn speak quick a lot

386
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,700
slower I think

387
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,760
thank you hello yeah really interesting

388
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,560
talk thank you I'm always interested in

389
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,260
flipper and how how it's kind of to me

390
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,779
do you would you agree that flip the

391
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:39,060
release of flipper is almost similar to

392
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,459
how when HD Moore released Metasploit

393
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:43,800
with the like 2000 over 2 000

394
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,019
vulnerabilities just for anyone to to

395
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:47,700
use and then flippers a little bit like

396
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,639
like that what do you agree that is a

397
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,160
great point because yes I think it is

398
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,980
very similar to feedback um look

399
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,240
um it's a really good point because it

400
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,519
makes life easier it makes

401
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:06,959
you know it's I guess it's moving from

402
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,880
I call them sophisticated attacks but an

403
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,320
attack where you have to think a little

404
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,940
bit in stages of what you're going to do

405
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,100
it makes it into an all-in-one let's

406
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,160
fire and forget or spray everywhere and

407
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,079
see what we can do and it does make it a

408
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:20,820
lot quicker the fact that the fact that

409
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,820
my family that are really not into cyber

410
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,440
security Tech or anything and just see

411
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,880
it as a game

412
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,700
that is kind of for me like like

413
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,920
Metasploit if I showed the Metasploit

414
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,300
there I think it was some kind of cool

415
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,300
game if I put it wrapped it in a GUI and

416
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,639
actually called it random hacker game

417
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,860
and put it on Steam

418
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,040
it you know they would play here

419
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,540
that's that's what I find like quite

420
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,339
good you know the only thing is really

421
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:49,740
stopping a lot of this is is the human

422
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,260
interface that they actually have you

423
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,420
know when when you get to like one

424
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,639
button push click kind of stuff it's you

425
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,320
know it's well it's like deployments

426
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,600
right everyone use Jenkins it's the same

427
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,920
thing you know you don't need to know

428
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,260
the nuts and bolts of a server to deploy

429
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,820
anything on Jenkins you just need to

430
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,160
push a button normally to Let's deploy

431
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,540
to a whole Grid or

432
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,000
subset or servers that's how it works

433
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,899
these days yeah definitely

434
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,860
anyone else have a question

435
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:22,100
there we go

436
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,699
thanks for the introduction to The

437
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:29,060
Flipper uh well I have one myself

438
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:32,459
actually and I might point out that

439
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:36,060
there are the uh this thing is updated

440
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,339
every week the software and new features

441
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:40,199
are installed there there are also some

442
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:42,240
things on on GitHub which you can

443
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,540
download like plugins and also stored

444
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,519
frequencies for example if you are

445
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,220
running around seeing a Tesla there you

446
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,860
can even download the frequency because

447
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,180
they are all running on the same

448
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,060
frequency opening their charging ports

449
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,940
yeah right there are movies I think on

450
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,519
on on YouTube there as well and I have

451
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:05,519
had fun with uh this one actually when I

452
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,380
was at Glasgow giving a course

453
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,600
we went to a pub there with some of the

454
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,779
participants and they actually said then

455
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:16,079
uh well how can we be served here

456
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,480
because no no waiters were around but

457
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,480
there were a lot of a lot of these big

458
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,699
big things going like big TVs there and

459
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:25,800
so yeah wait a moment there's a

460
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,120
universal TV remote and well actually we

461
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,320
can try that is it on infrared

462
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,440
okay yeah okay so but actually we turned

463
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,660
off the TV and then they came and said

464
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:43,680
oh TV is off so yeah we you can have in

465
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,540
some settings there quite fun with it

466
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,339
and it's also a very cool tool and you

467
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,720
can also as you said it's very flexible

468
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,839
so yeah agree yeah no I mean one one

469
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,940
thing I tried today in preparation

470
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,360
because it's in like I think uh Lena dog

471
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,699
Phoenix on Twitter she'd open a McLaren

472
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:01,199
with it and I was like that's pretty

473
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,480
cool and scary if you have a McLaren I

474
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,240
guess but you know hey get it insured um

475
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,579
one thing I tried was with a VW

476
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:11,339
and no I couldn't but the interesting

477
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:13,319
that you said that the fuel cap is the

478
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,400
same frequency because what I found on

479
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,319
the VW is it's a slight it's like a

480
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,119
modulation around the frequency it's

481
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,859
never the exact one I thought it was

482
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:21,660
quite a cool uh quite a cool little

483
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,579
feature but um

484
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,439
and I guess that that's it it's like

485
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,660
someone thought about that before while

486
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,280
they built the car I mean it was only

487
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,260
last year's model so maybe that was the

488
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,760
thing

489
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,980
I mean I have a question

490
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,860
um specifically all right we have uh we

491
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,260
have a question coming in uh from Mike

492
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:44,400
who asks is this just another example of

493
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,140
tech flooding the market with no

494
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,940
responsibility being taken by the

495
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,100
manufacturers for the risk that it

496
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,600
introduces

497
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,600
waiting words for Mike this morning

498
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,220
I mean like he's definitely hearing

499
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,679
Spirit isn't he right

500
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:01,380
um I mean this is the thing it's

501
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,299
with any technology

502
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:05,100
where is the res where is the

503
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,480
responsibility ice would say the

504
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,799
responsibilities of the people that

505
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:09,480
actually make the things that can be

506
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,419
attacked you know and I think there is a

507
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:15,419
responsibility with probably us as

508
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:17,700
people if we do say this is a really

509
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,020
cool thing

510
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,580
yeah obviously have security kind of

511
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,900
professional was to say this is a really

512
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,760
cool thing you can do but here's all the

513
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,260
things why you shouldn't do it

514
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,299
you know I think I'm very much of

515
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:29,700
opinion you know working in Tech you

516
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,200
know for like 10 years like just because

517
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,419
you should can do something doesn't mean

518
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:36,179
you should right and I think like

519
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:38,760
like you know I kind of work like kind

520
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,100
of self I hate that word self-taught but

521
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,380
I think that is uni basically before I

522
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,120
started working Tech and you follow

523
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,460
certain software guidelines you want to

524
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,520
take or no and um you find basically you

525
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,620
follow certain techniques Without Really

526
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,059
knowing why you're doing them right

527
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:56,160
because that's the way it's done

528
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,720
that's it you don't really question

529
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,760
further and what you kind of learn from

530
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,640
you know when doing like kind of what I

531
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,679
learned from my formal education was why

532
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:06,240
you actually choose that route to do it

533
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,500
and I think that's the same with cyber

534
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,940
security you know there's a lot of

535
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,520
people that do things that don't really

536
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,559
know the consequences of why that sort

537
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:15,179
of approach to be taken

538
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:16,980
um you know a lot of people for example

539
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,419
when they're early in the industry it's

540
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:20,640
quite well known they love the actual

541
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,900
doing but they don't really love the

542
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,600
report writing which is often a lot of

543
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,100
yeah you have to justify your actions

544
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,360
right

545
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,260
um so yeah so yeah do I think it's

546
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,740
flipper Zero's fault no I do think it's

547
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,059
I mean it's a bit of a worry that it did

548
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:37,380
actually get kind of shut down with the

549
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,539
Customs bit in the US I don't really

550
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:41,880
know the real reason I all I remember is

551
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,400
seeing a lot of interaction with Teslas

552
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,900
and McLarens and maybe that was a reason

553
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,200
why that import kind of might have gone

554
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,120
that way but again that's me kind of

555
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,860
saying a hypothetical thing it's not

556
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,120
really I don't really know the real

557
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,880
reason does anyone who know

558
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,980
um and that's it so I think there is

559
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,299
some responsibility I think it's like

560
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,280
with cryptography as well you get

561
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,600
certain cryptographic assets that you

562
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,220
can't

563
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,240
um actually

564
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,500
um

565
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,299
you know the the you know within a

566
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:10,919
country they might treat it like a as if

567
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:12,419
it's a weapon

568
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,520
um and so yeah it's it's I don't think

569
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,919
the responsibility is really there it's

570
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:19,260
um it's down to everyone really

571
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,320
right uh so Mike has a question uh

572
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,600
another one should deeper regulation be

573
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,899
applied

574
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,940
no I don't like it I really don't I

575
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:33,380
don't like I think

576
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,020
um yeah I I really don't like it

577
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,240
um I think you should allow people to

578
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,559
make their own choices and you should

579
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,660
actually educate people a lot better on

580
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,760
cyber security and

581
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,100
um have a different time okay yeah

582
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,120
um you should educate people a lot

583
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,380
better on cyber security you should

584
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,419
actually you know allow them to make

585
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:52,980
decisions about their life you shouldn't

586
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,600
really go you must do this or you must

587
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,400
ban this

588
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,980
um you know yeah be harder you know I

589
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,080
think I think there's like a lot of laws

590
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,240
in this country that are about

591
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,799
don't do this because you'll cause harm

592
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,840
to yourself well actually that should be

593
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,700
fine full time to yourself don't cause

594
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,500
harm to other people that's the

595
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,760
important thing that's actually what you

596
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,500
should be harder on is actually when

597
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,020
you're actually you know interfere with

598
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,220
yourself as much as you want you know

599
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,260
don't interfere with other people and I

600
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,880
think that's that's generally how I feel

601
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,240
about that

602
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,160
so a small final question and this is

603
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,919
the one I was attempting to ask earlier

604
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:31,919
um so well let's have a question more of

605
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,500
a comment like uh Jordan earlier but

606
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,600
um you know how some uh sometimes the

607
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,919
flipper we don't even talk about this

608
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,539
anymore but the flipper is sold with

609
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:41,400
blocked frequencies that everyone

610
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,059
instantly unlocks so you know because of

611
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:47,940
you know for example the FTC uh off-com

612
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:51,240
in the US Etc yeah so

613
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,380
um yeah

614
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,080
it's it's pretty funny that you know

615
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,419
they have to put limitations in for it

616
00:21:57,419 --> 00:21:58,380
to work

617
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,200
but everyone just unpatches it in five

618
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,740
seconds nobody nobody does that right no

619
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,340
nobody does that because that would be

620
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,740
a crime yeah there you go so nobody does

621
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,600
that so I I completely refute your

622
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,080
question okay uh no I mean in in all

623
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,240
seriousness I think that if you've got

624
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,460
to follow what the law says however much

625
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,900
you might agree or disagree with

626
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,740
anything

627
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,500
um it's up to the person to do that but

628
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,520
they should probably be aware that

629
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,600
they're doing that

630
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,640
of course same thing with Marauder you

631
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,740
know Marauder when you have the Wi-Fi

632
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,780
you know the Wi-Fi extension is sold as

633
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,820
a developer debugging tool right what

634
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:38,100
they don't really kind of explain is the

635
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,080
consequences of that and then using a

636
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,700
script like Marauder which you know

637
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,960
everyone said you can get all these

638
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,320
scripts online they're all great

639
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,720
um but a lot of them are illegal they

640
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,980
tell you that and get her but it's like

641
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,960
you know just with any kind of software

642
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,159
you get from GitHub normally it's like

643
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:54,600
hey Gee Whiz use this thing it's really

644
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,799
cool and doesn't actually tell you what

645
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:58,200
happens with the pitfalls of it

646
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,700
um so yeah I think that's that's

647
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,440
basically it you should have you know

648
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,120
you can't go around selling illegal

649
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,260
stuff that's

650
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:07,220
life unfortunately

651
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,720
right well I think this uh if anyone

652
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,580
else has a question we can close it off

653
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:21,360
cool oh one oh two oh okay well we have

654
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,320
time so let's do this

655
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,799
thank you

656
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:28,260
um do you think the availability of

657
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,120
something like The Flipper

658
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:34,380
has a positive effect on accelerating

659
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,960
the development of security

660
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,580
yes it does I I honestly believe that if

661
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:44,400
you have tools that can break things in

662
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,559
ways that people building them have no

663
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,419
idea about then that can only be a good

664
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:51,059
thing because it's actually that I mean

665
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:52,559
that's essentially what the flipper zero

666
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,000
is it's not a toy it's not a cute

667
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,460
Tamagotchi thing it's actually a hacking

668
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,320
tool and it's a tool to make things

669
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,100
better

670
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,440
if used correctly and that's the

671
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,539
important thing you know so when you

672
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:05,159
have like kind of maybe government

673
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:07,080
saying oh we're gonna all outbound this

674
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,640
or whatever that's what that's where

675
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,500
it's wrong you know it's it's a

676
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,480
legitimate tool from a professional to

677
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,679
use in a professional environment

678
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,780
they've got permission for

679
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,179
and you know and it actually makes you

680
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:20,159
know the reason why we have security and

681
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,900
in software isn't because it was thought

682
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,220
of right

683
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:26,159
that's yeah it's the trail right you

684
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,440
build something someone breaks it builds

685
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,539
something improve it so this can only

686
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:32,220
improve things but you've got to let

687
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,500
people know about the improvements and

688
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,659
hopefully I think like a lot of maybe

689
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:38,400
that'll be when you know people are

690
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,320
building the next generation of locks in

691
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,460
cars

692
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,020
they'll use this tool and they'll try

693
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,520
and hack it themselves and they'll make

694
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,418
sure it's built better

695
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,159
and we had one final question

696
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,740
actually no question just wanted to say

697
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,659
that you're absolutely right this is a

698
00:24:57,659 --> 00:25:00,120
valuable tool if you are in a setting

699
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,039
where you have permission to use this

700
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:04,860
for example for I use this in with pen

701
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:08,220
tests actually because they some

702
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,760
companies do not know that they have all

703
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,340
the tags they are running around but you

704
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,740
can actually enter a building like the

705
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,260
iso

706
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:22,020
1443 which is actually nothing more than

707
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,360
a uid

708
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,120
um and this thing can also copy these

709
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,299
let's get kind of emulate these but it

710
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:31,559
can also

711
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:34,500
um copy these to to uh to other cards

712
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,559
and other tokens so you can even make a

713
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:39,960
duplicate of these cards and with it

714
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,419
it's the same with My Fair Classic so

715
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:44,700
they they all have these Technologies

716
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,440
and think that we have access control

717
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,679
but actually if I get to to someone who

718
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,500
has access to this you leave your badge

719
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,779
lying on valuable you can simply it's a

720
00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:56,700
matter of seconds sometimes sometimes it

721
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,400
takes longer but actually this and this

722
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,159
is a vulnerability so yeah so this is

723
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,020
this is a I think this is an example

724
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,880
where this two comes in very handy

725
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,500
because you don't have or need to have

726
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,720
all the other tools now it's all in one

727
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,419
yeah and that's yeah I think that works

728
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:14,039
really well and is also quite a scary

729
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,860
Prospect if it's used for bad you know

730
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,419
it's an only one tool that does

731
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:21,860
everything that's good

732
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,360
right uh I think we'll close it up for

733
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,400
right now we have our next speaker being

734
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,659
remote so

735
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:30,299
uh we all just set that up and uh there

736
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:33,300
we go thanks everyone

737
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,819
[Applause]
