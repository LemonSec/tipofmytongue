00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,680
hi everyone

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,600
um it's a great pleasure to be here over

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,259
a year after a year and it's been a long

4
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:09,240
interesting year I'm pretty sure for all

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,420
of us and today I want to share share

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,000
what's happened on our site in terms of

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,020
doing uh crowdsource security and doing

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,699
security for web3

9
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:25,080
so briefly briefly about

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,140
yeah briefly about me I'm a co-founder

11
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,359
of hacken hiking as a cyber security

12
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,600
auditor for over three projects also I'm

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,980
responsible for business development

14
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,860
within hacken and I'm a CEO of our back

15
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,680
Bounty platform called hack improve a

16
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,379
brief about my backgrounds I spent six

17
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:45,300
years in University teaching cyber

18
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,860
security like learning cyber security

19
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,379
and actually teaching a lot of students

20
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,480
and organizing different communities

21
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,300
like deaf conceptors of Us chapters in

22
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,699
Ukraine uh I've been taking different

23
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:59,520
certifications participating in a lot of

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,039
different ctfs organizing a lot of

25
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:05,040
different ctfs and hackathons and today

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,340
I want to share more about

27
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,979
what we're building now and

28
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:15,299
what use cases we have so uh hiking is a

29
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,580
cyber security company we've been doing

30
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,340
security for crypto for the last five

31
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,640
years as for now we're around 100 team

32
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,700
members uh for the last five years we've

33
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,420
done a lot of different stuff and

34
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:33,240
offensive cyber security like a

35
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,340
different penetration testing all these

36
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,140
source code review another for more than

37
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,020
one thousand clients

38
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,520
um if you're in crypto you might know

39
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,979
the names like Avalanche like okay

40
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,680
Ceviche polygon into lots of others so

41
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,020
this is a major players of web3

42
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,360
ecosystem which is building right now

43
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,360
and today I'm in there I'm conference in

44
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,020
Bogota where like around 7000 people

45
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,479
gather it's like crypto developers

46
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,540
ethereum developers And discussing a lot

47
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,159
of interesting stuff especially about

48
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,680
cyber security

49
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,139
um yeah and as a company we're

50
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:12,120
contributing actively to make this

51
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,720
industry more secure because it's quite

52
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,760
um relatively new if you're comparing to

53
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,640
web2 because in the two we have all the

54
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,160
standard certifications methodologies

55
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,920
principles Frameworks whatsoever and

56
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,660
it's not something that really works in

57
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,480
web3 you need to adopt this and that's

58
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,040
something that we're doing for example

59
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,080
with Enterprise stream Alliance building

60
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,720
the standards how all these audits

61
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,879
should should look like what should be

62
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,540
in this engagements and how actually

63
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,819
ensure that this industry is secure but

64
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:47,099
in fact it's not it's uh so today is

65
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:49,260
Wednesday I didn't have these slides in

66
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,239
my presentation I didn't have time to

67
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:54,599
include this but Monday started from the

68
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:58,319
binance hack it was let me see it was

69
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,700
for

70
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,580
um around 500 million dollars than

71
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,680
yesterday it was five hacks for crypto

72
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,080
projects so one is sampled out for two

73
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,540
million then Quantum uh blockchain for

74
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,900
one million then Solana applied from uh

75
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,900
mango it's 100 million and another

76
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,140
project is like 200k so it's just

77
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,599
Wednesday today and it's going crazy it

78
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,060
was a crypto hacks I don't know why but

79
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,060
yeah looking forward to this day what it

80
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,019
brings us

81
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:30,840
but the numbers are huge and the

82
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,560
industry where we work is relatively

83
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,480
um new and immature in terms of security

84
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,120
especially and if we know that the

85
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,739
shortage of a really qualified

86
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:43,620
specialist in Webster and crypt in web 2

87
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,680
for security is huge just imagine what's

88
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,860
going in that tree and on the market so

89
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,260
we're at one of uh top Auditors on the

90
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,780
market and the general adicitation that

91
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,299
there is like Southern projects and

92
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:01,019
around 20 really skilled Auditors just

93
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:05,299
imagine how much work here for everyone

94
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,400
um yeah so as as for what we do how

95
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,500
we're helping the industry reduce my

96
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,140
contract audits for different chains uh

97
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,459
if you're familiar with this like

98
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:17,940
ethereum based chains like rust uh rust

99
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,199
based

100
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,959
chains and also we do this on the level

101
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,820
of Publications or this on the level of

102
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,220
applications it's my contracts then on

103
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,720
the level on the protocol itself

104
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,840
checking the consensus the cryptography

105
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,720
not configuration infrastructure and all

106
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,240
other stuff also we do a traditional

107
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,280
penetration testing because at the end

108
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,320
of the day it's all like weapon mobile

109
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,259
applications and that's something that

110
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:46,320
we do quite good for crypto exchanges

111
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,240
you know really been working I was

112
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,940
around 50 of them 50 of major crypto

113
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,639
exchanges also we have a back Bounty

114
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:56,220
platform which I am going to talk more

115
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:56,880
um

116
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,340
and then having the diabloid it's

117
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,380
decentralized application audits that's

118
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,180
more like source code review if we're

119
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,720
talking in the terms of web 2. so as for

120
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,900
our team based like last year when I had

121
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,639
to the talk at this conference we were

122
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:14,580
around 40 I guess heading office in Kiev

123
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,880
and now we're around 100 having a lot of

124
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,120
team members all over the world and now

125
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,539
our office moved to Lisbon to Portugal

126
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:27,840
because of uh or because of the board

127
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,199
yeah and it's getting more decentralized

128
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,000
and more International and we're really

129
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,560
happy about that because definitely

130
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,539
contributing the different minds and

131
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:38,520
different skills and cultural

132
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,039
backgrounds really helps to diversify

133
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,520
approaches to security and help us to

134
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,280
ensure that our customers recover it

135
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,979
from every possible angle

136
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:52,320
so as for bug bounties

137
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,539
um last time I was talking about how to

138
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:56,340
succeed in background is what you need

139
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,680
to do for switching to be like Buck

140
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,080
Hunter and today I want to talk more

141
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,020
about what is back Bounty for web3 how

142
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,919
is it going what updates we have and

143
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,380
um yeah I'll tell you more about web3

144
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,479
and how inspiring it is and how much

145
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,180
work here and the help you a really

146
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,919
scary skilled specialist we have and

147
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,680
that we really need your help to protect

148
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,340
this industry as well so in brief the

149
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,319
um what volunteers the like crowdsourced

150
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:28,860
way for identifying bugs in any kind of

151
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,180
projects either it's like a web

152
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,940
application mobile applications

153
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,460
infrastructures even hardware

154
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:38,340
and yeah so usually the back bouncer

155
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,960
reward is a way cheaper than the real

156
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,500
exploit and paying for that and it's

157
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,720
kind of you know proactive security to

158
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,419
minimize risks ahead of time and it's

159
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:51,539
good when you have the like thousands of

160
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:53,819
ice looking at your code trains to find

161
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:56,220
vulnerability and do this from every

162
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,100
possible angle utilizing different tools

163
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,860
methodologies and uh yeah playing

164
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,319
different mindsets because all of us are

165
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,419
different and we think different I and I

166
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:08,400
guess it's really good to unite this

167
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,979
power to help to identify mobile

168
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:13,380
vulnerabilities and

169
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,020
yeah find a way how it works if we're

170
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,660
talking about who helps to make this

171
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,479
happen so we have a couple of bug Bounty

172
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:23,880
providers and I really like what's going

173
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,520
in that's free and that's there is like

174
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,160
traditional web bouncy platforms like

175
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,800
hacker one and background integrity and

176
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,580
a lot of others and a lot of um a lot of

177
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,220
different new approaches to bug bounty

178
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:42,360
in webstery and so guys are trying to

179
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,720
decentralize all the approaches how to

180
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,360
unite the power of community and how to

181
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,940
make sure that this is just covered from

182
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,759
every possible angle because as we know

183
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,979
in like back balances it's all about

184
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:58,080
engagement and dedication of the

185
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,880
engineering time that you do and yeah we

186
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,160
have another players in the web stream

187
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,740
market like you mean if I had Finance

188
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,500
coloring and Hiking proof so what we are

189
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,720
we're doing we're like focusing only on

190
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,060
that three projects I'm trying to help

191
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,819
them to solve these particular issues of

192
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:19,500
dealing with the smart contracts with

193
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,360
the blockchain protocols decentralized

194
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,160
applications groups or wallet script

195
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,440
exchanges and it's interesting that if

196
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,180
we have the

197
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,220
um like really huge problems in that too

198
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:33,000
I haven't followed uh what's the uh

199
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,659
what's the level of discussion uh now at

200
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,399
the beer con but they see the pretty

201
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,339
active Twitter feeds so the problems in

202
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:44,520
the tree is a great way more difficult

203
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,260
and

204
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,060
um not much specials that can help

205
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,700
that's why a lot of guys trying to unite

206
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,560
different Specialists from different

207
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,720
angles having this source code reviews

208
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,300
like penetration testing a lot of red

209
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,940
teaming activities try to identify these

210
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,360
problems

211
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,320
um yeah and if you're talking about

212
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,420
hiking proof we'll be building for the

213
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,920
last five years we have now around 12K

214
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,200
researchers on the platform a major part

215
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,820
of our business is working with the

216
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,640
centralized and decentralized exchanges

217
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,279
uh like uh Coco and hobby Optics and

218
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:23,279
lots of others so in fact it's an easy

219
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,300
way for uh for like penetration testing

220
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,640
Specialists security researchers just to

221
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,279
go from something they really know uh

222
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:35,700
like web applications and to move uh to

223
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,740
like webstery and understand it as my

224
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,260
contracts honestly there is the

225
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,140
situation with equipped exchanges is

226
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,580
becoming more

227
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,920
um more easier in terms of security

228
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,760
there is less

229
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,519
still a lot of other stuff going on the

230
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,220
smart contracts and protocols yeah so if

231
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,779
you're if you're just studying and

232
00:09:57,779 --> 00:09:59,399
wanted to see what's going on on the

233
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,740
steps tree just go check backgrounds for

234
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,500
crypto exchanges because it's still all

235
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,720
the web applications that you really

236
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,120
know how to deal with

237
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,260
yeah

238
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:10,920
um

239
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,620
so go in moving forward it's interesting

240
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,959
uh how what's the cost of hikes in

241
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:18,660
crypto that's insane and yeah so briefly

242
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,120
background is really a good way to

243
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,220
enhance your skills to try everything

244
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,440
out different applications different

245
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,600
methodologies and whatever you want and

246
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,720
that's good for like recognition by

247
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,640
entire Community especially in crypto

248
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,100
and everything is transparent and open

249
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,160
and everyone can see the hack and what I

250
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,200
like a lot about crypto then when hack

251
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,880
is happening everyone knows this about

252
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,040
like in seconds it's not like in going

253
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,680
back Banks or somewhere else where you

254
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,140
might know this in couple of months in

255
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,880
crypto you know this right away and

256
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,920
everyone knows this right away

257
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,200
yeah so if you want to try it out in

258
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,420
crypto just start with something easy

259
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,339
like crypto exchanges where you can

260
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:03,000
still research web applications and then

261
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,880
go deep into smart contracts blockchain

262
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,680
protocols how all this works what type

263
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,440
of the vulnerabilities there

264
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,100
um yeah and join this I'm sure sharing

265
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,800
some links so in in crypto we have also

266
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,180
this kind of

267
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:23,459
um uh the training grounds for for try

268
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:25,920
try this out how all this works the

269
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,320
different kind of ctfs so you can start

270
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,240
with easy stuff and also there is

271
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,100
already a lot of categorization of

272
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,440
different vulnerabilities and how this

273
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,680
works what the Explorers examples so if

274
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,060
you if you're really interested in this

275
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,420
it's easy to find all this information

276
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:42,959
um

277
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,720
yeah and then what I wanted to say that

278
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,579
it's uh really

279
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:49,920
huge rewards in crypto if you're

280
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,740
comparing to web 2 back bounties where

281
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,500
we have maximum like 100k for critical

282
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,500
vulnerability and crypto it's like 10

283
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,480
million for critical vulnerability

284
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,940
because it's but it's still interesting

285
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,600
that the amount of money at risk could

286
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,760
be the same but the reports are not the

287
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,980
same and in crypto you can easily

288
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,060
receive like 10 6 million for epic

289
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,579
bounties yeah and wrapping it up I won't

290
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:19,680
briefly share what's happening with us

291
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,480
on the personal level as far as we are

292
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,060
from Ukraine and the major parts of our

293
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:28,500
team in Ukraine and we decided to move

294
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,200
for the team 10 days before the War I

295
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,660
started it was difficult decision but we

296
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,880
decided to minimize risks and we were

297
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,700
playing just to go to Europe somewhere

298
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,700
for two weeks but where it's uh what

299
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,760
what month it is it's October and we're

300
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,800
still still in Europe

301
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,740
one briefly to share about what our

302
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,839
company does and what's going on the

303
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,260
cyberspace there so we understand that

304
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,260
we might be helpful with our skills

305
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,300
about helping like

306
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,339
um receiving more money for work and

307
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:05,339
donating and now we have really good

308
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:07,740
motivation to succeed in this and they

309
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,980
were like scaling now hiring now and

310
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,220
doing everything possible to help our

311
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,440
country friends and family

312
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,839
and people are talking about the Cyber

313
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,220
War I'm pretty sure you're following

314
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,220
what's going on that's crazy

315
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,980
um we were helping also with our skills

316
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,860
as far as we can uh it's interesting how

317
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,639
the community actually United to help in

318
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,680
in this cyber world

319
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,959
so we have kind of it Army let's say

320
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,860
it's called like this was around

321
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,720
200k

322
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,639
users and people who wants to help the

323
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,899
different tasks for uh for like QA

324
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:51,660
cyberspace I also I have a lot of

325
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,399
different hackathons actually I guess

326
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,500
it's going this week or next week it's

327
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,839
like National Defense hackathon for

328
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,600
Innovations in cyber defense

329
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,800
brainstorming how to protect the country

330
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,740
and what's going on generally what we

331
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,680
see there are a lot of DDOS attacks I

332
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,300
guess that's the top for for like and

333
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,579
breaking their websites of some small

334
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:17,579
cities and uh like from the

335
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:19,920
administration of small cities trying to

336
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,500
do something there it was the boss

337
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,820
phrase

338
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,959
um

339
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,760
yeah like everyone doing everything

340
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,639
possible uh it's interesting and

341
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:31,880
sophisticated factors of attack

342
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,620
and it's evolving a lot

343
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,279
also what's interesting that our country

344
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:39,959
becoming like more and more advanced in

345
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:42,959
crypto a lot of donations were done in

346
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,019
crypto with different mft auctions and

347
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:50,160
other stuff and also now for some years

348
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,079
we already have the application which is

349
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,120
like government application with IDs

350
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,220
with driving licenses with credit

351
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,980
certificates and everything and they're

352
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,440
like now we have so many users there

353
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,019
it's like 400 percent increase and

354
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:06,959
compared to the last year uh by using

355
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,160
this application so now everything

356
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,180
online it's another point of um cyber

357
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,579
cyber risks but still it's great that

358
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:17,760
it's easy to unite everyone and because

359
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,199
a lot of people just lost their

360
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,360
passports for example they can use this

361
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,920
application to prove that they are

362
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,699
ukrainians and do this online in quite a

363
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:29,779
few European countries

364
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,639
um yeah and we're like working hard and

365
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,040
legalizing crypto it's still under a lot

366
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,800

368
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,300
