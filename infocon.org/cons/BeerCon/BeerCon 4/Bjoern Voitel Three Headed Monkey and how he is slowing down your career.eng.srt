6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,800
please apply for it so yeah the talk is

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,720
named Three-Headed Monkey and how he's

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,240
slowing down your career actually this

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,400
talk was inspired by a TED talk I've

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,880
heard some time ago it was called Inside

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,760
the Mind of a master procrastinator by

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,000
Tim Urban did you uh who of whom of you

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,219
have already heard this this Ted Talk

14
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:36,239
yeah

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,260
it's it's quite funny I absolutely would

16
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,040
suggest that you look into it it's about

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,020
someone who's procrastinating and he has

18
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,079
pictured a monkey inside his mind who is

19
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,980
uh going to take the steering wheel from

20
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,640
him uh and he he's prop he has problems

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,039
taking that steering wheel from the

22
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,980
monkey so and also the um the

23
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,619
Three-Headed Monkey Do you know

24
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:08,580
from from what game it is

25
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,439
it's from The Secret of monkey Islands

26
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:15,299
so this is that's why I chose this one

27
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,840
so something about me uh I'm 44 years

28
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,920
old I've studied economics

29
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,140
and information

30
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,700
and information systems

31
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,680
I'm an infosecond privacy professional

32
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,159
with more than 20 years of experience as

33
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,780
Nikki already said I'm the owner of

34
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,340
three companies

35
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,759
I have a few certs as well I'm an

36
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,900
auditor I'm also doing pen testing and

37
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,280
I'm an instructor and from that on I'm

38
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,340
sharing some of my experiences I have

39
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,159
had as an instructor with my students

40
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,479
and that's also the main theme for my

41
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,180
presentation here and I'm also having a

42
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,159
strong interest in studying human

43
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,880
behavior and especially helping people

44
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,239
to be more successful in what they do

45
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:10,860
you may have come

46
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,099
to something to some place called Sunday

47
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:16,920
Isle it's a very nice place because

48
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,599
someday I'll

49
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:23,340
be I'll do that when I have more time

50
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,239
someday I'll

51
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:29,099
Sunday I'll

52
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:32,520
get that search or someday I'll do that

53
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,599
exam

54
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,860
well

55
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,260
the background is now

56
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,500
that we all have a fear sometimes of

57
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,540
failing

58
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,459
one example

59
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:48,060
I once had this man coming to me he had

60
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,360
taken a hacking curl course but he

61
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,060
didn't book The certification exam

62
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,000
right after it and he won he said he

63
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,819
wanted to prepare a bit more and yeah he

64
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:03,540
had to choose some kind of test center I

65
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,420
had to choose a location for that well

66
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,300
and then something else came

67
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,480
it uh into the timeline

68
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,540
and by now actually

69
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,940
um we felt not well prepared or then he

70
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,340
was on holiday and to my knowledge his

71
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,720
exam voucher has now expired right

72
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,360
and on another occasion there was this

73
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,300
woman who was on one of my hacking

74
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,800
courses

75
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,260
and she was often mocked by her

76
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,519
colleagues

77
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,459
saying okay you want to try to get in

78
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:40,260
the cyber security field you are not

79
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,580
good enough and then she yeah and then

80
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,580
she was not so confident with herself

81
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,700
and one evening after the course she

82
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,700
talked to me about her situation

83
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,959
and she asked me what do you think am I

84
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:00,780
ready for the exam and I said yes

85
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,299
definitely take that take that on Friday

86
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:06,959
and what shall I say she passed

87
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,159
so

88
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,099
actually and she felt very relieved and

89
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:14,519
apart from that uh regarding her nasty

90
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:16,738
colleagues because the biggest revenge

91
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:19,560
is massive success

92
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,500
so here we have the Three-Headed Monkey

93
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,160
which is actually an extension to the

94
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,300
original Ted Talk yeah from Tim Urban

95
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,139
um well he he had this monkey inside his

96
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:36,720
mind he record the instant gratification

97
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,699
monkey

98
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:41,639
uh meaning he was would be the monkey

99
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,020
would be

100
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,199
um making him to do what was actually

101
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,979
fun to do

102
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,240
um but in his talk he didn't get too

103
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,400
deep into the underlying reasons for

104
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,440
procrastination

105
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,960
about and I try to pick up on that one

106
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,960
thought and uh well and there was the

107
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,340
Three-Headed Monkey

108
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,639
and we have the first monkey is the

109
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,820
fearful actually the font is a bit off

110
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,400
but actually we'll get the point then we

111
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,080
have the perfectionist

112
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,900
and we have the procrastinate and we all

113
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,080
come back to these uh during the

114
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,280
presentation

115
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,880
now let's take make a quick thought

116
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,160
experiment right

117
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,280
let's imagine that this stage

118
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,120
is some kind of board which is lying on

119
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,139
the ground

120
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:36,419
okay and

121
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,139
our goal is to cross this board

122
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:43,380
now this is quite wide this is quite

123
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,740
thick and well we can walk over the

124
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,440
board we can even run over I can jump or

125
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,960
dance over the board right

126
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,180
I think we all agree this is a very

127
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,060
simple task

128
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,580
now

129
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,759
let's assume that this board is not

130
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:04,139
lying on the ground

131
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:08,460
but it is lying between two skyscrapers

132
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,580
and these skyscrapers are so high that

133
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,280
there are clouds beneath it and you

134
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,620
can't even see

135
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,660
through the clouds you don't can't see

136
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,500
what's beneath it

137
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:24,000
um so

138
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,400
it's still the same board

139
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,819
would you walk over it

140
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:32,100
yeah probably not

141
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,020
why not it's the same board

142
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,419
and you can't see beneath it you can't

143
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:37,940
see what's beneath it

144
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:42,440
so you're paralyzed

145
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,100
um

146
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,560
why that because the perceived

147
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,400
consequences of falling off the board

148
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:54,440
are now feeling much more severe

149
00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:57,780
and this leads us to the first monkey

150
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,380
which is the fearful fear is a very

151
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,600
interesting emotion

152
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,080
you can only have this emotion you can

153
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,840
only have fear about something which has

154
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,840
not yet happened

155
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,660
if it has already happened you can be

156
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,300
sad about it angry about it

157
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,819
but you cannot fear it anymore because

158
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:23,940
it has already happened

159
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,919
and

160
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,419
um

161
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:30,960
yeah and to give you another example of

162
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,800
this

163
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,639
if um I am I have a I have a fear of

164
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:38,220
heights really yeah well not not this

165
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,840
one but let's assume this is the board

166
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,780
lying on this on the on the skyscrapers

167
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,400
so

168
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,400
um if I normally have so much fear I

169
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,620
would not walk till the edge

170
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,139
but now then comes on and say hey Dan

171
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:55,860
and I'm standing there so I'm not longer

172
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,560
afraid of standing on the edge

173
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,039
I'm now afraid of falling

174
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,300
and

175
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,979
after that

176
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:10,319
then comes again and say hey and then

177
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,319
I'm falling I'm done falling really down

178
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:16,319
and then I'm no longer afraid of falling

179
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,860
I'm not afraid of Landing right

180
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,120
so

181
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,780
um

182
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:25,560
yeah so and this actually what we want

183
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,979
now is to reach our goal here the goal

184
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:30,419
could be

185
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:32,700
passing an exam

186
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:37,080
or get a certificate it could even be

187
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,260
delivering a proposal for a project

188
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,700
or a proposal for a customer

189
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,160
or applying for a new job and when this

190
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,920
goes on and on and we are we are

191
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,260
paralyzed at that point right we're

192
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,560
coming back to the situation in a moment

193
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,660
so here we are back with all three

194
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,300
monkeys and they are now making a

195
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,279
self-talk in your head they're making

196
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:03,300
chatter

197
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:07,500
the first one says oh this scares me and

198
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,220
the second one is well I'm not so sure I

199
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,220
am good enough or whether this drop is

200
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,519
really for me or whether I am ready to

201
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,620
take that exam you see the picture and

202
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:23,459
you see the the the picture there and

203
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:25,320
then that's better watch another episode

204
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,339
of XYZ on Netflix yeah so this is fun

205
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:32,220
and easy to do so

206
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,519
uh he he then comes up with a solution

207
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,920
for this and he has a solution of

208
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,380
procrastinating

209
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,459
so

210
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:44,940
talking about procrastination so how why

211
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,640
do we procrastinate

212
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,399
actually we are caring about how other

213
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,660
people

214
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,480
um and how we feel about ourselves in

215
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,560
all kind of situations

216
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,700
um we want to prevent some kind of

217
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,399
feeling that we are not as good as

218
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,860
intelligent as attractive Etc as other

219
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,560
people

220
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,720
and if we have here I have some warning

221
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,060
signs which may mean that you are

222
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,700
procrastinating because sometimes we are

223
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,200
not really realizing it

224
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,779
um here we can see again that fear of

225
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:24,540
making mistake or fear of failure is a

226
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,500
central element here

227
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,360
um all these signs may also have a

228
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,560
deeper root cause in our history like

229
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,000
about how how about how our parents

230
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,959
um

231
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:43,500
were put up expectations on school

232
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,160
grades Etc so this is something we all

233
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,180
do but to the the intensity to how we do

234
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,839
that is maybe put into the root causes

235
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:57,740
of our history

236
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,279
because it's also rewarding

237
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:03,240
right

238
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,660
so and that's why we fall back to

239
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,540
um for example passively watching TV

240
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,180
why that because it's a mistake free

241
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,380
activity

242
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,079
I cannot do anything wrong sitting in

243
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,540
front of the TV but it's taken away our

244
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,920
precious time

245
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,420
until we may also become addicted to

246
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,399
procrastination and as a way of dealing

247
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,720
with anxiety about difficult tasks

248
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,640
so we've sometimes also become

249
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,140
overwhelmed by how a project is going on

250
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,839
we don't know how to start we don't know

251
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,560
what the next step is that's why also a

252
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,779
way of dealing with it is breaking a

253
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:49,079
complex project into simple more simple

254
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:51,720
tasks or more simple steps and then say

255
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,300
what is the next step we should what

256
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,399
should do to get out of those paralysis

257
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,300
and then

258
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,779
the perfectionist comes into play the

259
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:05,459
perfectionist monkey

260
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:08,459
because he's also saying something oh

261
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:09,959
okay

262
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:11,120
um

263
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,720
I you uh this is you are not good enough

264
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,440
right and we have three dimensions here

265
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,160
the first one is context yeah it is not

266
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,380
the right time it's not the right

267
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,899
location or we feel like we don't have

268
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:30,060
the right resources for it

269
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,579
then we have quality which made in our

270
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:35,279
perception it has to be of a very high

271
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,019
standard

272
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:39,959
um or even it has to be Flawless which

273
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:43,260
is ridiculous right nothing is really

274
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,440
Flawless if you think about that or we

275
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,700
have quantity

276
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,740
we have some kind of number threshold

277
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,220
which we have set up for us making such

278
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:58,200
and such uh number of Publications yeah

279
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,540
uh having certain certain number of

280
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,519
certificates

281
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:04,980
um we feel like we need to have a very

282
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,399
large gold size in the front so

283
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,139
um

284
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:11,820
perfectionism also has a very Toxic

285
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,200
effect

286
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,720
in the short term you're maybe not aware

287
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,560
of it

288
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,260
but it still makes makes you suffer

289
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,720
subconsciously

290
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,639
but it's something which is holding on

291
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:27,120
for a longer period of time then it may

292
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,519
lead to

293
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:31,200
extensive self-criticism it is an

294
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,079
underlying cause also in some cases for

295
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,519
depression right so on Monday

296
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:40,740
I don't know whether you have know it

297
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,380
last Monday what was it mental health

298
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,760
day

299
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,220
so I'm standing here I'm not a

300
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,279
psychotherapist right I

301
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:52,320
I'm interested in this subject if you

302
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,300
have these kinds of problems please see

303
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,660
someone who who can help you though

304
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,579
um and also imposter syndrome can be

305
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:01,500
linked to this right

306
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,660
this is also some some trait of

307
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,120
perfectionist and now

308
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,820
this is running into a cycle

309
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,399
because I'm a perfectionist I want to be

310
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:13,760
I want to

311
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,120
qualify all these elements here and I

312
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,980
have a fear of failure and this is an

313
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:23,820
underlying uh um an underlying pointing

314
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,639
so and that we procrastinate because we

315
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,220
want to look back don't want to look bad

316
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,600
then we

317
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,100
and then we're sitting on the couch

318
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,320
turning off the TV at some time three

319
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,240
hours into the day and then the research

320
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,060
criticize us and we still have some more

321
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:42,000
anxiety and it may turn into depression

322
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,060
there we we lose much of our

323
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,820
self-confidence again and then the whole

324
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,980
cycle starts again

325
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,060
and again and again at the perfectionist

326
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:58,620
component is making it even worse right

327
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:03,720
so okay so why then in the end do we

328
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,160
sometimes reach our goals after all

329
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,980
well there has to be an element which

330
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,260
puts you on the more severe consequences

331
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:17,160
than not finishing your project

332
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,440
and these are

333
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,940
deadlines

334
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,579
right imagine you are standing on the

335
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:26,399
board and someone has set a big fire to

336
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,560
one end

337
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,139
the board is still stable

338
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,480
but if you stay

339
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,600
at that end you will either burn or the

340
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,940
board will crash and you will fall down

341
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,740
anyway

342
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,980
right in that situation a deadline is

343
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,420
created

344
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,360
and it will cross the board

345
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,699
no matter what

346
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,740
okay

347
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:56,760
now how we can we use that informational

348
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,680
Advantage I mean if you have you have

349
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,480
crossed the board now

350
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,820
according to our project

351
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,220
what would be the result what quality of

352
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,920
the result would be of the project here

353
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,740
not a good one not a good one because we

354
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,300
have we have done that we have reached

355
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,720
the goal but it was not well done it's

356
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,760
even what

357
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,560
it's even worse then

358
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,139
so let's look at some strategies to get

359
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:25,199
us out of that paralyzed State now

360
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,600
so there are some here are some helpful

361
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,940
questions to ask yourself if you are in

362
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,500
that situation

363
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,320
the first is what's the worst thing that

364
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,079
could happen to me

365
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,120
um

366
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,839
really be honest about this one

367
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:45,600
um would it be some kind of reputation

368
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,519
loss

369
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,279
um would it be some kind of

370
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:51,420
um

371
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,440
well some someone being unhappy with you

372
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,980
or may it lead to the loss of life

373
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,100
no I don't think so because you are not

374
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,260
standing really on top of these of the

375
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,919
boardroom skyscrapers so

376
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,020
what's the worst thing that could happen

377
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:13,199
probably would be that the proposal for

378
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,359
the customer gets rejected

379
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,520
this happens all the time it does not

380
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,740
have to be something which is in

381
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,380
connection with your proposal could be

382
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,799
some completely other thing so so How

383
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:28,439
likely is this going to happen this is a

384
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:30,660
sub question to this one and can I

385
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,000
recover from it yes

386
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,880
can always recover from it

387
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:40,200
so coming back to the students asking me

388
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,500
am I ready for the exam say that am I

389
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,980
ready for the exam

390
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,780
they come up with a question say what if

391
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,480
I failed the exam actually

392
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,440
I say I have a solution for this as well

393
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,600
if for some reason you're fail at the

394
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,500
exam

395
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,179
you will take it again

396
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,760
as soon as possible

397
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,539
and these people have some I have very

398
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:09,179
high Pass rates about between 80 and 90

399
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:12,059
percent some fail this it's just like

400
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:15,900
that so and if they put use or if they

401
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,480
try the second attempt on the exam they

402
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,900
have passed and also we have to ask

403
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,820
another question so we don't think

404
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,799
negatively what's the best thing that

405
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:28,679
can happen to you and How likely is this

406
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:31,020
going to happen well maybe the customer

407
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,419
has

408
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:35,760
accepted your proposal or you have

409
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,440
passed the exam

410
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,500
so and how nice would that be just think

411
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,820
in the future

412
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,740
right

413
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,919
um and then think what's most likely to

414
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:49,140
happen

415
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,179
well this is something this depends on

416
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:53,520
on the situation that

417
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,640
and the next one I've got um actually

418
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,120
from a book which is uh called uh being

419
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,199
an imperfectionist

420
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,600
because imperfection is natural and

421
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,840
perfect perfectionism is artificial

422
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,000
we all have flaws

423
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,820
so circumstantial thinkers are more

424
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,760
focused on problems winners focus on the

425
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,100
process

426
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,900
this can even help us if we are

427
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,480
paralyzed focusing on the process get

428
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,860
the ball rolling

429
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,500
get the first step thinking about what

430
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,640
is the next logical step for me to take

431
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,480
so prioritize doing over not doing well

432
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,780
just get into action

433
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:43,200
break down your difficult tasks into

434
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,760
what

435
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,419
um

436
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:48,299
in into small steps push the needle

437
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:51,200
forward every day

438
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,120
we are doing we are making a habit out

439
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,580
of that one

440
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,780
if

441
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,539
how long do you think it takes to form a

442
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:01,919
habit

443
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,840
does anyone know

444
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,000
21 days

445
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,280
so if you perform something all day

446
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:12,660
every day for 21 days it becomes a habit

447
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,720
after 90 days

448
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,140
it becomes part of your lifestyle

449
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,660
you can't get it you can't get on

450
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,700
without it so push the needle forward

451
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,260
every day

452
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,020
so effort over perfection

453
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,100
well

454
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,740
just do something work on your project

455
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,900
be it a certification something like

456
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,020
that use the Pomodoro Technique

457
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:40,440
are you familiar with Pomodoro Technique

458
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,580
Sim very simple take a kitchen timer put

459
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,340
that onto 25 minutes and then work for

460
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:51,059
these 25 minutes straight

461
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:54,480
then after after that Rings you put down

462
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,520
everything and then

463
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,220
you take a five minute break and then

464
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,900
you take another pomodoro

465
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,520
that's a Pomodoro Technique actually

466
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,400
this could be working for some for some

467
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,919
it works for some take 25 minutes some

468
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,740
take 15 minutes 10 minutes whatever take

469
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,380
your time back and then yeah form good

470
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,799
habits

471
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,320
um so I'm so always tell yourself I'm

472
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,720
going to do my best and not care about

473
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,760
how it turns out

474
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,280
so if you have done your best you have

475
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,440
you have done it actually

476
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,080
and this is what's cap what's counting

477
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,080
or what should be counting

478
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,260
so again fears are leading to

479
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,539
procrastination a perfectionism is

480
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:41,580
making things worse

481
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,520
and the Three-Headed Monkey here is

482
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,600
trying to talk you into the easy fun way

483
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,640
uh and trying to get out of your

484
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,440
problems or get away from your problems

485
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,440
but also from again from

486
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,900
getting away from achieving your goals

487
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,179
whatever that might be

488
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:02,280
so you have to change your mindset as

489
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,440
well you're in a talk

490
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,919
do not think about when do I have to get

491
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,100
that job done think about when can I get

492
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,620
to work on that job again

493
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,080
I'm curious what is the next logical

494
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,360
step push the needle forward every day

495
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,059
there's one thing which is called the

496
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:24,120
one percent rule so we say we would like

497
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,200
to do

498
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,080
one percent every day to reach our goal

499
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,860
example if we have if I'm preparing for

500
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,780
a certification I may have to read a

501
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,440
book

502
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,380
this book has about 300 pages

503
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:41,039
and then I divide this one into these

504
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,840
one percent thing

505
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,600
yeah and then say okay if I'm doing one

506
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,740
percent every day this will be about uh

507
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,679
about three three yep three three pages

508
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:55,500
can you read three pages of the day

509
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:00,240
yeah yeah so this is very easy right and

510
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,179
if you if you can do more even better

511
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:05,880
sometimes you just have to get rolling

512
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,980
you just have to go to ball rolling get

513
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,480
you have to get into the flow and then

514
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,179
you continue on this is the magic behind

515
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:14,340
that it tends to continue

516
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,000
it's not in reality we are all flawed

517
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,740
otherwise success would be normal

518
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,480
so thanks for attending my talk do we

519
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,440
have any questions

520
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,960
do we have time for questions

521
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,679

522
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,360
