00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,680
let me just uh go to uh to my slides

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,640
here

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,980
um first of all I was wondering I'm not

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,140
sure if I can see all your your chat or

11
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,160
whatever

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,340
um but maybe for just for you if you

13
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,840
could just make an estimate of what you

14
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,759
think a glass of water like this would

15
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,460
approximately weigh so if you know what

16
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,140
what I'm getting at here because you've

17
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,899
already seen the title of the talk uh

18
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:41,460
please don't spoil it for everyone else

19
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,860
but if you've no idea what I'm talking

20
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,200
about please just in your head or maybe

21
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,579
in the chat

22
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:49,559
um make an estimate of what you think a

23
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:50,820
glass of water like this would

24
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,940
approximately weigh and what I'm getting

25
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:54,960
at is

26
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,579
um it's going to be explained later in

27
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:58,860
the talk but for now just keep that in

28
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,820
mind

29
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,120
and uh I'm interested to think to see if

30
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,739
you've knew if you know the answer or

31
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:05,820
not

32
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,760
a little bit about me I'm actually not

33
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,939
um like most people in in this field uh

34
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,260
not really schooled in interest

35
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,939
information security I'm actually a

36
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:17,939
criminologist I've studied criminology I

37
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:20,280
have a master's degree uh at the

38
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,140
Amsterdam University

39
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,619
or a uh over a decade ago so you know

40
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:29,520
certain generation and I'm a seesaw for

41
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,500
the Dutch Authority for consumers and

42
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,200
markets which is a regulatory Authority

43
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,960
in the Netherlands we regulate consumers

44
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,880
and markets so we make sure there's no

45
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,640
illegal cartels we make sure that

46
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,700
consumers rights have are properly

47
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,060
protected and I'm their CSO so I'm more

48
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,840
uh you know focused on the security of

49
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,960
our own organization and of course of uh

50
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,540
civil um you know all the information of

51
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,840
the the government that we have

52
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,420
I love infosec I've been working in this

53
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,880
industry for over 10 years in different

54
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,979
uh different jobs different

55
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:11,038
organizations and through these years

56
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,739
I've actually learned quite a few things

57
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:15,720
that I think might be valuable for

58
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,040
others and that you'd like to hear and

59
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,720
maybe there's some lessons there that

60
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,520
you can take from that so that's why

61
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,160
I've sent in the stock

62
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,560
and the first story I'm going to talk to

63
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,900
you about is quite a while ago it was

64
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,060
actually my first job I used to work for

65
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,459
the Dutch Police Department in Amsterdam

66
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:38,459
I I was working for the serious crime

67
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:41,040
unit and the financial crime unit as an

68
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,900
internet specialist

69
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,900
and as an internet specialist my job was

70
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,140
mainly Oceans open source intelligence

71
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:51,840
but also uh looking through log files

72
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,680
all sorts of information that might lead

73
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,200
to an arrest or you know solving crime

74
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,879
and

75
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:03,720
um one of the first uh cases I was on I

76
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,280
went to this team and I noticed that

77
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,620
they were Googling things a lot which is

78
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,720
you know kind of a good thing but if you

79
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,640
look at

80
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,580
um the the way they were Googling you

81
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,159
could quite tell from the referrer what

82
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,260
they their these referrals were quite

83
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,080
specific and I'll give you an example in

84
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,340
a minute

85
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,260
so I talked to the team and I told them

86
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,480
you know you might not want to search

87
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,959
Google for these specific terms because

88
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,239
the website owners that you end up

89
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:35,940
visiting can see these things and they

90
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,819
can also see the IP address and those IP

91
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,500
addresses from the computers that they

92
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,019
were using they would just end up when

93
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:45,420
you looked at a domain or the IP

94
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,099
registration they would just end up

95
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:49,440
looking at the new traffic Police

96
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,459
Department

97
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,620
which we were Amsterdam but hey Tomatoes

98
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,360
Tomatoes it's pretty clear it's a police

99
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,340
a computer so you might not want to do

100
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,019
that so I talked to him about it so you

101
00:03:58,019 --> 00:03:59,580
know if there's anything you want to

102
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,140
Google in this case I'm your internet

103
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,780
specialist feel free to come by and let

104
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,599
me know and I'll have a look

105
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:09,659
and they in this case they found they

106
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:11,819
did a house search and they found a key

107
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:14,879
that had a label on it and the label had

108
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,620
an address on it

109
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,940
um I don't know it's like a Village

110
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:21,779
Street six or something and uh of course

111
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,000
you know even though I talked to them I

112
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,040
told them not to Google it they actually

113
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,180
did

114
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,540
and and what they found was a website

115
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,660
from a real estate agent that was

116
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,580
um letting a storage unit next door so

117
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,520
they Googled Village Street six but that

118
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,280
wasn't available what was available was

119
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,800
the storage unit for uh the same street

120
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,020
but number four for example so the one

121
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,580
right next to it

122
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,940
and this website that was owned by this

123
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,100
real estate agent

124
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,740
of course could see the referrer

125
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,580
so when you are a webmaster you can you

126
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,139
look at the statistics of your website

127
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:05,520
and you want to find out how people

128
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,919
ended up on your website and you can see

129
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,520
that someone looked for Vint Street

130
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,060
number six and you know that you led

131
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,840
this to a very very well-known criminal

132
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,860
because of course that's not something

133
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,919
you tend to forget so you know this is a

134
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:25,139
criminal that hires this storage unit

135
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:27,840
and you know it's number six so you when

136
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,580
you look at the statistics of your

137
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,740
website and you see someone is Googling

138
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,660
specifically for the number six that's

139
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,940
interesting to you and you want you

140
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,680
might want to zoom into that and which

141
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,340
is obviously what he did and we were as

142
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,600
a police department we were thinking

143
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,160
there might be weapons in the storage

144
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,300
unit

145
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,520
uh and we had good indications of that

146
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,139
because people were talking about it on

147
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:52,500
the phone this is again way back it's 10

148
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,940
years ago

149
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,720
um these days I mean scribbles are not

150
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,539
always as intelligent but uh I'm not

151
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:02,400
sure they still talk over the phone as

152
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,080
clearly about weapons as they did in

153
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,100
those days

154
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,900
but they we had a good indication that

155
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,220
there were going to be weapons in the

156
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,320
storage unit that we found

157
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,080
um but however by the time we got there

158
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,180
the storage unit was completely empty

159
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,220
like they even almost sweeped the floor

160
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,919
for us it was there was nothing there

161
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,560
uh and we later found out that as I

162
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,780
predicted the webmaster had seen that we

163
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,539
had been looking at the Village Street

164
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:29,580
number six well that was not available

165
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,680
that hadn't been available for over a

166
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,759
year and he knew it was uh uh this led

167
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,500
to a criminal

168
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,960
so he actually he just warned him he

169
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,340
said the police department's gonna go

170
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,080
look for your storage unit I've seen it

171
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,400
on my website they're looking for you

172
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,520
don't uh get everything out as soon as

173
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,319
you can which he did

174
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:51,600
so what my point is telling you the

175
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,020
story is that behavior is quite a hard

176
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,520
thing to tackle and I think if you've

177
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,259
been working in for information security

178
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:00,900
for a while you've noticed this uh just

179
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,880
as much as I have that you can tell

180
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,639
people not to do something

181
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,020
think about clicking links and fishing

182
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,900
emails right if you know me excuse me

183
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,419
then you know how I feel about uh

184
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:14,160
phishing emails and fake fishing emails

185
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,080
but uh you know just telling people not

186
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,380
to do something in in security yeah good

187
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,840
luck with that I mean just assume

188
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,400
they're not going to listen to you

189
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,020
because most likely they won't

190
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:28,259
um

191
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:30,360
another another story I'd like to share

192
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,240
with you is uh is this one I I've been

193
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,919
working for a certain Organization for a

194
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:37,440
while and um we suffered a WhatsApp

195
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,199
phishing attack now to to make things

196
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,780
clear what's up in in the organization I

197
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,800
was working for was not used for uh work

198
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,720
reasons it was just there for social

199
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,479
reasons and I had warned uh that this

200
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:52,560
kind of thing could have happened before

201
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,080
again this is a behavior thing people

202
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,240
tend to not listen to you when you tell

203
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,599
them not to use it for work purposes uh

204
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:02,479
and they might just

205
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,880
do that and what happened was a couple

206
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,680
of people from my organization were

207
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,699
targeted

208
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:12,780
through um email telling them I am the

209
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,400
the board member of your organization

210
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,960
please give me your WhatsApp phone

211
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,259
number and once they did they got either

212
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:22,139
a link uh uh no they didn't get a link

213
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:24,660
they got a text message for the

214
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,639
verification code of the WhatsApp they

215
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,919
used so their their account could have

216
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:31,860
been taken over or they were told to go

217
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,979
get a iTunes gift card from a shop

218
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:37,080
so this was obviously not an advanced

219
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,839
persistent threat or apt this is just

220
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,479
some petty criminals but hey that's

221
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,399
sometimes that's all it takes and a few

222
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,519
of our our people had fallen for this so

223
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,339
I was called to the the leaders of the

224
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:52,680
organization and they told me you're our

225
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,740
CSO or your security person uh please

226
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,660
give us advice what should we do and I

227
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,640
said well if we don't use it for any

228
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,160
work purposes and it's just for social

229
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,380
reasons then why do we not just block

230
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,959
and ban WhatsApp all together from our

231
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,420
work phones we don't actually need it

232
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,240
it's it's an unnecessary risk to our

233
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,080
organization people can use the phone if

234
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,760
they want to talk to each other we can

235
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,580
find a more secure app if they want to

236
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,360
talk about work stuff but please please

237
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,339
please if you want to prevent this kind

238
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:28,200
of issue

239
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,940
um just block and banned WhatsApp from

240
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,980
our phones technically we can do this we

241
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,100
have work phones that are managed so

242
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,860
please do this and what they said was a

243
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,260
weekend I'm sorry Fleur we cannot do

244
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,839
this it's too useful we use it all the

245
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,140
time as as a board of this organization

246
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,480
we needed in order to tell each other

247
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,959
that we're waiting downstairs for lunch

248
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:55,320
or we need it for all sorts of uh well

249
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,839
reasons other than work

250
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,700
it's too useful I'm sorry we cannot

251
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,500
block it and I said well in that case

252
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,420
why not use signal or something else

253
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,820
yeah well other people don't use it so

254
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,800
it's not useful we need Whatsapp because

255
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,720
that's the most used app

256
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,820
and I struggled with this for a while

257
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,860
when I went home I was like well you

258
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,080
know this is gonna happen again and next

259
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,600
time it's going to be worse because this

260
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,399
weird these were a couple of petty

261
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,440
criminals you know wanting to get us to

262
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,300
get some iTunes gift cards but next time

263
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,100
it's going to be an apt and then we're

264
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,019
pretty much screwed

265
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:29,100
um

266
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,320
and and I I struggled with it for a

267
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,459
while and then I thought you know what

268
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:34,399
this is actually not my responsibility

269
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,339
it really isn't I'm just an advisor and

270
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:40,860
I've told them this is not very a smart

271
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,839
thing to do I've given them all the

272
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:44,660
information they needed to make a

273
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,339
intelligence decision and they've

274
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:50,700
decided to go the other way and that's

275
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,680
fine I mean I'm not the leader of this

276
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,660
organization I don't have that kind of

277
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,760
responsibility so why am I why is this

278
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,459
bothering me so much uh if things go

279
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:02,160
wrong all I have to say is I've told you

280
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,300
this

281
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,120
you didn't want to listen

282
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,820
you're responsible

283
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,279
um and and I think this is something I'm

284
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,899
gonna get back to this in a little bit

285
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:15,600
that we might want to you know get back

286
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,279
to a little more often in our field

287
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,579
because we care We Care a whole a whole

288
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,560
lot and that's a good thing but it also

289
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,620
messes us up sometimes

290
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,180
um and then there's there's another

291
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,399
story that that I wanted to share with

292
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:32,640
you and that's we were going to buy uh

293
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,040
when uh some uh I specifically I'm not

294
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,660
telling you which organization I worked

295
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,700
for when this happened because I don't

296
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,800
first of all it doesn't matter and

297
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,940
second of all I don't want to get into

298
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,160
trouble uh but I was working for one of

299
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,540
the organizations I've worked for in the

300
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,500
past

301
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,480
and we were going to get a security

302
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,459
incident and event management system has

303
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,800
seen so yeah there's different ways of

304
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,720
pronouncing that word security incident

305
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,420
and event management system right uh I'm

306
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,740
not going to say the old time like that

307
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,480
I just called to see

308
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,120
so we were gonna We you needed this

309
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,579
system for obvious reasons and we were

310
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:07,680
we went to a vendor that we had

311
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,839
purchased stuff from in the past and we

312
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,880
said well we need this please build it

313
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,459
for us and we have quite specific uh

314
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:16,880
requirements so it can be like uh

315
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,260
off-the-shelf solution it had to have

316
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,839
some some specific uh use cases in it

317
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,860
and pretty soon uh it became clear to me

318
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,899
that they could not provide but we need

319
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:30,300
it I asked for a Splunk instance because

320
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,980
I wanted to be able to look into the

321
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,620
scene myself I wanted

322
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,959
to have certain rights in the in Splunk

323
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,620
so I could make uh you know slight

324
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,380
changes in the use cases changed

325
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,540
thresholds if I felt it was necessary

326
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,339
that kind of thing they could not

327
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:49,620
provide me with that it seemed that they

328
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,779
were struggling with all sorts of to me

329
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:55,200
quite simple uh questions and a lot of

330
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,120
it was pushback we can't do this we

331
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,920
don't we don't want to do it or it's

332
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,899
going to cost you more money even though

333
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:02,880
we had a fixed price so it was we were

334
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,660
struggling and I pretty early on said I

335
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,579
think we should move on I think we

336
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:12,060
should change vendors or go looks for

337
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,380
for a solution somewhere else because

338
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,060
they can't provide

339
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,320
but the CIO and the IT manager that were

340
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,940
also involved with this project they

341
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,279
told me no we we've already invested so

342
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,440
much money into this

343
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,240
um you just gotta have to have some

344
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,160
faith and give them some a little bit

345
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,380
more time and I said I'm sorry I just

346
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,480
can't see it they don't have the

347
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,720
knowledge that is needed to do this

348
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,380
um

349
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,660
and then after I think it was three

350
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,940
years two or three years that's how long

351
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:45,180
it took to make this scene and they came

352
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:48,420
to us they gave us the final demo and I

353
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,579
will for the for the rest of my life

354
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,940
remember the first very first line that

355
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:57,240
this uh blesses our salesperson or demo

356
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,899
person said at this final demo and he

357
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:03,660
said and I quote whatever expectations

358
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,279
you had

359
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,480
cut them in half

360
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:13,380
so I was like okay well this is not good

361
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,120
because my expectations were already

362
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,339
quite low and it turned out I was right

363
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:19,380
and so was he

364
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,980
um because for we said initially we want

365
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,980
15 use cases I think that's quite you

366
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,560
know uh small for for a scene but we

367
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,000
said we might want to build on that but

368
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,860
we want at least 15 use cases and we

369
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,180
specified them

370
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,300
and we got five

371
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:41,699
and three worked and worked is a term I

372
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:44,339
will use Loosely here it was not

373
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:46,620
actually measuring what I had

374
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,680
anticipated or expected that use case to

375
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,720
measure and it was actually not very

376
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,620
useful either as a use case for a scene

377
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,139
so what I've learned from this is that

378
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:00,060
sometimes there's just nothing you can

379
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,880
do I mean we as a security people we

380
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,360
tend to break our our brains over things

381
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,120
we we keep on

382
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,519
trying to to get certain things

383
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,519
implemented and there's we can see

384
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:16,800
what's going wrong and you can scream it

385
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,480
from the top of your lungs and you can

386
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,940
tell everyone and do whatever you want

387
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,920
and sometimes there's just nothing you

388
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,459
can do and it will go wrong because

389
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:28,560
there are just people that will not

390
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,199
listen or just let it go wrong and how

391
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,579
do you deal with that it's something

392
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:36,380
that we're gonna talk about because

393
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:39,240
insecurity as you probably already know

394
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,880
a lot of the things we we run into is

395
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,920
that we cost a lot of money but the

396
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,380
results of what that money has been

397
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:50,399
spent on are clear are almost invisible

398
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,279
so the the funny thing is if you spend a

399
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,660
lot of money on security actually

400
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,139
nothing happens

401
00:15:57,139 --> 00:16:01,139
but that's the point we want nothing to

402
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:04,019
happen we want everything to go uh

403
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:06,540
smoothly and it's going smoothly because

404
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,699
you've spent money on it but if you

405
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:11,399
don't spend money on it then things

406
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:14,220
might go wrong but they might not go

407
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,320
wrong for a very long time it might take

408
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,060
a while before it goes wrong but

409
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,920
eventually it will

410
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,380
um and we as security people we know

411
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,019
this but of course the management and

412
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:27,660
and uh people around us might feel

413
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,519
differently they might say well you know

414
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,500
you want me to spend all this money on a

415
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,199
scene but we don't have a SIM now and

416
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:36,000
we're fine

417
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
yeah that's because you can see what's

418
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,920
happening on your network because you

419
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,779
don't have a team

420
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:43,440
um

421
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,360
so that's one of the travels that that

422
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,639
I've I've noticed that we we all tend to

423
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:50,339
run into and like I said earlier we all

424
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:53,459
care we care a lot we care about your

425
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:55,440
security so of course I've used this

426
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,259
line because it's kind of like a thing

427
00:16:58,259 --> 00:16:59,820
we hear a lot from sales people your

428
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,279
security is important to us uh so that's

429
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:04,140
that's why I kind of tell my cheek use

430
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:08,160
it here but for US security people the

431
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,900
security of the organization we work for

432
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,559
is actually important we really care and

433
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:16,439
sometimes I think we care too much

434
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:18,299
um sometimes we should just take a step

435
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:19,799
back and go

436
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:22,380
hey it's your company it's your

437
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,740
organization it's your decision

438
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,059
um

439
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:29,100
um of course you can only do this if you

440
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,320
don't have any contractual uh courses

441
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,660
that say you're responsible for anything

442
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,039
my advice would also be never to sign

443
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,900
such a contract unless you also get a

444
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,059
budget and mandate because there is no

445
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,440
such thing as responsibility without

446
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,360
budget or mandate in my eyes but hey

447
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,100
that's a whole different topic

448
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,140
um but that's my thing my point here is

449
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,299
we care we care a lot and that's good

450
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:50,900
but it's sometimes we care too much

451
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,179
and another issue that we tend to run

452
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:58,260
into is that people I already laughing

453
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,780
people tend to find that we are doom

454
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,200
thinkers we are people that always

455
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,820
assume the worst and I'm laughing

456
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,640
because that's what you pay us for

457
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,820
you pay us to assume the worst right it

458
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,500
would be bad in security to always

459
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,780
assume the most positive outcome of

460
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:19,200
things this is inherent to a a job that

461
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,140
we do that's about risk and risk is is

462
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,799
you know inherently something that's not

463
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:27,840
assuming the most positive outcome it's

464
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,480
actually assessing the most likely

465
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,220
outcome

466
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,340
um you know I Impact versus probability

467
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,620
and uh you know that means there is no

468
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,020
such thing as a positive risk in

469
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:44,460
security right so um so we tend to be to

470
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,380
be made out as Doom thinkers in our

471
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,020
organization where we yell fire but no

472
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:52,980
one sees the smoke uh and and that's

473
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,720
yeah that makes our job harder because

474
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,820
when people do listen to us again

475
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,700
nothing happens and that's the that's

476
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,679
actually the good thing but when they

477
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,120
don't and something does happen they

478
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,559
look at us and go why did you not worry

479
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,600
me

480
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,039
so that's uh something I'm gonna get

481
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:09,660
back to you in a bit as well

482
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,700
and we are always seen as blocking you

483
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,740
know security says no we can't do this

484
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,080
because security is uh blocking this

485
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,900
project I can go into this for ages but

486
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,280
of course we know this is usually

487
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,380
because we get involved right at the

488
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,419
very end of a project and they go well

489
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:26,580
look at our perfectly beautiful design

490
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,039
please say it's perfect from security

491
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,600
standpoint that we just look at it and

492
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,840
go my God what a dumpster fire is this

493
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,000
um and then we say well you're not going

494
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,200
to want to do it this way and they go

495
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,419
well we already build it so yeah there's

496
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:41,880
that stop blocking us please think from

497
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,460
a business standpoint which is quite

498
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,440
hard if you're only involved at the end

499
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,059
of a project

500
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:49,980
and I've also noticed that we get very

501
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,200
little praise again because if any if we

502
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,740
do our jobs well nothing happens

503
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,179
everything works as designed everything

504
00:19:57,179 --> 00:19:59,760
works as you want it to work because we

505
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,520
do our jobs and and no one when

506
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,080
everything works as it's supposed to

507
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,299
feels the the need to go to your

508
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:08,460
security or even your I.T people and go

509
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,640
pat on the back you've done a great job

510
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,200
whilst when things go wrong they're

511
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,000
we're the first people they they knock

512
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,860
on the doors off and that makes our jobs

513
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:20,640
you know I think quite hard where if you

514
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,080
have a job where you make like a product

515
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,480
and the product's done and it looks all

516
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,640
pretty and shiny and and perfect and

517
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,500
everyone will go well look what a great

518
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,780
job you've done well when we do a great

519
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,679
job

520
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,760
nothing happens

521
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,799
um and another another thing and I think

522
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:40,080
this is the single most important reason

523
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,140
why so many intersect people get

524
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,840
um a burnout or depression or that kind

525
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,860
of thing

526
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,860
it's because it's very hard to

527
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,980
prioritize insecurity right so every

528
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,320
single detail is important if you miss

529
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,260
one little configuration mistake or one

530
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,500
little bug or whatever in code

531
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,600
that's all it takes to get your entire

532
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,299
organization around somewhere and I know

533
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:08,760
this is kind of cliche because of course

534
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,559
there's you know you put layers in your

535
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,299
security and you have different measures

536
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:13,860
and Technical and awareness and

537
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:17,220
everything but still sometimes there's

538
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,200
it's just one little detail that you've

539
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,820
missed that can get your entire

540
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,520
organization uh hacked or ransomware or

541
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,299
broken and we know this and that's why

542
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:30,120
it's very hard for us when things are

543
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,580
brought to us to make a priority a prior

544
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,679
priority list of what should I do first

545
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:37,020
what's the worst thing I need to tackle

546
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,700
right now because everything is

547
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,740
important and that thing that you

548
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,260
thought was not important might actually

549
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,780
end up being the downfall of your

550
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,059
organization to be your career dream

551
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:49,380
thinker

552
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,220
um

553
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,860
and I think that's what I find in my in

554
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,600
my job that's one of the hardest things

555
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,419
because I know when I skip something or

556
00:21:57,419 --> 00:21:59,220
when I park something and go I'll go

557
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,960
I'll get back to that later because I

558
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,159
have something more important right now

559
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,620
and that thing becomes the thing that

560
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,020
that causes a lot of issues I'm gonna

561
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,840
have to explain to others that will go

562
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,700
why did you not do something about it it

563
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,980
was right there yes because I had this

564
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,960
whole entire other list of things that

565
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,880
was also right there

566
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,740
um so yeah that's I think that's one of

567
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,659
the reasons we get so many burnout and

568
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:23,280
depression in our field

569
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,020
so how do you deal with these things

570
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,900
well I I'm I'm expert in that sense but

571
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,419
I do have some tips that might be useful

572
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:33,419
to you uh um and and I'm not saying it's

573
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:35,580
it's the answer to everything and of

574
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,460
course that's 42 you will know this but

575
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,120
um

576
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,520
like I said earlier just when things get

577
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,500
too much you know it's not it's not all

578
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,900
your responsibility there's co-workers

579
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,400
there's your board there's your

580
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,460
management there's your CEOs it's not

581
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,220
all you and sometimes it might feel that

582
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,380
way but it really isn't and please

583
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:58,620
remind yourself sometimes that it isn't

584
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,299
um and what might help is to because

585
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:01,799
like I said earlier we don't get a lot

586
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:04,559
of Praise so maybe it can help to make

587
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,159
your work more measurable to uh document

588
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,919
what you do on a daily basis to write

589
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:13,559
reports about your security team or the

590
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,419
work you do for your security team or

591
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:17,700
show them statistics of the the

592
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,460
incidents that you've responded to

593
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,500
um the the evaluations that you've

594
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,419
planned or the policies that you've

595
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:26,520
changed make it more measurable because

596
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,220
that way people will more easily see all

597
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,679
the things you've done and it might help

598
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,840
you get some praise that you clearly

599
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,460
might deserve

600
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,260
I'm just going to say you're not super

601
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,960
human this is the response to the to the

602
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,780
part I said about prioritizing there's

603
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,600
only so much you can do you are one

604
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,299
person or you are one team

605
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:51,299
um usually security people tend to cope

606
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:55,559
with uh capacity issues just remind

607
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:58,799
yourself you're not superhuman and old

608
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,200
people can can actually

609
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:01,880
um

610
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,919
say to you when when things go wrong is

611
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:08,039
that you've done all you've that was in

612
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:09,480
your power to do

613
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,700
and you cannot be expected to do any

614
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,960
more than that

615
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,059
uh like I said earlier make sure you

616
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:17,760
document the things you do your whatever

617
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,740
effort you put into things actually

618
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,720
matters more than perfection in my view

619
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,580
at least

620
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,580
um when it comes to to projects uh this

621
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:30,059
is of course a very open door but um has

622
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:32,700
to be involved from the beginning

623
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,220
um we all we always obviously do but I

624
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,020
think sometimes infosec people are too

625
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,900
modest and they say well I'll I'll see

626
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,940
I'll get back to your project when

627
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,679
there's a design or something like that

628
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,840
and I think it might be better if you

629
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,840
notice that this is causing you trouble

630
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,120
um to get more involved

631
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,640
and I think a little bit of this is also

632
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,740
acceptance so you're gonna have to

633
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,559
accept that things just are the way they

634
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,840
are in infosec sometimes and there's not

635
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,419
very much you can do about it

636
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:06,840
uh and I would like to uh semi end my

637
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:10,020
talk with this quote from uh a person

638
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,419
Discord you've probably already seen a

639
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:15,419
lot of times it's from a former FBI uh I

640
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:17,400
think it's a director but I I really

641
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,200
love it security is always too much

642
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,600
until today it's not enough

643
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,000
now in the beginning I talked to you it

644
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,260
says questions but I have five minutes

645
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,820
left so I'm gonna I'm gonna speed

646
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,960
through it and if you have more

647
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,120
questions feel free to ask them on

648
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,100
Twitter or

649
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:32,820
um

650
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,679
you know approach me on LinkedIn

651
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:36,179
whatever you want I'm gonna show you my

652
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:38,640
Twitter handle in a little bit but uh in

653
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,900
the beginning of the presentation I

654
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,460
asked you to kind of make an estimate of

655
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,960
what a glass of water like this would

656
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,880
weigh and if it's a trick question

657
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,340
obviously because who this is not even a

658
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,020
picture I took myself

659
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,659
the if you know this then uh then

660
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:53,520
they're good for you but uh it's a very

661
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,520
old uh story about a teacher that goes

662
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,960
to a class and he has a glass of water

663
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,880
in his hands and he says how much does

664
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,559
this passive Waterway and obviously you

665
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,360
get students saying all sorts of ways

666
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,980
and then in the end he says well

667
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,679
actually the the the accurate weight of

668
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,900
this glass of water is not important it

669
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,900
doesn't matter all because if I hold

670
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,820
this glass of water in the air for like

671
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:18,659
five minutes or minutes it's it's you

672
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:20,580
know it doesn't matter what it waste but

673
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,900
if you're trying to hold on to the glass

674
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,880
of water for longer than five minutes

675
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,500
it's gonna be heavier and heavier and

676
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,600
heavier and if you hold it for over an

677
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,980
hour it's going to be almost impossible

678
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,080
to keep it in the air any longer because

679
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,200
it's going to be so heavy and that's the

680
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,179
same with certain things in info

681
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:39,000
security if you deal with them mentally

682
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,860
and it's helped me immensely all you

683
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,380
have to do when it gets to be too much

684
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:46,380
is to put the glass down and the weight

685
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:49,320
of it will be off your arm and it's the

686
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,140
same with these issues from you might be

687
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,659
struggling with if it gets too much and

688
00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:56,279
you notice there's nothing you can do

689
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:59,159
people won't listen to you

690
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:02,279
um you can't get anything to change then

691
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:04,320
what's the point of keep keep holding on

692
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,779
to the glass right there's no point just

693
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:09,900
put the glass down and move on and

694
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,539
that's what I would like to give to you

695
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:15,500
a surviving security

696
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,000
uh again if you I'm sorry you're not

697
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,500
going to be able to answer to ask any

698
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,940
questions I can't really see them I

699
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,500
think anyway because I can't see the
