1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,060
so hold on to your hats and be very

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,980
careful with your phones ladies and

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,020
gentlemen Philip Ingram

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,480
and thank you very much indeed

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:09,840
um

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,340
[Applause]

7
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,980
what what can I say to that well you

8
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,299
know you've got an Irishman standing

9
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:18,119
here at a bear Farmers event and it's

10
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,520
dry Tober if ever the planning has gone

11
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,320
wrong I've got the planning badly wrong

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,939
because I'm unfortunately doing dry

13
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:25,140
sober

14
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,720
um all this Tech that's around

15
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,460
whenever I talk to Chief information

16
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,399
security officers or anything else I

17
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,739
will find a way of getting into a

18
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:36,960
network getting the data that I want

19
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,780
getting people to do what I want and

20
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,540
none of the tech here will identify any

21
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,300
of it because what do I do

22
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,820
I hacked the person I hack the serotonin

23
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,620
a little bit more about that in a second

24
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,840
right the hardware

25
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,440
we've all got it it's stuck inside there

26
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,000
um you don't need to read all the bits

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,020
and pieces that are in there but

28
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,879
effectively that's the hardware that

29
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:01,980
processes everything that we do uh

30
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,780
whether it be typing on the on these

31
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,459
sorts of things or interacting with each

32
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:06,960
other I'm trying to get in the position

33
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,000
where I'm not standing in front of that

34
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,340
um so people people can see it so we all

35
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,659
know what the hardware is we've heard of

36
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:13,860
the brain we've heard of everything else

37
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,479
what's the software that runs it

38
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,100
it's the chemicals there are four main

39
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,939
chemicals that are used to highlight our

40
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:25,080
mood

41
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,659
our warm and fuzzy feelings make us feel

42
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:28,619
good

43
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:31,259
our pain and pleasure and again feel

44
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:34,380
good hormones and it's manipulating that

45
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,079
element of the software that allows

46
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:41,220
people like me to get people like you to

47
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,140
do things that you may not necessarily

48
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,479
want to do but you may not necessarily

49
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:48,360
realize that you're doing it

50
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,920
I'm looking at the edge of the audience

51
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,960
there's one or two here might understand

52
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,579
some of the things they're going to

53
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,439
bring up in a minute but some don't so

54
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,439
input output in in the modern era

55
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,880
um we all know the input that's there we

56
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,500
don't get Cloud input in into here

57
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,720
unfortunately there's no USB ports to

58
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,640
put things in we can't plug cables in

59
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,560
but modern input is coming through

60
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,660
everything through social media we are

61
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,520
being bombarded

62
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,520
minute by minute through social media

63
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,099
and through the devices that everyone is

64
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:19,620
carrying um today

65
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,060
um I'll I'll come into a little bit of

66
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,800
history in a minute uh and our output

67
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,900
our output is what we do

68
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,000
um but what does that mean

69
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,860
um well if we start to look at some of

70
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,000
the theories and stuff that they're

71
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,340
behind it there there are two academics

72
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,099
that I have a look at there's Dr Michael

73
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:38,220
Kozinski who did his PhD at Cambridge

74
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,140
University and looked at the impact of

75
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,640
big data and looked at what you could

76
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,860
actually work out from a big data

77
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,400
perspective about how people thought

78
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,860
what people's interactions were and he

79
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,560
didn't just look at Big Data related to

80
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,420
an individual he looked at the Big Data

81
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,000
related to the individual's first degree

82
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,180
contacts second degree contacts looked

83
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,580
at what motivated people looked at what

84
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,379
they reacted to and looked at how he

85
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:07,260
could potentially manipulate that

86
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,760
um some of the findings of what he came

87
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,319
out in some of you may have heard of the

88
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,000
Cambridge analytica Scandal that

89
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,519
happened where there was influence into

90
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,540
elections and other things that

91
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,220
accusations were going on

92
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,900
um and political parties getting this

93
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,060
big data and analyzing how they could

94
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,120
tune their messages to get them focused

95
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,260
into

96
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,180
um individuals in a way that would make

97
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,180
them more susceptible to want to follow

98
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,400
those political viewpoints

99
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,980
and then back a little bit further

100
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,440
Victor Dan true apologies for my

101
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,260
pronunciation Bucharest University wrote

102
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,540
a fantastic book on manipulative

103
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,299
marketing persuasion and manipulating

104
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:47,940
the customer through advertising

105
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,260
everything I'm going to say there's

106
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,060
nothing new about it it's just a

107
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,680
development of things that have been

108
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,540
going on for years

109
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,340
um and here's the bit that's going to

110
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,379
test people's ages and what's going on

111
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:00,360
some of the phrases and things most

112
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,700
people should know I'm loving it it's up

113
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,040
there at McDonald's it's sit there

114
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,700
um

115
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,159
who believes that you can hear a cigar

116
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,280
or the music for a cigar Hamlet if I say

117
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,400
hamlet or hear bread if I say Hovis

118
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,440
we've got the Hovis tune

119
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,540
hands up to dishes

120
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,699
fairy liquid

121
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:23,100
four years advertising has been trying

122
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,020
to find catchphrases and slogans that

123
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,820
will sit in people's minds it's

124
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,160
interesting I came up with lots of

125
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,080
historical examples here because

126
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,060
advertising today is not very good

127
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,400
they're not coming up with the phrases

128
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,900
that sit in the back of your mind that

129
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,120
have stayed with me since I was

130
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,860
about it and believe me that was a long

131
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,940
long long long long long long long long

132
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,680
long

133
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,940
time ago

134
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,699
um and why well I put that why down to

135
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:49,560
we're all carrying this and things get

136
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,660
targeted at you you know how many times

137
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,520
as you go through Facebook and I know

138
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,440
Facebook's for old fogies like me as

139
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,300
well if you go through Facebook and you

140
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,460
get an advert about something popping up

141
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,780
that you've just looked after you've

142
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,160
Googled or you've put through another

143
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,020
search and you you're getting the

144
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,460
retargeted advertising coming through

145
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,380
they don't need to come up with catares

146
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,820
anymore because

147
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,520
the big companies know how you think

148
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,740
they know what you want to see and

149
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,180
they're feeding that to you directly

150
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,580
much more cost effective than providing

151
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,160
a catch raise that hits the masses and

152
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,900
everything else mind you these these

153
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,220
were bloody good and some of the little

154
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,720
dits that went around with it if you

155
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,740
ever get the chance to look at them on

156
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,759
YouTube

157
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,699
um are are fantastic and um you know the

158
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:31,620
lady loves milk tray a friend of mine

159
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,180
was in the British Special Forces

160
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,000
special Boat Service his wife was a

161
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,919
doctor on a prison ship of pool Harbor

162
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,979
he led a royal Navy Royal marine Special

163
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:43,500
boot service diving team and he used to

164
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,479
take his team out practicing uh to the

165
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,520
milk tray advert he'd break on board the

166
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,740
prison ship he'd go to his wife's office

167
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,780
he'd leave a box of milk tray with a

168
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,520
little card on it and leave with his

169
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,840
team off the ship without getting caught

170
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,320
it was a bit of fun

171
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:58,919
um

172
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:00,900
I've said the why it's a modern feeds

173
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,820
we're getting everything fed to us on a

174
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,740
minute by minute basis on a second by

175
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,120
second basis

176
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,160
um and all of the little symbols that

177
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,500
are behind there as we know well are

178
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,419
analyzing every single thing that we

179
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:14,039
click on every time we say accept

180
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:16,199
cookies every time we

181
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:19,020
um go go into something uh through an

182
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,820
app whether we've accepted the cookies

183
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,560
or anything else we don't know what that

184
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,900
app's doing in collecting the data off

185
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,300
our devices and you know how big's a

186
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,039
memory in your device how much do you

187
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,680
process on this device from work or

188
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,380
personally or anything else how do you

189
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,780
how would you like it if anyone could

190
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,280
have access to all of your personal

191
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,340
texts all of your personal emails all of

192
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,139
your personal WhatsApp messages or

193
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:45,000
anything else there are organizations

194
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,919
out there that could have access to that

195
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:49,020
without any problems whatsoever no

196
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,539
matter how you close it down

197
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:54,240
so what I'm talking about here really is

198
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,979
the power of influence

199
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:59,160
and with the power of influence is an

200
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,720
excellent no the net with the power of

201
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,199
influence I remember as a youngster

202
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,940
whenever you get bullied in the

203
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,220
playground at school I go back home and

204
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,319
my mother would say sticks and stones

205
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,300
will break your bones but words will

206
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,400
never harm you

207
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,199
how wrong was she

208
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:18,780
we just have to look at what happened in

209
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,460
the Capitol Building after the Trump

210
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,919
election where people died

211
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:27,539
words incited people words on the on

212
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:30,720
social media words broadcast over

213
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,819
um our devices that are there getting

214
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,039
out of the masses resulting in action

215
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,840
and that action resulted in people's

216
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,160
deaths it also um has resulted in uh

217
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,340
people reacting in very strange ways 5G

218
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,680
spreads covered so we'll burn the 5G

219
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,880
Taurus down

220
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,660
physical destruction words

221
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,180
the anti-vaxxers and there may be some

222
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,979
here and all the rest of it

223
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:57,780
um that's that's your personal views but

224
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,360
the information that's been put out a

225
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,639
lot of it is fundamentally wrong and

226
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,680
deliberately designed to be wrong to

227
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,479
cause people to react in a certain way

228
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,520
and actually for a lot of the groups

229
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,759
that big data analyst analysis that

230
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,860
understanding the individuals you target

231
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,680
a lot of the anti-vaxxing messages that

232
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,699
are coming through through all the

233
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:19,620
social media feeds and other news feeds

234
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,199
at people who you know were wobbling

235
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:24,300
and you turn them slightly and you get

236
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,919
them to support a little bit more and

237
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,539
you turn some of their friends and it

238
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:29,460
leads to another bit and that and that

239
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,780
that continues

240
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,299
U.S elections are mentioned um and your

241
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:34,860
physical violence on people dying at the

242
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,820
end of it

243
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,219
um the fuel crisis that happened about

244
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:40,500
18 months ago two two years ago

245
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,820
um a lot of that was down to

246
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,039
disinformation

247
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,480
and people spreading it as

248
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,220
misinformation disinformation I'll come

249
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,260
up with the definitions in a second but

250
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,540
there wasn't actually a crisis the

251
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,580
crisis was caused because everyone

252
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,560
decided to go and

253
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,140
fill up at once and keep their tanks

254
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,420
full and the supply chain was a just in

255
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,300
time supply chain that got overwhelmed

256
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,580
because there wasn't that spare capacity

257
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,800
to meet the massive surge that came in

258
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,120
because people said there was going to

259
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,339
be a massive fuel crisis and that took

260
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:12,360
time

261
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,620
um it didn't help that there were tanker

262
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,180
driver shortages and various other

263
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,860
things but that took time for the

264
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,480
industry to react and get us through the

265
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,860
fuel crisis there's plenty of fuel

266
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,720
around the country if people have just

267
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,100
continued doing what they'd always done

268
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,660
there wouldn't have been a crisis when

269
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,959
that happened and we find a lot of those

270
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:30,959
that we rely on as accurate sources of

271
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,300
information spin this our politicians

272
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,740
are great if they think that they can

273
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,080
get a political one over

274
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,360
um the the other party they'll spin it

275
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,399
they'll push it out there is that right

276
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:43,800
I'm not going to answer that

277
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,899
um so what's it all about I've sort of

278
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:47,100
talked about it disinformation

279
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,920
misinformation deception fake news and

280
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,899
there's the original quote which didn't

281
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:54,000
say never harm me but it goes back to

282
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,180
1862 1862 we didn't have

283
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,920
um connectivity in the way that we have

284
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,480
today

285
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,940
um it goes back even further

286
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,580
Sun Tzu the great 6th Century Chinese

287
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,519
philosopher and General in his book The

288
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:11,519
Art of War wrote that all Warfare is

289
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,800
based on Deception all deception is

290
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,620
Warfare Donald Trump redefined

291
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,120
deceptions fake news

292
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,500
uh there's nothing new about this

293
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,720
whatsoever and if you look at a lot of

294
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,100
what's going on in the Ukraine conflict

295
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,500
at the moment uh between Russia Ukraine

296
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,180
and the International Community and all

297
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,040
the rest there's an awful lot of fake

298
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,600
news there's a lot of deception there's

299
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,519
an awful lot of trying to Bluff people

300
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,200
and get people to think that you're

301
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,339
doing something different to you

302
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:39,019
actually are is going on there

303
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,640
it's a Russian thing I mentioned the

304
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,779
Ukraine war

305
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:43,980
um it's interesting the Russians have

306
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,019
actually got a Doctrine um for for this

307
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:48,420
called maskarovka It's All About masking

308
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,760
it's all about putting doubt out there

309
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,279
so that if something happens it wasn't

310
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,959
us gov it must have been something else

311
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,920
a classic a few years ago the novichok

312
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,860
attack on Sergey scripal the Russian

313
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,720
Former Intelligence officer who was a

314
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,779
British spy in Salisbury

315
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:07,500
um

316
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,660
why was he chosen he was chosen because

317
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,279
he lives in Salisbury

318
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,380
and Putin didn't like him and wanted to

319
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,519
get rid of him and everything else but

320
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:15,899
he was chosen because he lived in

321
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:18,480
Salisbury because Putin wanted to send a

322
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,459
message out to the oligarchs that were

323
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:22,320
not supporting him in his presidential

324
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,360
election it happened exactly 10 days

325
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,000
before his last presidential election he

326
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,100
was sending a message what why did he

327
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,540
choose Salisbury because just outside

328
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,640
Salisbury is the British chemical

329
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,320
defense establishment

330
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,779
um at Port and down whenever Theresa May

331
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,160
the then prime minister stood up in

332
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,480
Parliament and went

333
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,700
it was the Russians gov and we're

334
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,980
calling you out Vladimir Putin came back

335
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,800
and said it was a dust how dare the

336
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,019
British accuse us of this heinous crime

337
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:51,480
it's escaped from their establishment at

338
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,579
Port and down immediately we find

339
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,440
parliamentarians on the other side of

340
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,940
the house turning around and asking

341
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,560
questions in the houses of Parliament

342
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,240
saying oh how do we know what was the

343
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,380
Russians how do we know it didn't escape

344
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,000
from Port and down have we looked at

345
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,320
this surely we shouldn't be calling them

346
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,000
out and whilst that was happening

347
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,740
Vladimir Putin was sitting behind his

348
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:11,760
very large oak desk with a big Russian

349
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,820
crystal glass filled with the best vodka

350
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,339
over ice and a white cat on his knee and

351
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:19,500
was stroking it going yes other people

352
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,500
are doing my job for me it's throwing

353
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,959
people off the scent it's causing that

354
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,120
questioning in people's minds it's

355
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,220
manipulating the thinking for an effect

356
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,740
and therefore what does that do it stops

357
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,480
the direct action necessarily happening

358
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,300
in a way that could have hurt him very

359
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,100
early on and he then get some building

360
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,079
and goes and does other things

361
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,079
like invade Ukraine again

362
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:44,820
um

363
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,160
we were good at it once we were bloody

364
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,480
good at it once second world war

365
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,339
Operation Fortitude if you've never read

366
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:52,139
about Operation Fortitude go and read

367
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:53,880
about it a very early part of that was

368
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,620
another operation cooperation mincemeat

369
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,000
there's a movie out about operation

370
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,620
mincemeat and that was all about a dead

371
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,019
body being uh pushed off a submarine

372
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:03,060
with top secret plans on it saying that

373
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,440
the Allies were going to invade southern

374
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,320
Europe through Greece and not through

375
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,060
Italy to try and convince Hitler of that

376
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,940
Hitler believed it but when it came to

377
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,339
convincing the Germans that we weren't

378
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:17,279
going to invade Europe through Normandy

379
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,019
but we were going to invade through the

380
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:22,200
paracale we created a false Army uh the

381
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,760
false Army those false press reports

382
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,160
went out about it there was uh there

383
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,779
were false aircraft there were wooden

384
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:29,399
aircraft built there were blow up tanks

385
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:31,139
built there was a real commander who

386
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:33,839
went around meeting some real troops

387
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,639
there were radio Transmissions that were

388
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:36,779
going on that were real radio

389
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:38,760
Transmissions they'd just been recorded

390
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,680
from other exercises and other bits

391
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,320
spliced into them it was all designed to

392
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,700
create this impression that there was

393
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,440
this big army and and one of the

394
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,820
commanders of this at the beginning was

395
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,560
was Patton

396
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,360
um so General Patton uh with himself

397
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,399
brought a degree of credibility Hitler

398
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,139
believed that we were going to come in

399
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:57,240
through the paracale even after the

400
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,760
Normandy Landings had started so he kept

401
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,019
his

402
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:02,940
um armored formations in reserve up

403
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,920
around there expecting to defend that

404
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,420
which allowed the Allies to get the

405
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,680
bridge head which allowed that

406
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,420
Bridgehead to be developed which allowed

407
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,180
eventually the Germans to be defeated

408
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,519
um across Europe deception it's an

409
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:16,019
integral part of warfare it's an

410
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:18,899
integral part of everything that goes on

411
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,120
um it's not just military and it's not

412
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,339
just politics the Securities and

413
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:25,079
Exchange Commission outlined and that's

414
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:27,899
2017 there's reports every year where

415
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:30,540
the manipulation of news around

416
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,579
different things in the markets can be

417
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:36,079
used to influence share prices

418
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,660
cryptocurrency Elon Musk Bitcoin win

419
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,760
like that when Elon turned around and

420
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,560
said hey you can buy Teslas with Bitcoin

421
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,019
now I like Bitcoin and then

422
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,940
was it a week or was it 10 days later he

423
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,680
said I don't like Bitcoin anymore

424
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,899
um I I want something else on bitcoin

425
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:54,660
price tanked manipulating the market

426
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,880
through the use of information

427
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,959
influencers doing that knowing what's

428
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:00,380
going on

429
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:03,199
so misinformation disinformation

430
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,579
misinformation is false information

431
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:08,100
that's spread without an intent you

432
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,540
don't know it's false you think oh

433
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,160
that's good all right oh we'll have to

434
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,779
tell everyone you tell everyone and

435
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,339
you've got you you you're just passing

436
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:16,560
it around but it's wrong

437
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,320
disinformation is slightly more Sinister

438
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,959
that's where you know it's wrong

439
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:23,820
but you deliberately put it around for

440
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,860
an effect so you know that if you pass

441
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,880
that

442
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,220
incorrect information Ron it's going to

443
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,899
cause people to think differently to

444
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:32,820
react differently to do to do something

445
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,560
that they wouldn't necessarily do and

446
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,399
come out and support you

447
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:40,079
an open question are our politicians

448
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,880
doing this on a daily basis do they

449
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,260
actually tell us the truth or do they

450
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,300
work in purely disinformation should it

451
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,519
be legal I don't think it should

452
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,220
um so disinformation is knowingly spread

453
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,620
spreading misinformation

454
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,899
um for foreign effect

455
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:56,880
uh very quickly propaganda it's

456
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,279
disinformation but the the effect is

457
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,620
created by a government or or a big body

458
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,420
for for a political effect or a military

459
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,180
effectors or or something else

460
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,940
um so who's doing it we know some of the

461
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,800
people that do this and they fall into

462
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,019
various little categories oh we've got

463
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:15,240
the armchair expert how many people

464
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,040
you're sitting there on Twitter they

465
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,839
um knew everything about SARS the the

466
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:21,300
the covert the covert pandemic that was

467
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,199
going on

468
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:24,600
um they knew everything about the um the

469
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,399
later Cyber attack has happened all of a

470
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,660
sudden they're experts on the Ukraine

471
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,339
conflict that's going on at the moment

472
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:31,380
um and next they'll be experts on uh the

473
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,120
international energy crisis and they're

474
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,399
putting stuff out there yeah they think

475
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:36,660
they know everything

476
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,579
um they're spreading misinformation in

477
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:40,019
many cases because you know they're

478
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:42,600
putting their information out there

479
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,500
um

480
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,320
The Accidental idiot you know someone

481
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,120
comes in you get a report and you think

482
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,160
hey it's come from someone I like they

483
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,680
say what I enjoy them saying and you put

484
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,600
it out around you're not actually

485
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,699
checking the information before you hit

486
00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:59,820
send and and you you pass it around and

487
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,259
there's an awful lot of accidental

488
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:03,240
idiots out there I'll put my hand in the

489
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,280
air I have been an accidental idiot on

490
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,199
more times than I care to remember and

491
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,699
care to think

492
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:10,859
however this is where you get into the

493
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:12,540
dangerous game we've got the credible

494
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,059
idiot with an agenda I'll put the

495
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:17,459
information out there but I'll put only

496
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:20,099
the bits that support my view and

497
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:21,480
support the effect that I want to

498
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,040
achieve I'll not give the whole story

499
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,380
but it gives that credible bit

500
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,720
back to Russian muskerovka we're in the

501
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,160
same game here you're trying to

502
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,200
manipulate the way people think in

503
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,120
manipulating the way people think it

504
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,280
comes back to that software bit I talked

505
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,620
about of the four feel good hormones

506
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,880
that are going around in your brain

507
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,580
because it's it's those that cause your

508
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,679
brain to process that information in a

509
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,000
way that is either going to make you

510
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,460
react to it and push it out as

511
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,340
misinformation or begin to believe it a

512
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,960
little bit more and you fall into the

513
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,760
game of disinformation and you get into

514
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,900
the game where you think well actually

515
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,480
this is going to further my cause and my

516
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,400
belief and therefore I will put that out

517
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,700
knowing that it's incorrect but it fits

518
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,679
my wider beliefs and hey that's okay

519
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:07,640
because everyone does it

520
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,400
and part of that comes from this what I

521
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,080
describe as self-misinforming group

522
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,900
think so you're sitting there on Twitter

523
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,539
or on any other app and and you're

524
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:20,039
you're having this conversation and

525
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:21,480
someone comes in and they disagree with

526
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,160
you and you have your balance God yeah

527
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,020
and write your backup I just right

528
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,640
that's it blocked

529
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,860
and then the next one that comes in and

530
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,120
comes in with a different view you think

531
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,220
oh I saw that block them and next one

532
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,780
block them then all of a sudden you

533
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,520
suddenly finding your feet you go this

534
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,559
is wonderful everyone's agreeing with my

535
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:39,900
view that's I must be right I've got

536
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,120
I've still got 100 000 followers and

537
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,440
everyone's agreeing with me that's

538
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,700
that's brilliant

539
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,320
well they're only agreeing with you

540
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,520
because you've blocked anyone that

541
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,260
disagrees with you and therefore you're

542
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,120
getting what I call self-misinforming

543
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,220
group think and therefore it may not

544
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,200
necessarily reflect the accuracy of

545
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,240
what's out there uh you're misinforming

546
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,539
yourself how easy in our Busy World with

547
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,700
the devices that we carry around with us

548
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,260
all the time to do that

549
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:08,460
specialists at it

550
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,960
um I apologize if there are any Chinese

551
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,340
Nationals in the audience if there are

552
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,140
any Russian Nationals in the audience or

553
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,539
are there any North Koreans no no hands

554
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:16,980
up I didn't think there would be

555
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,460
um these are the experts at it

556
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,900
these are the experts at it

557
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,120
um Vladimir Putin everything that he

558
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,799
does there is a massive element to it of

559
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:28,080
disinformation of that mascarova piece

560
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,520
that's in there it is part of his

561
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,500
Doctrine it's part of his thinking

562
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,500
um he does it very openly and usually in

563
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,660
many cases not very well the person who

564
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,760
does it very well in many cases and is

565
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,080
working at manipulating it but he's

566
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,360
thinking of it from a long-term 20 25

567
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,179
year perspective is Xi Jinping in China

568
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:47,940
the Chinese are fantastic at slowly

569
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,400
surely just tweaking things

570
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,600
um and of course they've got their

571
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,520
plausibly deniable little bad boy that

572
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,780
they bring out every now and again that

573
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,039
and

574
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:57,960
firing a rocket can be part of a

575
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,580
disinformation campaign

576
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,380
um because you're creating an effect and

577
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,059
then you get a lot of information flying

578
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:04,380
around about it

579
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,539
um he's he's Rocket Man at the moment in

580
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,400
firing things over Japan and influencing

581
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,020
things from that perspective from a

582
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,940
military planning perspective your

583
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,740
effects can be physical they can be

584
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,600
information they can be there's so many

585
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,919
different ways that ways that they can

586
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:17,700
work

587
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,080
um but these These are the Dangerous

588
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,760
Ones and they will manipulate their

589
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,559
little bad boy

590
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,720
um and part of the reason why they're

591
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,760
dangerous is because they can think in

592
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,039
Generations their leaders that are in

593
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,799
place for multiple periods of time he

594
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:33,720
will think 25 years out he's thinking

595
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,220
probably well at the moment he's

596
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,360
probably thinking can I survive next

597
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,440
week but

598
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,780
um that's still longer than our

599
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,980
politicians are thinking because I think

600
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,840
Liz truss is probably thinking can I

601
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,580
survive this afternoon or tomorrow

602
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,220
morning Donald Trump was thinking can I

603
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,320
survive the next tweet and what's going

604
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,140
on and we think in you know ideally in

605
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,520
prime minister over presidential time

606
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,720
frames

607
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,700
um your five years with realistically

608
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,220
three years of actually effort whereas

609
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,440
they're thinking in 20 25 year planning

610
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,760
times and they can put the information

611
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,039
out slowly they can do the analysis and

612
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,919
the big data and the big data that

613
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,380
individuals like he has got in

614
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,200
particular is phenomenal

615
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,039
um

616
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,860
he leech off lots of it but he's he's

617
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,900
he's he's got the most of it

618
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,880
um and when we look at the big data how

619
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,160
many of us have been affected by and the

620
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,660
manipulation of messaging that's going

621
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,460
out how many has been affected by the

622
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,260
real strikes that have happened in

623
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,580
recent weeks

624
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,039
um and months and the way it's buggered

625
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:34,380
us around Vladimir Putin is well aware

626
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,059
of what's going on and is feeding into

627
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:37,919
different individuals and different

628
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,600
organizations

629
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,760
um bits of information that aren't

630
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,200
coming directly from him they're coming

631
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,380
from second third and fourth connections

632
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,940
to try and influence those that are

633
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,020
making the decisions about the rail

634
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,940
strikes how does they know that he's got

635
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,860
some supporters in there well three

636
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,440
senior members of the rmt Union

637
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,280
um

638
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,320
the Russian

639
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,240
symbol that people are wearing inside

640
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,000
Ukraine Alex Gordon's been very open

641
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,039
about what's going on Steve headley's

642
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,900
been extremely open about his

643
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,000
relationships into Russia some of them

644
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,799
have actually visited the separatists in

645
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,020
the donbass region in Ukraine to support

646
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,360
them and Vladimir Putin sit and go hey

647
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,340
this is bliss when they've gone in there

648
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,419
will their Hardware have been

649
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:20,700
compromised where's Ken gone um Ken

650
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,559
Monroe it well it it will have been

651
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,059
compromised has her software been

652
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:25,740
compromised yes has the thinking been

653
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,960
compromised 100 because they're already

654
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,440
one side of the chain and reinforcing

655
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,840
that reinforcing the way the chemical

656
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,580
imbalance or the chemical balance is

657
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,440
working in their brains to reinforce the

658
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,179
way of thinking to make them feel better

659
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:42,480
about this is good for their calls but

660
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,460
where that information is coming from

661
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,080
people do research that and they don't

662
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,120
know it so almost certainly they will

663
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,860
have been being influenced by Vladimir

664
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,659
Putin and it's not just them or not just

665
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:53,280
picking on them it happens with just

666
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,780
about everything that's going on where

667
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,659
there's dissent amongst

668
00:22:57,659 --> 00:22:59,700
um the the uh general population that's

669
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,260
out there because manipulation of

670
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,179
population causing fractures in the

671
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:04,740
population and sticking a political

672
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,360
knife in it and wiggling it to try and

673
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,940
make them bigger is one of Russia's and

674
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:11,039
China's tactics

675
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,400
so why and how well you know asansu said

676
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,500
speed is of the essence

677
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,780
second world war Operation Fortitude the

678
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,700
government controlled all of the

679
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,559
communications you know they controlled

680
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,000
what went into the newspapers we had

681
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,679
editors who spent time it had to be

682
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,080
typed out the physical type print had to

683
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,059
be put in little metal letters and

684
00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:31,860
physically put into the typeset and all

685
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,539
the rest of it nothing could happen that

686
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:34,919
fast

687
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:37,380
um whenever I first went into the

688
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,940
military rollers that we sent letters

689
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,039
you wrote a letter it went the typing

690
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,539
pillar got typed it came back three days

691
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:44,760
later and went in within the post it

692
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,799
came into an entry it came into a file

693
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,299
you read the letter with all the other

694
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:49,740
correspondents that was there you wrote

695
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,000
something back he wanted to put

696
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,620
something out to the masses you got a

697
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:55,460
thing called The gestetner Machine you

698
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:59,039
sniffedner correcting fluid I've sniffed

699
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,120
too much of it that's why I can't speak

700
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,039
and and you get higher than anything

701
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:04,020
else that's on the market at the moment

702
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,820
um but you know it was a hand cranked

703
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,039
machine that doesn't exist now because

704
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:09,960
we've got speed Sun Tzu in the 6th

705
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,760
Century identified speed was of the

706
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,620
essence we've got it

707
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,780
we've got it with this we've got it with

708
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,299
everything that's here and that speed of

709
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:20,100
what is provided by the connectivity

710
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,320
that's here is what has been used to

711
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,820
manipulate the connectivity that's in

712
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,780
here

713
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,520
um to manipulate the software that's

714
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,320
running the hardware to get you to think

715
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,120
a slightly different way to get you to

716
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,740
act a slightly different way to get you

717
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,780
to believe a slightly different way and

718
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,760
actually the two academics that I talked

719
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,600
about

720
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,460
um if you go through their papers they

721
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,080
actually went into detail about how you

722
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,880
could and they'd experimented about how

723
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,320
you could get people to physically

724
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,659
change their beliefs and they went

725
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:47,220
through experiments to prove that you

726
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,840
could do that without them realizing

727
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,059
that it was happening

728
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:53,400
um what are the the the ways of it

729
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,480
coming out what are the countries to it

730
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,980
the troll Farms we've all we've all

731
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,600
heard of as I said he's the expert of

732
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,659
getting control Farms that are around

733
00:24:59,659 --> 00:25:02,100
pressing partiality would expect our

734
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,419
mainstream press to be able to turn

735
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,340
around and give us um information that

736
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,200
we can trust in many cases but it's at

737
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,640
speed it's that speed of getting the the

738
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,159
story out and interestingly the BBC have

739
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:12,179
just started to put out an information

740
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:15,059
campaign to try and suggest that they

741
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:18,539
are putting accuracy ahead of speed ITN

742
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:23,280
at um the Cyber Expo uh in Olympia uh in

743
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,140
September turned around and said they do

744
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,480
accuracy over speed but how many people

745
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,940
look at the mainstream channels or just

746
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,200
look at the feeds that you're happy with

747
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,059
that are coming through and you look at

748
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:35,159
the Press certainly in this country we

749
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:36,539
all know the left-wing papers the right

750
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:38,039
wing papers the ones that are going to

751
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:39,480
spin the stories the way we want them to

752
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,700
be should our should our journalists

753
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,679
actually be putting any opinion in

754
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,299
anything should they be spinning it in

755
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:47,039
any way or just telling us what is going

756
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,740
on and telling us accurately and letting

757
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:52,320
us make our Minds up

758
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,580
um there's a press code of conduct that

759
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,740
says there should be impartiality

760
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,880
um

761
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,039
whether it's adhered to or not I don't

762
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,120
know I've been given the five minute

763
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,760
bill there's only one or two more slides

764
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,720
um

765
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,580
but information and the power of

766
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,320
information we're sitting here at a

767
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,539
technology show and we're talking cyber

768
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:11,039
and other bits and pieces

769
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,860
is it a security issue

770
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,360
who's responsible for it in your

771
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,580
organization who should be responsible

772
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,440
is it the responsibility of those that

773
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,179
enable the connectivity that police the

774
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:22,260
connectivity

775
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,539
where does it sit I would argue that

776
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:26,279
many places don't have that sitting

777
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:27,600
anywhere or sitting in the Commons

778
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,980
Department who've got no idea whatsoever

779
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,840
as to what's going on but when you look

780
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,120
at it from a risk perspective what's one

781
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,799
of the biggest risks to any individual

782
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,840
or any organization reputation

783
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,419
reputation reputation what's the easiest

784
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:41,340
way to damage your reputation get

785
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,179
something wrong in the information

786
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:44,279
domain

787
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:46,440
uh I've written something on my blog

788
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,779
site on hacking your serotonin it goes a

789
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:50,700
little bit more into it but there's so

790
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,559
much more to this that's me I think

791
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,480
we've got about four minutes for

792
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,159
questions if there are any

793
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:04,020
what's the solution to dealing dealing

794
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,760
with all of these problems I think I

795
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,100
think I think well I think there's the

796
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,500
solution as a whole society solution

797
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,720
um and unfortunately it's one where I

798
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,980
think it's going to be very difficult to

799
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,200
bring in I think we need to first of all

800
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,640
educate people from the earliest

801
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,179
possible age that what they see on their

802
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:23,039
device even if it's come from their best

803
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,260
mate or from someone else may not be

804
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,620
true so disbelieve everything until you

805
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,860
can verify it now you'll very quickly be

806
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,260
able to pick up those feeds that you

807
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,120
know someone else is verifying to a

808
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,700
degree that you can accept whether it be

809
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,320
mainstream news whether they be

810
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,820
government feeds whether it be something

811
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,740
else I'll take government Feeds out of

812
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,059
that because we see the the spin that

813
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:46,260
that is happening there front and center

814
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,760
but you'll be able to identify where

815
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,140
you're getting accurate information from

816
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,360
and restrict what you're doing to get

817
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,100
getting that accurate information but

818
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,720
it's it comes under questioning

819
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,620
everything

820
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,179
don't believe a single thing that you're

821
00:27:57,179 --> 00:27:58,140
told

822
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,520
so none of this is true by the way

823
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,919
having said that

824
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,020
anything else

825
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,760
that's what I was going to say um I was

826
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,200
going to ask you it's a bit of a direct

827
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,820
question are you a credible idiot

828
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,520
because

829
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,140
um I've admitted to being a credible

830
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:16,260
idiot so yes okay yeah because

831
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,659
um you mentioned about uh China Russia

832
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:21,419
like all of the obvious uh you know but

833
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:24,240
what about our our own politicians what

834
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,340
what about what about us well what about

835
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,980
like the misinformation that was

836
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,740
knowingly spread and actually worsen the

837
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,720
situations which actually

838
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,820
um worsen the situation so the

839
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,100
misinformation or perhaps disinformation

840
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,919
as you uh probably record it

841
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:43,799
um worsen the situation in in Ukraine I

842
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:46,020
believe yep so is this is this

843
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,100
information what's in the situation

844
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,840
Ukraine from from our program and why

845
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,340
are we not doing anything about it in

846
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,220
terms of legislation well um legislation

847
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,720
legislation is like swimming uphill

848
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,460
against fast flowing treacle it takes

849
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,779
years and years and years for

850
00:28:57,779 --> 00:28:59,279
legislation to cap up catch up with

851
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,679
technology perfect example is the

852
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,559
computer misuse Act

853
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:05,940
1990 how many of the things I talked

854
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,980
about there existed in 1990 apart from

855
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,299
the fairy liquid advert the Hoover's

856
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:12,120
advert the Hamlet advert and other bits

857
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:15,000
and pieces so your legislation is always

858
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,740
playing catch-up

859
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,940
um is it affecting what's going on

860
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,279
Ukraine are we trying to contract yes do

861
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:22,380
we have a capability in the UK to deal

862
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,820
with it in the Minister of Defense yes

863
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,340
it's called 77 Brigade which looks at

864
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,020
psychological operations but that looks

865
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,220
at things from a military perspective

866
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,559
are they good no

867
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:34,020
um we have we lost the operational art

868
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,399
um in the second world war haven't

869
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:37,620
regained it again is it being used by

870
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:40,320
Ukraine and Russia equally yes are

871
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,020
Ukraine good in it yes very very good at

872
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,659
it or Russia good at it yes but they

873
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:47,279
come out with daftar things so it's

874
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,140
easier to spot them in what's going on

875
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,120
but they're so far ahead it's it's

876
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,860
become so ingrained in everything that

877
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,659
we have in society what we're trying to

878
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:56,820
do is take this Genie that has got

879
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,799
everywhere and put it back into the

880
00:29:58,799 --> 00:29:59,940
bottle but we don't know where the

881
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:00,899
bottle is and we don't know where the

882
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:02,700
stopper is and we don't actually know

883
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,100
where the Genies got you so it's a

884
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,020
difficult one and I've just been

885
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:10,080
I've just been told yep just until the

886
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,179
cuts I'm sorry I'll be around afterwards

887
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:13,559
if anyone's got any questions thank you

888
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:16,520
very much indeed for listening
