1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,419
so I'm Natasha and I'm here today to

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:06,240
talk about hacking the echo chamber in

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,700
our industry what that means and and how

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,860
I think we can include and encourage new

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,500
Talent onto the speaker circuit while

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,179
still respecting already established

7
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:16,260
Talent

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,480
so I've been a professional recruiter

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,480
for more than 17 years I'm the founder

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,180
of cyber Talent Partners

11
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:24,779
um

12
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:26,699
which is a specialist cyber security

13
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:29,880
Recruitment consultancy and so I've

14
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,679
worked in the industry for almost five

15
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,500
years now and I honestly absolutely love

16
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,899
it I love the community that surrounds

17
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:39,780
us I love the everyday learning and as

18
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,820
I've progressed in this space I've

19
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,980
started to get more involved in speaking

20
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,320
opportunities both virtually and in

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,379
person and I'm here today because I want

22
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,480
to see more people like me who have

23
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,600
limited public speaking experience to be

24
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,820
included and encouraged to come forward

25
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,100
and share their unique views and

26
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,760
experiences

27
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,040
so what do I mean by the echo chamber

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,780
and and how does this relate to our

29
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,220
industry

30
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,960
so as I say I've been in the industry

31
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,360
for for almost five years now

32
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,799
um and I've been attending various

33
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,640
webinars talks and conferences Etc

34
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,680
and one of the major concerns that I

35
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,840
have is that often the opinions and

36
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,580
solutions that we're hearing are just so

37
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,580
so similar from one event to the next

38
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,979
and actually what what we're not seeing

39
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:31,740
enough of perhaps is enough

40
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,080
real solutions we're circling a lot

41
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,939
around similar similar challenges and

42
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:37,200
actually if those challenges didn't

43
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,540
exist then we wouldn't be discussing

44
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,000
them from one event to the next

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,979
and another concern is that if we don't

46
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,979
seek to challenge those opinions and

47
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:49,380
learn from different perspectives

48
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,140
ideas or ways of thinking then actually

49
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,140
how does our industry progress you know

50
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,540
in standing up to threats

51
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,759
and how do we learn so that we can

52
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,040
Implement better practices better

53
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,119
processes or even Solutions and as an

54
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:08,280
industry that's ever evolving you know

55
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,979
our ideas our experiences our thoughts

56
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,800
our opinions also need to keep Pace with

57
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,980
this

58
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,000
so

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,340
how do we get out of the echo chamber

60
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,739
and and and how does diversity of

61
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:25,620
thought actually play its part in this

62
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,540
in my opinion we need to courage

63
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,520
encourage diversity of thought that

64
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,920
essentially brings in opinions and

65
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,680
experiences from outside of our bubble

66
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,720
you know that give us insight into

67
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,640
knowledge and perspectives that we may

68
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,440
not already have

69
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,239
and that would just allow us to actually

70
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,459
consider new things from new points of

71
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:45,720
view

72
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,940
and we need to increase the diversity of

73
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,920
what we're hearing that diversity of

74
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,920
experience diversity of perception and

75
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,200
diversity of background

76
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,420
but what I'd like to point out is you

77
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,640
know collectively as an industry we're

78
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,459
making incredible strides in attracting

79
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:04,980
diverse Minds into the industry

80
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,040
and and amazing examples of this is you

81
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,019
know as a recruiter myself

82
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:13,500
over the last 12 18 months or so you

83
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,080
know I've seen incredible career

84
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,239
transitions from career police men and

85
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,379
women from teachers through to retail

86
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:23,940
managers all the way through to

87
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,400
construction workers and these

88
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,319
individuals have transitioned into our

89
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,420
industry without any prior cyber

90
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,819
security experience but what they come

91
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:35,400
with is this incredible or those

92
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,920
incredible transitional skills that I

93
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,720
think often get missed

94
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,760
and they're actually bringing such a

95
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,760
positive impact into our industry

96
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,140
and so

97
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,000
you know what we also have to remember

98
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,159
is that these individuals

99
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,220
are members of our society they're

100
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,080
individuals that have all individually

101
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,120
one way or another either directly or

102
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,000
indirectly been impacted by cyber

103
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,140
breaches

104
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,060
and actually if you think about it often

105
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,560
the worst affected have little

106
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,599
opportunity to really Express what's

107
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,459
going on around them

108
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:10,799
and their diverse experiences in my

109
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,659
opinion can help to enhance that

110
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:14,340
collective intelligence

111
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,100
from problem solving through to you know

112
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,220
sort of coming up with new policies

113
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,139
and I think as a community this

114
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:24,840
incredible community that we are you

115
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,300
know we should be nurturing diversity of

116
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,520
thought we need to encourage more of

117
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,979
that we need to be providing a platform

118
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:34,800
so voices and ideas are heard

119
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,860
um and we need those different ways of

120
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,259
thinking to be able to you know tackle

121
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:42,660
the threats that evolves so quickly

122
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,360
and we need alternative ways of thinking

123
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,380
to really keep ahead

124
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:51,120
so I'd like to share

125
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,560
um an example that really really

126
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,300
resonates with me this is a working

127
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,000
example of where I think

128
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,160
diversity of thought really plays its

129
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,120
part

130
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,280
um in sort of in in a professional

131
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,979
capacity so some of you may or may not

132
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:06,600
have heard of the golden Silence of

133
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,860
Amazon

134
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,199
So within Amazon for the last decade or

135
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:12,060
so they've actually started their

136
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,520
meetings in total silence for the first

137
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,960
30 minutes

138
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,360
so rather than you know

139
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,280
um the senior members of the leadership

140
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,020
team for example actually you know

141
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,500
giving off a PowerPoint presentation

142
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,479
they actually provide members of the

143
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:31,020
meeting with a six-page memo

144
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,400
and

145
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,860
and that sort of summarizes all of the

146
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,660
all of the points from the main agenda

147
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,919
items

148
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,740
what I absolutely love about this is it

149
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,740
it gives the reader the opportunity

150
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,199
to actually form their own opinion of

151
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,460
the agenda

152
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,500
and it forces better thought and

153
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,180
understanding of what points are more

154
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,820
important than others rather than you

155
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,259
know we've all been in meetings before

156
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:56,940
and you know whether they be high level

157
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,979
or low level we've been in meetings

158
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:00,660
where you know often the most senior

159
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,699
person in the room will tell you you

160
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:04,259
know what's going on in the agenda

161
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:06,240
what's coming next and often and

162
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,220
naturally give off their own opinions of

163
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,720
what that is

164
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,880
but what's really powerful about this is

165
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,400
it commits people to deciding what they

166
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,280
think before learning those opinions

167
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,500
and even more powerful is actually the

168
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,199
most senior person speaks last to

169
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,720
protect that diversity of thought

170
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,940
this example really really resonates

171
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,580
with me because I've been in many

172
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,259
situations and I'm sure some of you in

173
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:33,060
the audience will probably feel this as

174
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,039
well where you've either been involved

175
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,780
in a conversation or you've you know

176
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,220
you've been in a meeting or even an

177
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,660
interview

178
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,900
where you know let's say

179
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,520
the person that you're having that

180
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,259
conversation with is more senior than

181
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:49,199
yourself and actually you feel like your

182
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,840
opinion is perhaps invaluable because

183
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,340
you don't have the same level of

184
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,560
experience as them I know I've been

185
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,120
there plenty of times and sometimes

186
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,220
still now and sometimes you just have to

187
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,840
push out that comfort zone a little bit

188
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,419
and have those conversations

189
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:06,360
um but but I think this example is a

190
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,300
great working example

191
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,940
and so

192
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,699
what are the tangible Solutions

193
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:18,000
thinking back to the Amazon example

194
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,680
and as I say what I think is really

195
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,740
powerful about that is that ability to

196
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,139
build your own opinion but not only that

197
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:26,699
to be able to share it in a safe

198
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:28,319
environment

199
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,419
and if I reflect on my own experience

200
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:33,479
speaking on a panel my very first panel

201
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:36,539
I was one of five speakers I was

202
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:39,539
by far the least experienced speaker

203
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:42,419
as I say it was my absolute first time I

204
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:44,280
was a bag of nerves much like I am now

205
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,139
this is my first Solo solo gig

206
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:51,960
and and I remember sitting there

207
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,620
um

208
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,660
and I literally was given a bottle of

209
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,520
water and in this scenario I can't

210
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,840
clutch onto it so you can't see my

211
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,940
trembling hands but I was trembling and

212
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,280
holding this bottle for dear life and

213
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,960
all that was going through my head was

214
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,020
what value do I actually bring who want

215
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,060
you know what if what I'm saying

216
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,819
actually isn't as strong as the people

217
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:14,819
beside me and and I'm just a recruiter

218
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:17,099
what do I really kind of bring to this

219
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:18,660
conversation

220
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,819
and when I reflect on that I think why

221
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:23,160
though did I feel that way

222
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,280
so number one I think the topic

223
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,979
um I wasn't confident it was a little

224
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:30,840
bit out of my comfort zone and I think

225
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,419
that's really important to to kind of

226
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:34,979
digest and remember

227
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:36,839
and the second point is actually the

228
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:39,899
questions in the panel came to me last

229
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:41,339
and

230
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:43,500
and so I'd heard the thoughts and

231
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,380
opinions of everybody else first and so

232
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,720
almost felt like perhaps mine was

233
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,940
invaluable or the

234
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,640
that I didn't have enough experience to

235
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,740
be able to challenge the opinions of my

236
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,600
fellow panelists

237
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,660
but perhaps it's the least experienced

238
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,220
could I've shared my thoughts first

239
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,140
would I felt differently about that

240
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,940
panel

241
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,920
what's really really interesting about

242
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,019
that panel was actually the feedback

243
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:11,760
from the audience

244
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,680
and it wasn't about how good I was or

245
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,540
how good I wasn't

246
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,180
um it was it was actually

247
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,279
really valuable to receive feedback that

248
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:22,320
said you know I really like that you

249
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,459
came from a completely different

250
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:25,980
perspective from everybody else and that

251
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,540
really made me realize that actually

252
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,240
every single one of us including me at

253
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,940
that point and regardless of how much or

254
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,519
how little experience you have as a

255
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,760
speaker on a panel or in a webinar Etc

256
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,399
but actually because you come from a

257
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:43,140
different perspective you bring such a

258
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,060
you know different way of thinking that

259
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,640
is really valuable and I think second to

260
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,839
that as well

261
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,420
is that we all downplay our Professional

262
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,580
Knowledge or experience or wherever that

263
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,700
may be and what capacity that may be

264
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,700
because we we take for granted what we

265
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,640
know versus what we don't know and so

266
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,380
you think that everybody kind of knows

267
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,060
what it is you do as a professional or

268
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,620
your day-to-day and certainly as a

269
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,600
recruiter you know I often think oh

270
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,920
everybody knows what that recruitment

271
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,839
process is most people know how to write

272
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:15,180
a CV actually a lot of people are crying

273
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,620
out for that information because they're

274
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,300
not entirely sure what that should look

275
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,100
like what you know I'm at the coal face

276
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,120
of that as a recruiter and so you know

277
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,300
job Seekers look at look look to me for

278
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,920
that advice in terms of what does a

279
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,560
hiring manager look for Etc

280
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,320
so I guess my point on that is that we

281
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,019
need to ensure that we are inclusive as

282
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:39,240
an industry in every way shape and form

283
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,700
but that we can attract more diverse

284
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,399
Minds onto our stages and screens we're

285
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,560
crying out for that

286
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,660
um and we need to nurture confidence by

287
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:52,560
encouraging less experienced speakers to

288
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,360
us you know in in

289
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,019
an example of a panel for example we

290
00:10:58,019 --> 00:10:59,820
need to encourage those less experienced

291
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,279
speakers to actually be able to speak on

292
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:04,980
specific points that they have raised in

293
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,720
earlier preparations

294
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,240
which would give them convictions in

295
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,860
their own points raised and I kind of

296
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,920
wish I'd had that in my first experience

297
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,200
but I can only reflect on that

298
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,019
and and again in the example of a panel

299
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:21,839
discussion you know with that in mind we

300
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,720
get to hear specific points raised from

301
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,640
different perspectives rather than

302
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,620
variations of the same point which is

303
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,560
often what we hear in panels and some

304
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,019
webinars and what have you

305
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:36,779
what I think is also really important is

306
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,180
dynamic panel moderation

307
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:42,540
for example we often ask our best placed

308
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,700
experts to provide their opinion on

309
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,380
specific topics

310
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,540
but I think what we need is moderators

311
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,640
to you know to encourage the various

312
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,940
different viewpoints and and challenges

313
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,720
to the opinions of the rest of the panel

314
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,820
um an example of that and and sort of

315
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,800
that in working progress is the last

316
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,820
panel I did also at DTX up in Manchester

317
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,700
um which was moderated by Lisa Forte

318
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,680
um was a completely different experience

319
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,300
to my first

320
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,760
each Viewpoint was challenged in a

321
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,560
really constructive way

322
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,920
the subject was aligned to my expertise

323
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,680
but the panel was diverse it had a

324
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,980
balance of you know newcomers

325
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,540
mid-professionals

326
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,399
established professionals but all of us

327
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:30,540
had come from really different

328
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,240
backgrounds in terms of our experiences

329
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,100
in terms of you know where and how we

330
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,920
grew up and we all had cross-sector and

331
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,800
kind of cross-discipline experience

332
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,040
so we really need to nurture talent and

333
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,980
we need to be providing mentorship to

334
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,279
help build confidence in public speaking

335
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,019
you know some really really great

336
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:53,579
examples of this and I have to shout out

337
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:55,260
to the Beer farmers of course this is

338
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,000
where we are today

339
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,880
um but but but after you know other

340
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,680
movements out there including like black

341
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,100
hat and b-sides for example they're all

342
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,500
absolutely fantastic platforms for

343
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,420
newcomers because

344
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:13,620
you know they encourage new talents who

345
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,260
you know to submit at all and to share

346
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,720
their ideas and opinions but they don't

347
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,459
have to be right or wrong it's different

348
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:22,380
ways of thinking and I think we all need

349
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,120
to remember that

350
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,639
um but also what's great about them is

351
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,060
they provide mentorship as well if

352
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,519
that's required which you know is really

353
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,079
really important when you're doing your

354
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,540
early stages in in speaking or or

355
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,860
wanting to share any ideas

356
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:43,680
so how do we get out of our comfort

357
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,660
zones

358
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,600
okay here I am on the screen

359
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,920
so

360
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,579
um you'll see a couple of shots of some

361
00:13:52,579 --> 00:13:55,380
activities that I've done over this past

362
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:59,399
year and I I'm petrified of heights

363
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:02,700
there's me climbing a wall and I spend

364
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,680
so this was an hour session at a clip

365
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,300
and climb with my two children who

366
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,579
literally whiz up and down these bloody

367
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:10,500
walls

368
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,139
um and I spent 50 minutes climbing up

369
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:15,720
these walls and because I was so scared

370
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,300
to just trust

371
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,100
um trust the rope and allow it to kind

372
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,899
of catch me to come back down I

373
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:23,220
literally toddled all the way back down

374
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,720
up and down up and down my kids

375
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,339
absolutely peed themselves laughing they

376
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:28,380
thought it was hilarious

377
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,760
um and it was in the last 10 minutes

378
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,800
that I really pushed out my comfort zone

379
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,660
and said you know what trust the process

380
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,120
and just do it and I did and eventually

381
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,579
I was so proud of myself it was such a a

382
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:40,079
small win but it was something I was

383
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,579
super proud of

384
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:43,920
um this next picture so I took my family

385
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,459
and we um we climbed what I didn't

386
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:48,839
realize at the time one of the more

387
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:52,440
treacherous routes up Mount snowdum

388
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,060
um with two children in tow and actually

389
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,459
we just got just over halfway again

390
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:57,839
something I'm really really proud of

391
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,500
because often when you when you're

392
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,079
trying to push yourself beyond your

393
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,000
comfort levels

394
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,279
for me you know I also aim for

395
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:10,920
Perfection and I had you know with only

396
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,620
pet trainers and you just rugged gear

397
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,060
and things like that and I was like oh

398
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,800
anyone else that does this you know most

399
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,540
accidents happen up Snowden because you

400
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,980
don't have the correct foot gear and all

401
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,420
of this kind of stuff we only had a

402
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,519
bottle of water between myself my

403
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,800
husband and my two children so for me

404
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,899
that was a really really big win and

405
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:30,120
this was the second panel that I talked

406
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,760
about for me it's so easy when people

407
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,040
say oh do you want to come and join this

408
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,420
panel really like to hear your

409
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:40,199
perspective my my first reaction is

410
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:42,959
how can I get out of this

411
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,480
and yet here I am again but it is it's

412
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,760
just continuously pushing and pushing

413
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,279
and pushing past those boundaries

414
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,920
so as I say this is the very reason I'm

415
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,720
here today because I'm continuously

416
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,240
trying to push past those boundaries

417
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,040
so thinking about what we've got in our

418
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,399
industry we are so fortunate to have

419
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,260
thought leadership from some of the

420
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,260
finest professionals who are consistent

421
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:10,680
who are fantastic ambassadors and who

422
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,360
Inspire us and bring a wealth of

423
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,160
knowledge that I'm sure all of us in

424
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,300
this room have learned from

425
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:20,399
and it's very easy sort of you know

426
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,380
looking at your first speaking gigs or

427
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,300
to share your opinions in in whatever

428
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,660
capacity that may be

429
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:29,880
to Peg yourself or try and aspire to be

430
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,380
just like them you know I just had

431
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,540
flickering room in front of me

432
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,980
um and the first thing I thought is holy

433
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,480
hell how am I gonna you know how am I

434
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,160
gonna top that

435
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,320
um and that's a natural place to go is

436
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,000
when someone in front of you you know or

437
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,820
ahead of you or before you what have you

438
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:47,100
is you know but but but you want to

439
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,040
Aspire to eventually be like that and so

440
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,019
what we have to remember is that those

441
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:54,779
individuals all started somewhere

442
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:57,120
probably as nervous as I am on the stage

443
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,060
here today but you've got to remember

444
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,339
that a lot of work has gone into who

445
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:04,199
they are and what what what they have

446
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:06,780
achieved and where they are now

447
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,980
um you know a lot of Professional

448
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,380
Training a lot of research and

449
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,720
development work etc you know a lot of

450
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,980
self

451
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,380
preservation I suppose and and just

452
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,480
self-development to kind of get to where

453
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,160
you are so I think what we have to

454
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,199
remember is that we just cannot be or

455
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:24,720
will not be amazing immediately and

456
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,119
actually what is amazing it's it's how

457
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,480
you felt you delivered as an individual

458
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,120
um and and I know I'm not amazing

459
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,799
standing right here and I've got a long

460
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,440
way to go but I will continuously chip

461
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,780
away at that and work to where I want to

462
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,299
get towards and I think we have to set

463
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:45,179
really realistic expectations of you

464
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:46,740
know where we are today vest is where we

465
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,240
want to get to and I don't think there's

466
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,000
anything wrong with aspiring to be like

467
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,460
those professionals to have a polished

468
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:57,059
presentation or you know or a talk or a

469
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:59,700
webinar whatever that may be

470
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,740
um and I think it's important to say you

471
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,440
know that we don't we or we only measure

472
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,080
ourselves against ourselves how can we

473
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,480
keep getting better and better don't

474
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,760
compare ourselves to others

475
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,520
so in preparation of this talk I

476
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,220
actually spoke to Jessica Barker

477
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,400
um I spoke to Sarah Armstrong Smith and

478
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,740
I also spoke to Jake Moore

479
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,660
and I asked them to recall the first

480
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,760
time that they delivered a talk and what

481
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,260
it felt like for them

482
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,240
and these are people

483
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,039
even if you've heard of one of these

484
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:34,620
people you'll know that they do a lot of

485
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:37,919
circuits globally in the UK media

486
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,419
broadcast

487
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:42,000
Etc and

488
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,460
and so you know what what you're about

489
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,620
to hear in terms of their experiences is

490
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,480
is it just makes you realize that

491
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,460
they're just human beings

492
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,940
so suggested Jessica recalled that when

493
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,679
she first started speaking at sort of

494
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,840
hakere and cyber security conferences

495
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,820
around about eight years ago

496
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,280
she was super nervous and anxious to the

497
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,260
point that she'd spend months preparing

498
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,960
and in her words over preparing and

499
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,240
worrying terrified of kind of public

500
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,640
speaking and would actually wake up in

501
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,320
the night dreading a talk that could

502
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,419
still be months ahead I have to admit I

503
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:17,280
was the same when I first realized I've

504
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,799
got my toolk accepted

505
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:23,039
um but but she really wanted to get her

506
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,780
message about the human side of security

507
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,419
which is her specialist area out there

508
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:29,460
and so she just kept going

509
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,260
and that you know when when we think

510
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,220
about

511
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,020
the thoughts and ideas that we want to

512
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,760
share we don't have to be specific

513
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,340
professionals but we may just want to

514
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,559
share or air our opinions and it's about

515
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,480
finding that platform that supports that

516
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,220
for you

517
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:44,940
um

518
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,340
but she said you know the more she did

519
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,860
it the easier it slowly became

520
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,780
and she's you know the advice that she

521
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,340
offers is that you're if you're thinking

522
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,679
of speaking but feeling anxious about it

523
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,400
feel the fear do it anyway because you

524
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,620
will come off you know that panel that

525
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,960
stage whatever it may be feeling like

526
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,580
you've achieved something

527
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,100
focus on your message and think about

528
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,380
that talk as a conversation

529
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,660
so then I spoke to Jake Moore So

530
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,220
speaking to Jake

531
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,860
um on his first time public speaking was

532
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,960
actually really really similar in terms

533
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,720
of his emotions and you know the lead up

534
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,100
to that

535
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,080
um so he recalled his first presentation

536
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,600
he did was actually in a library

537
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,080
and only one person showed up I can't

538
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,419
imagine what that felt like for him and

539
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:36,240
I think he did go into a slight panic

540
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,160
but you know what he did he used that as

541
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,780
an opportunity to say you know what I'm

542
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,160
going to practice I'm just going to use

543
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,960
it as practice I mean I can't imagine

544
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,299
directing this this talk today just to

545
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:47,760
one person but you know he used that as

546
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,380
his practice and it and he encouraged

547
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,820
him to keep going

548
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:54,660
so he he said you know he still feels

549
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,580
very nervous right before speaking I

550
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,280
mean this guy's been on the BBC

551
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,100
um he's uh he's he's been on the BBC

552
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,340
News Etc um he's also been on the radio

553
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,200
you know there's been times that he

554
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,640
recalls where he's been given 10 minutes

555
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,679
notice to give a broadcast or what have

556
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:11,940
you

557
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,799
um and he's had to really research that

558
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:15,600
information but for him it's just made

559
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,160
him think on his feet rather than having

560
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,720
months ahead to procrastinate

561
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,340
overthinker

562
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,919
Etc so

563
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:25,020
um and then finally

564
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,000
um when I spoke to Sarah Armstrong Smith

565
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,600
so she told me that um when she first

566
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,600
started speaking which was about

567
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,640
2016. she just finished implementing a

568
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,840
large-scale

569
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,820
um love scale business continuity

570
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,940
program for organization and she was

571
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:45,480
invited to a conference in Tokyo to

572
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,460
share her experiences after winning an

573
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,360
internal competition

574
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,299
um

575
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:54,659
what she didn't know is what she didn't

576
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:55,740
know is that there was going to be over

577
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,539
a thousand people in attendance and she

578
00:21:57,539 --> 00:21:59,700
had 10 minutes to talk

579
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,820
um and they were super strict on time so

580
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,340
they had a bell for one minute to go and

581
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,919
a bell to sound the end and the end

582
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,140
means the end you literally have to

583
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,059
start whether you are

584
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:14,760
finished or not you had to stop

585
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,919
and her feelings at the time she was

586
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,780
petrified that she'd forget what she was

587
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,299
saying she was trying to memorize each

588
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:23,700
and every slide in every word thinking

589
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,460
that it had to be Pitch Perfect and she

590
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,320
was just you know simply worried that no

591
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,679
one would care or actually or that her

592
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,679
what she had to say was of any value to

593
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:36,659
this massive audience

594
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:39,659
and so the other point as well growing

595
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:41,400
bright red and feeling embarrassed is

596
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,539
nothing worse because you just feel like

597
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:43,620
you're going to tremble over your words

598
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,480
you've only got 10 minutes to slot at

599
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,360
you know a real valuable pitch or piece

600
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,059
of information to your audience

601
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:52,980
but all of these have now delivered

602
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,200
hundreds of talks and some of them

603
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,940
across the globe you know that's

604
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,820
Keynotes panel discussions round tables

605
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,080
Etc

606
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,419
so I think the final point that I want

607
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:06,059
to make is that we all have to start

608
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:07,380
somewhere

609
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,840
and as Jess Barker pointed out it

610
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,700
doesn't have to be perfect

611
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,159
each one can be like a practice for the

612
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,360
next time

613
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,280
so thank you so much all of you for

614
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,419
listening

615
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:20,159
um and coming along to this talk and if

616
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,419
you have any questions you will find me

617
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:22,940
at the bar drinking gin

618
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,430
thank you

619
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:31,519
[Applause]
