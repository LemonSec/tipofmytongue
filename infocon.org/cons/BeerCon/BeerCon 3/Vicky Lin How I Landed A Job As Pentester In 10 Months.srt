6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,000
how i landed a job as a pen tester in 10

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
months it's kind of like giving nick

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,160
cage gone in 60 seconds a run for his

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,039
money

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,039
um so vicky over to you over to you

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,720
hi everyone

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,840
thank you for being here

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,840
i'm very excited to give this talk

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,440
because this topic is so personal to me

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,760
and i hope by sharing my experience in

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,800
becoming a pen tester this can be

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,239
beneficial to you somehow

18
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,039
so

19
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,960
if you don't have any prior cyber

20
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,280
security experience and want to pivot to

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,879
pen testing

22
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,840
this talk is really for

23
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,800
you i started with knowing some basic

24
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,399
linux command

25
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,080
and a 2008 network plus certificate from

26
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,159
comptia

27
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,479
i didn't have any prior work experience

28
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,799
in cyber security

29
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,479
and so i decided

30
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,520
to get a reputable certificate

31
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,640
and get

32
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,560
concrete accomplishments as my trophy to

33
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,280
open the doors for me

34
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,920
i chose oscp because

35
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,799
it's a very hands-on certificate

36
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,360
and i want to learn the skills the way

37
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,200
it will be i will be using in the future

38
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,520
and oscp is pretty much

39
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,320
me trying to hack my way through

40
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,439
and five machines get enough points and

41
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,759
pass the exam

42
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,320
so typically people recommend

43
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,200
knowing linux networking

44
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,159
know how to recode and basic scripting

45
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,079
before start hacking

46
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,159
so even though i didn't know

47
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,439
all of them

48
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,040
i decided

49
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,520
to just start hacking and dive right in

50
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,280
there

51
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,598
i use two platforms

52
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,720
try hack me and hack the box

53
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,800
these platforms have

54
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,560
lab machines that

55
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,560
this that's designed for people to

56
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,800
practice hacking

57
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,120
and they're really great because they

58
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,040
are gamified

59
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,560
it's interesting

60
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,680
to hack there and the more i play

61
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,440
the higher the ranking

62
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,920
the more points i get and these are the

63
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,839
things i plan to put on my cv

64
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,840
on average

65
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,080
i practice four to six hours every day

66
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,400
while six days

67
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,480
a week

68
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,640
about three months into

69
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,160
my plan

70
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,879
i met my mentor maria through women in

71
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,120
cyber security

72
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,239
she is

73
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,040
already a cyber security professional

74
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,440
and through talking with her i learned a

75
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,120
lot on how

76
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,280
it is like working in the

77
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,000
in the field

78
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,720
she knew some people were organizing

79
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,280
cyber security conference and encouraged

80
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,640
me to do a lightning talk

81
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,400
around three months i really didn't know

82
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,599
much

83
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,560
but

84
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,840
i remember an exercise i did

85
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,200
using just a simple script to extract

86
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,599
password from firefox

87
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,480
and it was very interesting for me

88
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,159
so i decided to turn it into a talk

89
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,440
i submitted

90
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,040
and abstract to the organizers

91
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,440
then i got busy in preparing for my

92
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,720
upcoming oscp exam

93
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,480
before the exam

94
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,080
i've studied

95
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,760
around seven months

96
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,159
i've gone through all the all the course

97
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,560
materials and exercises

98
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,560
and rooted about 15 machines

99
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,480
on the exam day i prepared a whole table

100
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,400
of food and drinks to get me through the

101
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,480
next 24 hours

102
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,200
the exam is 24 hours

103
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,000
the very first machine i tackled is a

104
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,160
buffer overflow machine

105
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,798
this is a technique i've practiced many

106
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:21,759
times

107
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,240
so my plan was to knock it out of the

108
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,560
way as soon as possible and then move on

109
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,639
but i couldn't

110
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,000
two hours into the exam i was still

111
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,600
struggling on that freaking machine

112
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,400
so after nine hours i finally solved the

113
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,720
machine and it turns out to be the only

114
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,199
machine i've solved

115
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,240
i felt the exam

116
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,639
on the other hand i got some good news

117
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,280
that my talk was accepted

118
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,080
so i prepared the best i could and did

119
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,479
the talk it was a wonderful experience

120
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,639
around a month

121
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,600
at

122
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,560
oscp was taking way too long

123
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,639
than i expected

124
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,160
so i decided to take whatever i have

125
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,960
and

126
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,638
just start applying for jobs

127
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,800
probably because of my taiwanese route

128
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,800
i always want to get the most bang out

129
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,199
of my book

130
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,240
my inner guru told me to not cheap out

131
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,160
this time and i'm glad i listened

132
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,360
i've asked

133
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,600
three cyber security professionals to

134
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,440
give me feedback

135
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,039
on my cv

136
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,280
and they really helped me

137
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,840
present my accomplishment the best i

138
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,800
could

139
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,440
on cv

140
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,320
and i also paid for premium membership

141
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,840
on linkedin and zing just so that

142
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,120
i can

143
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,520
compare my profile to other candidates

144
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,880
and i can also know which companies

145
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,280
or head hunters have been checking out

146
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,280
my profile

147
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,400
and also just to show that i'm serious

148
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,520
about finding a job

149
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,880
i have a spreadsheet that keeps track of

150
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,120
the companies with the pentester rules

151
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,440
that i have applied

152
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,280
and the day that i get their first

153
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,919
response the day of this

154
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,240
of the first interview second interview

155
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,160
etc

156
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,919
and every day i will apply for pentester

157
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,280
rose

158
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,960
and i will

159
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,000
add more companies as i apply

160
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,319
and cross our companies as i get a

161
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,880
rejection

162
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,840
about 1 out of 10 applications i sent

163
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,360
now i would get a response back

164
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,599
i also network with

165
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,120
headhunters

166
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,280
what's really nice about working with

167
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,120
headhunters is

168
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,520
they are typically knowledgeable about

169
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,680
the current job market

170
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,000
and they are open to talk about

171
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,199
salary expectations and the realistic

172
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,400
expectations from the companies

173
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,560
and through which it really helped me

174
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,720
position myself in the market

175
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,039
one day i got an email

176
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,120
hi vicky

177
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,919
your cv looks very interesting and we

178
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,759
would like to have an interview with you

179
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,680
i went to the interview and the rest was

180
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,440
history

181
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,319
i'm three months into my new pen testing

182
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,280
role

183
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,840
and it is really the job i have been

184
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,840
looking

185
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,840
for i get to hack all day

186
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,560
i get to share my passion with people

187
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,879
and i get to do it anywhere i want

188
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,280
some of you might be wondering hey so

189
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,039
you got a job

190
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,759
without having a certificate

191
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,960
no i i have a network plus certificate

192
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,560
from 2008

193
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,360
even though it probably didn't help much

194
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,800
because it was so old

195
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,280
not having oscp

196
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,960
definitely cut out some of my chances

197
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,199
through a headhunter i know that some of

198
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,560
his clients

199
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,400
wouldn't even consider

200
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,520
candidates who don't have oscp or the

201
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,960
equivalent certificates

202
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,719
i will probably get more chances

203
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,839
if i i'm certified

204
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,399
but now looking back

205
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,560
i would like to say in confidence that

206
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,440
don't let not having certificates stop

207
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,080
you from applying for jobs

208
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,800
if you have done enough studying and

209
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,839
have something to show

210
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,080
and

211
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,320
so

212
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,200
to to summarize a little bit

213
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,040
how to

214
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,440
land a job as a pen tester

215
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,560
first

216
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,360
have a plan

217
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,720
whether it's more or less than 10 months

218
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,240
have something that work with your

219
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,640
schedule

220
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,600
if you can spend two hours a day

221
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,120
to study

222
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,640
then do that and do that consistently

223
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,279
once you've decided on your plan

224
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,839
stick to it from the beginning to the

225
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,680
end

226
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,959
second

227
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,040
collect trophies to open the door for

228
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,640
you

229
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,240
we've talked about certificates

230
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,720
you can also use things like

231
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,240
the number of boxes you've rooted the

232
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,399
global ranking or

233
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,560
the hacker pro hacker

234
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,440
status that you have on these online

235
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,880
practicing platforms

236
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,120
if you play ctfs

237
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,040
it's the same thing you can also talk

238
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,120
about it on your cv

239
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,760
i've had an interviewer who go into

240
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,200
detail about the ctfs i've played and

241
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,800
the challenges i've solved

242
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,160
i have a talk under my belt

243
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,399
you don't have to know the organizers to

244
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,480
do a talk

245
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,560
there are so many cyber security

246
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,720
conferences happening

247
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,440
globally every month

248
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,160
and many of them will be happy to give

249
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,240
new speakers a chance

250
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,040
now look at beacon

251
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,920
and let me tell you a secret

252
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,480
you don't have to do the best talk of

253
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,519
the world

254
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,040
to put it on your cv

255
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,040
so definitely find something that fits

256
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,279
you

257
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,040
you can if you know how to code that's

258
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,720
brilliant

259
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,120
do a coding project that has to do with

260
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,640
pen testing

261
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,279
even if you don't have any ideas now as

262
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,640
you study

263
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,000
ideas will come up and when it does you

264
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,800
know what to do

265
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,240
you can also write a technical blog

266
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,399
a senior pen tester

267
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,920
rana khalil

268
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,440
publishes

269
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,720
write ups

270
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,839
as she

271
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,040
hacked

272
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,200
as she was preparing for her oscp

273
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,000
and

274
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,959
i asked her how has this helped her in

275
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,399
her career

276
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,440
and she wrote back to me

277
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,079
it definitely helped in many ways in my

278
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,360
career

279
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,240
first it got me noticed

280
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,399
i've received many messages from

281
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,200
recruiters informing me that someone

282
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,120
technical on their team read my

283
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,399
write-ups

284
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,480
and asked them to reach out to me for a

285
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,519
position

286
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,399
that opened up on their team

287
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,120
in one scenario i've even had someone

288
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,360
wave the technical interview because

289
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,519
i've already showcased

290
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,519
that i know what i'm talking about

291
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,440
through my write-ups

292
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,079
second it advanced my knowledge in the

293
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,839
subject matter

294
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,079
since i had to explain to the general

295
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,880
audience through video or blog

296
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,240
i had to really properly understand it

297
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,120
to do that i spent countless hours

298
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,120
reading and researching about every

299
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,399
single thing

300
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,200
that i include in my content

301
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,440
so it really solidified my knowledge

302
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,320
and lastly you can also do a fun hacking

303
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,680
project

304
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,720
and this is an area where you can really

305
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,560
show your creativity and passion

306
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,560
just through a quick google i found

307
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,399
something called arduino tv annoyer

308
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,519
pretty much

309
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,240
you make your own tv remote control and

310
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,800
you can go around and turn on people's

311
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,320
tv and off

312
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,120
and to annoy them

313
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,680
so keep it light and fun a little bit

314
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,320
mischievous is totally okay and

315
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,639
definitely stay within the legal

316
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,200
boundary

317
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,360
so third

318
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,800
get a mentor or a coach as early as

319
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,040
possible

320
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,240
do you know why world class athletes

321
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,120
have coaches

322
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,240
it's not because the athletes are not

323
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,519
great

324
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,760
it's because a good coach

325
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,639
can take a great athlete even further

326
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,360
even this is a service that you have to

327
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,279
pay now

328
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,079
trust me it will pay for yourself

329
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,240
once you once you lend the job you

330
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,800
wanted

331
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,920
so that concludes my journey and my tips

332
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,360
i would like to give a big thank you

333
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,560
for

334
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,279
my mentor maria and everyone who has

335
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,279
helped me

336
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,519
in becoming a pen tester

337
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,560
without them it is really

338
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,279
not possible

339
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,440
and i would like to give a big thank you

340
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,639
for the beer farmers at beer cotton

341
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,160
and i hope to see you again

342
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,160
you're very welcome

343
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,040
um

344
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,959
first of all congratulations

345
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,440
it's a fantastic story a journey

346
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,560
