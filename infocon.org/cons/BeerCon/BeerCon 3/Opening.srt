done back on one burka one was about

36
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,000
people that a lot of people already knew

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,679
and heard of in the industry and a

38
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,480
couple of people that not so well known

39
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,040
viacom 2 was all about the rookies rise

40
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,200
of the rookie we called it was about

41
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,360
people not necessarily fresh into the

42
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,959
industry but certainly fresh to public

43
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,440
speak and um that was about giving those

44
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,840
people an opportunity to shine

45
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,599
we think it was really successful really

46
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,720
proud of it

47
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,080
and this time around we've got a bit of

48
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,120
a blend so it's a few people you know um

49
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,640
quite well known

50
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,280
few people not so well known and a few

51
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,840
rookies that never done it before at all

52
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,920
so it's a nice blend we hope that you

53
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,680

really excited about that

75
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,400
so before we start with the the main

76
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,440
event

77
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,519
we need to do some housekeeping we don't

78
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,280
need to do any fire drill stuff because

79
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,720
you're all in your own environments we

80
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,400
know where to run

81
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,720
yeah which is there just right if the

82
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,680
fire isn't there if the fire is there

83
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,159
then we run there although

84
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,599
there is some safety advice i'd like to

85
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,040
give out though your smoke alarm you

86
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,360
need to test your smoke alarm change the

87
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,200
battery if it's beeping

88
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,599
trust me it saves a lot of pain that's

89
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,480
good

90
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,239
yeah it's really good advice

91
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,120
so

92
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,680
the ticket scheme this time around we we

93
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,080
ran a free ticket here and

94
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,920
the reason that we had tickets at all

95
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,239
was to for two reasons one is to

96
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,480
get registration of interest in swag

97
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,480
merchandise and all that kind of stuff

98
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,640
after the event like we usually do we'll

99
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,880
be producing goodies i'll be sending

100
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,720

101
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,000
select a bunch of people that have

102
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,680
bought a ticket or at least acquired a

103
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,880
ticket

104
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,880
some of you paid money for tickets which

105
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,479
we're really really grateful for because

106
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,800
that helps us fund the the merchandise

107
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,960
that we're able to supply people

108
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,680
and um someone paid a few more quid than

109
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,639
we asked for tickets so test people gave

110
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,720

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,080

191
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,039
in the post

192
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,800
in pieces i'm sorry is that too soon

193
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,160
it's too soon

194
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,840
and then the last one really was it's

195
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,240
more of a partnership than a sponsorship

196
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,560
um and this is robert walters who are

197
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,800
fairly global

198
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,560
you are global or you want a binary

199
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,919
situation isn't it

200
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,759
um but they are a global recruitment

201
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,919
organization and we figure a lot of what

202
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,120
we're all about

203
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,240
in terms of the industries is

204
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,360
opportunity

205
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,759
and it's providing the platforms and the

206
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,319
ways forward for people to get that next

207
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,680
leg in their career get that next

208
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,080
chapter going on in their career but

209
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,599
when robert walters came to us and said

210
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,280
hey we like what you guys are doing we'd

211
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,720
like to work with you

212
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,479
a we were kind of shocked

213
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,599
uh but b we were really excited about it

214
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,440
so robert walters are

215
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,080
our partner

216
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,840
that's not just them giving us some

217
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,960
money

218
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,120
um that is them having a presence with

219
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,960
the conference so if you joined our

220
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,120
discord and if you haven't yet done that

221
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,599
um we'd urge you to go away and do it

222
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,399
beer con dot tv slash discord

223
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,120
we try and keep our urls quite simple

224
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,519
um and if you go in there you will find

225
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,360
there is a bunch of channels that are

226
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,799
around careers

227
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,479
and robert walters have got people in

228
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,480
the discord from their their crew that

229
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,760
are going to

230
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,920
offer careers advice on a one-to-one or

231
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,399
on a little group basis so get along and

232
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,800
ask them some questions we've had many

233
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,160
conversations with them they're very

234
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,480
much in the same mindset that we are

235
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,360
really pleased to be working with them

236
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,760
um and then one more shout out and then

237
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,519
i'll hand to the other guys for any any

238
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,040
follow-ups before we start the actual

239
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,880
conference so we want to talk about the

240
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,680
crew so there are two people here with

241
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,920
us that are busy wandering up and down

242
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,760
pressing buttons without their hair on

243
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,440
fire which is great

244
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,680
we put the fire out about 10 minutes

245
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,279
yeah about that

246
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,800
keep doing it though that's that's the

247
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,880
problem and that's dave and jared yeah

248
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,240
and um they're both quorum guys

249
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,800
foreign farmers link up three people

250
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,440

251
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,839
got lennox

252
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,600
we've also got nikos who's doing a lot

253
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,200

254
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,160
days

255
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,160
when it's both leno and nikos are going

256
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,240
to be doing the the green room stuff

257
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,480
that's bringing the guest speakers in

258
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,600
they're having a chat with them and then

259
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,800
delivering them into the into the

260
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,839
production

261
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,200
environment

262
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,560
um

263
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,120
so that's great and we thank them very

264
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,399
much for that they'll also be doing a

265
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,399
little bit of buttering around in our

266
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,399
social media just catching anything that

267
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,760
we might miss

268
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,600
and then finally from me i want to just

269
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,279
give a shout out to the mentors so this

270
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,120
worked really really well for last year

271
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,839
with the rookies

272
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,480
it meant that when we actually produced

273
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,640
the event you would never have thought

274
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,519
the speakers have never done it before

275
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,760
they look very capable very confident

276
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,079
very produced very polished

277
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,079
and that is down to them but it's also

278
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,560
in a large part down to the mentoring

279
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,000
so i'm just going to shout out to claire

280
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,800
till's zoe rose sam humphreys again dave

281

mckenzie

282
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,279
seems to have

283
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,800
more roles in this conference and last

284
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,320
conference than any of us

285

289
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,320
follow up with any remarks before we get

290
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,800
niko i i think we should go to nicos

291
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,240
because we're still running a little bit

292
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,959
behind time so let's uh let's bring them

293
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,640
in and see uh

294
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,640
what kind of what levels of explosions

295
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,199
we have
