00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,399
good morning welcome back to everybody

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,240
um and it's our great pleasure to

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,399
welcome troy hunt to the rooms good

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,800
morning good day guys good good evening

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,599
it looks quite dark where you are yeah

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,960
that's probably a fact

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,320
i was literally just talking about this

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,840
this is my new wallpaper it's on the

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,920
wall there and i've got to get rid of

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,720
all the

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,640
light stuff but yeah yeah it's going to

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,880
be really cool

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,359
fantastic so

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,119
there's no format particularly to this

15
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,280
chat troy has not got a presentation to

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,920
deliver um he does enough of that quite

17
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,960
frankly

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,719
so what we thought we'd do is we'd go

19
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,719
back quite a long time troy in fact you

20
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,640
and i go back even longer and i know

21
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,480
john you've known troy for a long time

22
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,440
as well

23
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,079
um but we thought it'd be really cool

24
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,239
fun to just have a chat

25
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,520
because we've done a lot of work with

26
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,399
troy over the last few years definitely

27
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,480
he's seen us grow up he has seen us grow

28
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,959
up from

29
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,879
[Laughter]

30
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,079
um

31
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,400
but we last met up

32
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,080
in real life

33
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,680
at b-sides london in in 2019 and you

34
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,760
came along and joined us for a

35
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,000
presentation that we gave down there and

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,920
that feels like a [ __ ] long time ago

37
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,080
now right yes i mean in everyone's life

38
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,840
how much has happened since funnily

39
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,080
enough like i i was there for infosec eu

40
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,000
and i got an invite today to go back to

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,479
infosecu and i'm like do you know we're

42
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:27,680
not even allowed to leave the country

43
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,520
it's like i have no chance of getting

44
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,240
here

45
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,720
that's how different it is now

46
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,880
yeah at least you've got such a big

47
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,119
country you are allowed to travel inside

48
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,799
it has multiple time zones it has

49
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,240
multiple times and it has time and a

50
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,159
half times yeah that's right does it

51
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,000
count and you know we're like we've been

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,920
so many awesome places as a result of

53
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,119
not being able to go anywhere else so

54
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,720
like we would have normally been i don't

55
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,920
know like another country somewhere and

56
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,119
now we've been

57
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,960
like in the middle of the desert and

58
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,920
then like chasing crocodile okay being

59
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,000
chased by crocodiles you know like in

60
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,479
really interesting places and um

61
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,000
we have actually just seen all this

62
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,840
super cool stuff that in all my life in

63
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,759
australia i've never seen so yeah

64
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:06,840
thank

65
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,679
you and it's amazing even in a country

66
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,680
as tiny as the uk we have a similar

67
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,760
concept where everything is not actually

68
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,520
on your own doorstep in

69
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,760
in australia in terms the doorstep is

70
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,720
big

71
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,640
but yeah there are places within the

72
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,239
country that you just never got to well

73
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:23,840
i mean i had a year in the uk i saw

74
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,800
everything then but you know um

75
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,160
you need a lot more time here to

76
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,480
actually see much

77
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,200
you do you do so

78
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,120
we did b-size london we had a really

79
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,840
good time uh you won the golden cowbell

80
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,680
award which i'm hoping that you still

81
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,519
have that parallel kicking

82
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,239
this is not a prop right there

83
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,360
oh this is not staged

84
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,920
so for people that are not aware of this

85
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,160
i don't remember it we we ran a kind of

86
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,160
mocked up award ceremony at the very end

87
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,640
of our talk at b-size london and it was

88
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,879
basically a piss take of all of the i'll

89
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,518
get to the point

90
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,680
and you put those on you you applied

91
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,879
those stickers

92
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,840
um it was a bit of a piss take ceremony

93
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,280
and it was predominantly about all of

94
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,959
the idiots in infosec but we did have

95
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,519
some honest awards at the end well the

96
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,319
fact that we weren't nominated and also

97
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,480
the judges for our own award i think is

98
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,959
really one of the points to make our

99
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,720
awards were actually and we didn't

100
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,319
actually charge anyone for winning

101
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,360
either

102
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,440
you know so i i think i think there's

103
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,200
something to be said for beer farmer

104
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,959
integrity when it comes to awards i

105
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,239
think i would have asked for a refund if

106
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,840
i had to pay another guy with a cowbell

107
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,360
but it was for the exposure

108
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,879
you know how much i can feed my kids on

109
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,500
exposure

110
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,280
[Laughter]

111
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,560
and we then we did the first beer con

112
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,040
yeah and you were a part of that yeah

113
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,560
and so

114
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,239
the story behind that which took us

115
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,840
about three hours to discuss last night

116
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,840
but we haven't got three hours today

117
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,599
was um

118
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,439
it was my original idea was we'd had a

119
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,159
really good 2019 we've done all the all

120
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,040
the uk conferences and then i said to

121
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,799
the guys look why don't we have like an

122
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,959
hour podcast

123
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,880
what we'll do is we'll recap on the year

124
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,560
and talk about the high points and i

125
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,880
said well i could probably get troy to

126
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,639
come along and be a part of that and

127
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,639
we'll just have an hour and it'll be

128
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,639
brilliant and then ian

129
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,479
i think aim was a little offended i was

130
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,240
i was offended i was deeply offended he

131
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,160
was offended by how good the idea was

132
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,560
yeah i think and then you went off and

133
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,919
roll the decks the [ __ ] out of the

134
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,680
internet when i'll get dave kennedy

135
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,800
yeah i'll get i'll get jake home freezer

136
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,440
you name it and we ended up with a 26

137
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,199
and a half hour

138
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,280
thing that we did

139
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,919
which you were very much a part of um

140
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,680
and so we've always enjoyed working with

141
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,479
you and i'm gonna get to the point now

142
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,800
i was hoping yeah i know sometimes it

143
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,080
takes me a while

144
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,199
that's what happens when you become a

145
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,260
manager um

146
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,240
[Music]

147
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,479
talk us through some of the highlights

148
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,320
and even some low lights it's entirely

149
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,360
up to you two years now it's been a long

150
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,440
time so what's been going on in in troy

151
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,720
land

152
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,560
how long did we leave for this let's

153
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,720
just

154
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,840
remember when you're talking about the

155
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,840
one two years ago uh remember i was on a

156
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,600
boat and i was like out there we're on

157
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,280
this catamaran and we're just like out

158
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,639
in the middle of the harbour sailing

159
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,840
around

160
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,240
in the uh in the beautiful aussie aussie

161
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,120

162
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,800
uh well i've spent a lot more time in

163
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,240
the beautiful aussie sun because i have

164
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,440
not been able to go anywhere since

165
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,680
february last year so

overseas don't quite get this but like

168
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,240
we

169
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,400
we're like a massive island in the

170
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,160
middle of nowhere that already had like

171
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,560
really strict quarantine rules so if

172
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,759
anyone's ever flown into australia

173
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,120
before you'll see all these signs it's

174
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,720
like don't bring in a banana we'll send

175
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,160
you to jail kind of thing like it's

176
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,080
really really strict

177
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,000
so when when code hit they're saying hey

178
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,199
you're like we're used to keeping bugs

179
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,280
and [ __ ] out so you know that's a start

180
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,880
so everything just got super super

181
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,800
locked down and i came back in uh early

182
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,880
feb last year

183
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,240
and i was like oh you know we'll come

184
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,199
back for a while then we'll be able to

185
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,680
see yeah or whatever no i haven't been

186
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,600
able to go anywhere since

187
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,800
so in 2019 i traveled

188
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,960
243 days and in

189
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,600
2019 uh 2020 at least after

190
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,600
getting back to australia zero days

191
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,639
overseas uh 2021 where were we at here

192
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,840
24 hours zero days overseas as well so i

193
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,560
think the closest we can hope for to go

194
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,160
overseas at all

195
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,280
is gonna be the second half of next year

196
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,319
which

197
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,000
which we hope is going to be good

198
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,800
because actually that's one of the

199
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,800
things i haven't got engaged so one of

200
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,240
the things we want to actually do is

201
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,599
after our aussie wedding in september

202
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,440
next year go to norway and and do

203
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,199
something equivalent there

204
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,199
uh congratulations

205
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,680
yeah from all of us thanks guys

206
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,080
many many good things happen so in fact

207
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,520
this has been fun because for charlotte

208
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,199
like australia she's been here plenty of

209
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,080
times before but hasn't seen like

210
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,599
you know crocodiles and stuff like that

211
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,000
so i'll go see cryptos

212
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,240
so we've gone like multiple trips not

213
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,840
not a native species to the uk

214
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,759
or norway

215
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:20,880
it's like what do you got over there

216
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,319
that's dangerous she's like i don't know

217
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,120
like

218
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,599
moose so that sounds really scary

219
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,360
look at this little beauty

220
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,919
this is totally different in australia

221
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,520
everything's dangerous and also in

222
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,120
australia the smaller they are the more

223
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,280
dangerous they are exactly i found a

224
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,479
mosquito

225
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,080
on our wall yesterday it looked like it

226
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,120
could have carried away one of my

227
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,080
children like it was just ridiculous

228
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,360
it's huge

229
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,879
so no we've just been i know this has

230
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:45,360
got nothing to do with the

231
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,240
infrastructure but we've just been

232
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,840
seeing like heaps and heaps of australia

233
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,759
and it's actually been super cool

234
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,199
because we've gone all of these places

235
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,199
we couldn't have gone before and now

236
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,199
we're sort of looking at um particularly

237
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,400
for january and it's like where do we

238
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,400
want to go well i can

239
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,319
kind of go anywhere in australia and and

240
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,400
that's it but yeah it's just super

241
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,080
awesome places here so

242
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,199
we've been doing a lot of that and then

243
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,639
of course it's like for everyone right

244
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,080
like just about everything has gone

245
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,280
online

246
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,639
so it's actually been really good for me

247
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,479
in terms of events because

248
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,720
i've been to probably more events in

249
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,319
2021

250
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,919
than what i would have ever been to

251
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,319
before because going to an event is i go

252
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,280
here

253
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,360
i'm at the beer con event and then it's

254
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,680
like i'll shut that down and then i'll

255
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,360
follow another zoom link and i'll add

256
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,440
another event so

257
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,720
so it's actually been really good for

258
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,840
that

259
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,240
but i just just haven't i was thinking

260
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,200
you know i was gonna say i haven't had

261
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,640
social interaction but it's not quite

262
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,799
true because what we've done is instead

263
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,240
of going like around the world and

264
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,760
seeing places we've actually realized

265
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,599
that we have nice neighbors

266
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,120
so we've got

267
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,200
we've got all of these nice uh nice

268
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,880
friends now that are really close to us

269
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,160
so they're literally one of my neighbors

270
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,240
calling me now he's gonna buy a boat um

271
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,600
so we just went like looking at boats

272
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,880
today and he lives over the canal and

273
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,000
then we'll go wakeboarding or something

274
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,839
one day and it's like this is what life

275
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,760
has become it's actually become a really

276
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,600
sort of fulfilling

277
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,480
alternative to what it was before

278
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,040
because it is so much fun to stand in

279
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,519
line at immigration at heathrow during

280
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,200
the summer where somebody's trying to

281
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,360
enter the country with an email

282
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,920
that they printed you know because

283
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,480
hey troy so are you up for an infosec

284
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,160
question yeah do it why not okay so so

285
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,000
from your perspective and all of the

286
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,760
conferences that you've attended and all

287
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,320
of that kind of thing um do you believe

288
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,200
that the covid pandemic has led to you

289
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,000
know

290
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,519
um a crazy amount of um

291
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,640
you know cyber crime and that we need a

292
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,279
new fifth generation ai driven machine

293
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,480
learning post-quantum solution

294
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,839
i think we're gonna solve it with the

295
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,000
metaverse as my theory

296
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,399
it's going to fix everything oh yeah

297
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,000
we went there

298
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,320
he went there

299
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,399
too soon i i

300
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,800
i think it's interesting that

301
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,800
that things haven't just completely gone

302
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,079
to [ __ ] when i think a lot of

303
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:05,680
speculation would have been that now

304
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,440
having said that like i had a i had a

305
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,320
chat with one of the companies that

306
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,760
we've been working with this morning and

307
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,600
they work in a ransomware space and they

308
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
they were sort of saying look it's just

309
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,200
gone so

310
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,440
massive since covert that their space

311
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,880
not just because ransomware's like

312
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,720
ticked up and now you got like literally

313
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,279
biden talking about ransomware but uh

314
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,320
they were doing a lot of products that

315
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,920
work with things like remote vpn

316
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,440
solutions and they sort of said look you

317
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,360
know we've had big customers call up and

318
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,959
go hey we need to like

319
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,399
10x or 100x our remote vpn workforce

320
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,000
like just about overnight can you please

321
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,959
help us

322
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:37,920
so i think there's been a lot of

323
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,519
opportunity for organizations like that

324
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,040
but i don't think we've seen like the

325
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,920
mass carnage which some people kind of

326
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,680
uh predicted in the same way that we

327
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,279
haven't seen like the mass financial

328
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,440
ruin that some people predicted

329
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,800
uh like there's

330
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,640
there's been stuff i mean don't get me

331
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,240
wrong like zoom bombing was fun right

332
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,480
like we all enjoyed watching a bunch of

333
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,279
that

334
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,680
but i don't think we were victims of

335
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,560
that ourselves yeah there you go

336
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,160
okay that's entertaining

337
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,640
but um i just don't feel that it's been

338
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,519
like the the the mass hysteria that some

339
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,160
people thought it might be

340
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,399
do you think that could also be

341
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,160
and this is probably getting a bit of

342
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,360
the tinfoil hat on maybe um

343
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,120
organizations that have been a bit

344
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,440
reluctant to have people working from

345
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,360
home and wanting to have people in the

346
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,200
office instead

347
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,880
well it's kind of funny isn't it like i

348
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,560
remember

349
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,760
my

350
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,320
very long long years at pfizer

351
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,040
and how much time we spent

352
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,800
trying to say hey i can actually work

353
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,079
well from home

354
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,839
and i just remember my that the boss i

355
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,680
had for most time there he'd be like

356
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,160
you need to be visible you know people

357
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,640
need to know that you are there actually

358
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,399
in the office because then they know

359
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,639
that you're working so well

360
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,839
what if i'm in the office and not

361
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,839
working

362
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,720
and i think what's really interesting

363
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,959
now is that organizations like that it's

364
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,959
like okay you don't have a choice so

365
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,320
either you get people to work from home

366
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,680
or they just don't work at all and then

367
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,800
you can figure out how to run your

368
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,880
business with no workers

369
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,440
uh so if hands were sort of forced

370
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,600
it'll be really interesting to see i i

371
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,360
don't think that the term like back to

372
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,880
normal is the right term but it would be

373
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,920
really interesting to see once we're

374
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,079
back to a more stable state

375
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,399
how different it is you know when when

376
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,639
there is the option to be able to return

377
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,160
to work everyone's had to get work from

378
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,279
home like how much more will be remote

379
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,480
and i think there's kind of two sides

380
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,440
though right there'll be a bunch of

381
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,839
organizations that are like uh okay we

382
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,320
demonstrated this and it works or it

383
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,160
worked well enough that maybe instead of

384
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,760
like five days a week in the office yeah

385
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,880
yeah two days i don't know something

386
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,959
like that but then i also wonder on the

387
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,240
individual side there'll be a bunch of

388
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,360
people like look there's enough

389
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,160
organizations that have now put in place

390
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,519
the mechanisms to make this work and

391
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,920
have proven that it can work that

392
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,160
i've actually got some choices you know

393
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,839
my choices mean maybe i want to go and

394
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,120
spend some time with someone who doesn't

395
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,560
want me sitting in traffic in you know

396
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,040
an hour or two a day

397
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,000
yeah there's another advantage as well

398
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,079
if if you want to if you have the option

399
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,120
to work full-time at home yeah the world

400
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,560
is your the sky is the limit now

401
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,320
versus in belgium a lot of companies

402
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,120
again ask people to come to the office

403
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,320
so it's really strange what did we learn

404
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,920
yeah maybe they learned the hard way

405
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,560
when the good employees go to other

406
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,399
companies i don't know

407
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,440
yeah but it's a i mean yes sorry troy

408
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,760
it's absolutely true in my own case so

409
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,200
during cobrad

410
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,399
i i

411
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,320
had it i say i

412
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,399
my partner and i had another kid

413
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,079
so we've now got an eight month old

414
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,839
yeah kick the tires and light the fires

415
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,600
buddy um

416
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,360
but yeah we had another kid

417
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,120
and

418
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,959
working from home

419
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,079
that life

420
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,240
it became an adaptation of what it ever

421
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,680
used to look like

422
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,680
so you started to build your

423
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,600
your home life around the fact that you

424
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,279
worked at home

425
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,839
and now the option exists to go back

426
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,519
into the office you're looking at it and

427
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,399
thinking

428
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,440
well

429
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,480
actually life's changed it's changed

430
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,000
profoundly from what it used to look

431
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,399
like 18 months two years ago and working

432
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,480
from home is now actually better and

433
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,600
then you think well hang in a minute you

434
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,839
know i'm paid to do a job

435
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:26,560
but

436
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,120
i feel like i've become more

437
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,600
effective in my role by working from

438
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,880
home and my senior team at zen

439
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,959
it's similar and we're actually put our

440
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,560
output it seems to weirdly have

441
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,800
increased over that period of time

442
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,880
so the home life is now work is part of

443
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,880
the home life but with that separation

444
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,320
so that's just my own personal

445
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,480
experience i think john's point about

446
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,839
just sort of opening up other

447
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,680
opportunities in other places i find

448
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,279
this really fascinating it's almost like

449
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,519
a great leveler right it's like imagine

450
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,279
if it doesn't matter where you are you

451
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,279
know and you can do anything i mean

452
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,560
certainly for me like i was saying

453
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,920
before i've been able to do a lot more

454
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,199
events but

455
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,800
because there's so much more demand like

456
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,040
i've literally been able to put my fees

457
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,199
up a lot for events and i i

458
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,680
the way i can try and control fees or

459
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,000
try and control how busy i am is i just

460
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,519
keep raising the price until more people

461
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,720
say no

462
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,920
and you know what happened

463
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,440
i didn't say no

464
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,279
just keep going and going

465
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,720
and it's you know this is a really

466
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,079
interesting thing and i think we all

467
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,680
sort of get to benefit from this because

468
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,760
you get to kind of shop yourself around

469
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,360
the world to some extent where it's like

470
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,639
well

471
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,160
you know so long as you don't have to go

472
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,759
into the office you could be working

473
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,880
from anywhere yeah for anyone um and i

474
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,320
think we're sort of overcoming things

475
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,680
like time zones and this sort of thing

476
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,360
as well and recognizing that people work

477
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,560
different hours even if you're in the

478
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,000
same time zone

479
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,120
so i i i struggle to find downsides for

480
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,279
people in our industry now having said

481
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,480
that i think there's people in a lot of

482
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,839
other industries you know like if you're

483
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,519
in hospitality here it's just been an

484
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,440
absolute nightmare and that that sucks

485
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,920
it's like you can't zoom in for a pizza

486
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,759
right like you you have to come into the

487
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,199
restaurant or else you just don't get to

488
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,360
make money

489
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,560
it's interesting because there's a

490
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,639
little thing that popped up on the chat

491
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:07,920
and thank you very much for

492
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,040
participating in part of the

493
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,279
conversation about so then it's boat

494
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,000
buying time right and this is this is

495
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,160
interesting to me because i look at it

496
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,759
as it's become an ungovernable

497
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:22,800
ungovernable and untaxable situation

498
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,519
and it's sort of like the uh any the

499
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,600
inane situation where we have you know

500
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,279
various nation states that are trying to

501
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,000
manage the internet right and and hold

502
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,320
people accountable for their conduct but

503
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,360
again you know if you work remotely for

504
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,519
an american company but you're based in

505
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,480
spain you know where do you pay taxes

506
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,160
how does the government collect its

507
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,959
money um you know how does the how do

508
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,959
you know where how do you get to vote

509
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,040
like there's all of these

510
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,759
things about being like you know being

511
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,839
able to remote work and being able to be

512
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,480
anywhere in the world but the realities

513
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,720
are is that the government is struggling

514
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,600
with it and a great example is the um

515
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,919
the research and development tax credit

516
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,119
that you get

517
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,640
for a uk business but the reality is is

518
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,000
your um developers or anybody else

519
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,400
that's eligible may not even be in the

520
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,720
uk so you have this outflow of

521
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,439
government sponsorship money to people

522
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,439
that aren't actually participating in

523
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,480
the uk economy in a direct way

524
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,919
and so you know what we're seeing is

525
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,080
this breakdown i think in a lot of ways

526
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,400
of saying like listen no i want to work

527
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,360
from spain from norway from wherever and

528
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,640
do my thing

529
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,360
but at the same time it's like you know

530
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,360
how do i get you know unemployment

531
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,000
benefits you know if i'm suddenly punted

532
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,400
out there so i i think it's a really

533
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,559
interesting thing from the australian

534
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,559
perspective and you know you do a lot of

535
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,880
travel are you finding that you know the

536
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,960
whole issue around the internet and

537
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,840
regulation and governance is and privacy

538
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,240
is like the next hot button topic or do

539
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,760
you think it's sort of like

540
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,880
overblown and you know alarmist

541
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,240
i think it it depends on your

542
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,120
perspective um

543
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,760
i i guess what what gets me with the

544
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,679
whole thing is that the fact that we

545
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,840
have an australian gov well okay the

546
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,679
australian government gets me anyway but

547
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,039
the fact that it's like we have an

548
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,480
australian government here passing

549
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,880
things like privacy laws on everything

550
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,320
from uh

551
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,320
what's sensitive personal data to how do

552
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,919
you disclose um or what's what's your

553
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:29,919
mandatory disclosure responsibilities

554
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,360
and then you guys

555
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,640
who for the most part are like me but

556
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,480
just with less sun right like you you

557
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,799
have different laws that that you

558
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,160
actually get a lot more protection from

559
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,840
what i do and then the folks in china

560
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,880
get something different and then you're

561
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,000
like well

562
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,960
we're all

563
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,640
on the same internet and we're all in

564
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,120
the same data breaches and we're all

565
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,799
ultimately the same sort of humans you

566
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,559
know why is it so

567
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,240
bizarrely different um it's you know on

568
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,480
a slightly more serious note when we see

569
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,400
a data breach in a part of the world

570
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,240
doesn't matter where it is and you guys

571
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,000
get certain levels of protection because

572
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,240
of the country that you live in

573
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,000
and i don't because of the country that

574
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,400
i live in like this is just it's just

575
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,400
ridiculous um

576
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,320
but this is also like the sort of i

577
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,320
guess the balkanization of of the world

578
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,760
right like everybody has these different

579
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,679
sort of little enclaves of different

580
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,760
laws and different policies

581
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,360
so i think that that's a really odd

582
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,600
thing i'd love to get some consistency

583
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,120
uh because i think it'll make a lot

584
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,559
easier on companies as well i mean look

585
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:29,679
at the way it is at the moment the

586
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,039
number of times i share a link on

587
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,120
twitter and it will be a link to some

588
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,440
like local american newspaper

589
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,200
and then people in europe will go i

590
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,200
can't read it they've blocked us because

591
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,000
we're europeans

592
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,679
and then they'll get really obnoxious

593
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,360
like well i'm glad because if they don't

594
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,280
want to adhere to gdpr then i don't want

595
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,640
them to

596
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,039
see my ip address yeah or maybe set a

597
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,640
cookie or something so

598
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,919
i thought it was actually a good story i

599
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,600
just wanted to share it leave me alone

600
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,160
i just find that weird right it's like

601
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,520
we all get together in the same room we

602
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,720
have some beers we're all the same sort

603
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,240
of people and then we go home we use the

604
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,840
same services and we somehow have like

605
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,720
totally different laws governing us

606
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,000
the thing is though

607
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,240
do you actually think it's going to be

608
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,240
unified at some point soon within our

609
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,679
lifetime i

610
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:16,880
genuinely

611
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,559
struggle to see that happening within

612
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,360
the next 10 or 15 years well hang on

613
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,480
how long are you planning to live you've

614
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,880
got 10 or 15 years left oh yeah what are

615
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,799
you doing man well overdue in the 20s

616
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:27,880
he's optimistic

617
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,039
[Laughter]

618
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,840
in 10 15

619
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,000
years uh i think you're right in so far

620
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,600
as i don't expect to see unification

621
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,720
from a from a government perspective um

622
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,480
i i honestly just don't know the answer

623
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,840
to it and it's just been really

624
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,520
interesting that the more time i've

625
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,360
spent with governments and and i just

626
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,960
remember one time in particular with

627
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,960
like eu regulators trying to have a

628
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,960
discussion around uh around data

629
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,159
breaches

630
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,679
and i found the right people and i went

631
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,799
through the right channels and we had a

632
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,640
very serious meeting i was sort of like

633
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,000
look um

634
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,320
yeah the objectives around personal

635
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,760
privacy and informed consent and all

636
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,640
this sort of thing they're really really

637
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,480
good um

638
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,080
but hackers don't really give a [ __ ] and

639
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,679
then they take all of this data and the

640
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:10,880
you know the question i'd like to put to

641
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,960
you is once this happens what is the

642
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,320
best thing that we can do with this you

643
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,960
know should we do it like have i been

644
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,080
toned but

645
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,799
maybe in a more uh open

646
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,320
sort of globally supported fashion and

647
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,760
let people oh no no but that wouldn't be

648
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,039
informed consent

649
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,200
uh but it's out there already so

650
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,960
it's almost like it has happened and it

651
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,320
doesn't fit your model of what you think

652
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,720
the world is what do we do now and it's

653
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,120
very very hard when when you push

654
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,880
lawmakers on that position to get any

655
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,640
sort of a straight answer because it is

656
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,640
a hard question to answer

657
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,440
that's true on the matter of having

658
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,799
um troy so in 2019 when we we last

659
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,039
caught

660
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,919
you told us but nobody publicly knew

661
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,440
about your plan then plan to to sell

662
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,960
have i've been pound

663
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,280
and we gave you a few ideas like donate

664
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,159
it to the eff or i think ian you said

665
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,960
we'll give you 50 quid for it yeah yeah

666
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,960
all of you that offer still stands

667
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,559
yeah if you need the money man all of

668
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,360
which were rejected out of hand yeah

669
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,760
but the question is

670
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,159
do you have any regrets not carrying

671
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,640
forward with that you don't and but

672
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,039
would you revisit the idea i i tell you

673
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,280
that the penny drop moment for me was

674
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,640
after i saw you guys because that would

675
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,720
have been june 2019 and then in july

676
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,400
i was in um

677
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,640
i was in san francisco with the the

678
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,039
bankers from kpmg and we were going all

679
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,799
these tech companies and it's it

680
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,080
seriously felt like an episode of

681
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,799
silicon valley you know the the the

682
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,720
long lost series but it was really

683
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,400
really good fun we were like going to

684
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,240
these big tech companies and we're going

685
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,919
to like these massive companies with the

686
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,760
names that you guys know them all and

687
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,880
you go in there and it'll be like

688
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,559
it's it's like a kid in a candy shop

689
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,679
sort of thing and then people come like

690
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:56,880
oh man i love you dude can we get

691
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,240
selfies and get stickers and everything

692
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,600
like [ __ ] well okay yeah yeah okay

693
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,679
and it was very very exciting but it was

694
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,200
also very very stressful it was just a

695
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,559
back to back to back to back people

696
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,640
coming into the office offices at kpmg

697
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,400
or we'd go out to the companies

698
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,600
and then

699
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,880
and then we got through i think it was

700
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,600
about two and a half weeks flat of that

701
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,559
and uh charlotte my fiance and i drove

702
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:21,039
from um we're driving from there to

703
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,720
yosemite and we drove to a ceremony and

704
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,559
i remember i had to have a call with a

705
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,799
big tech company that everybody knows

706
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,159
really really well i'm not going to say

707
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,280
who it is because what i'm going to say

708
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,240
next

709
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,120
but

710
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,039
i had a call with the person who would

711
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,320
be my boss

712
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,400
and i was just really really tired we're

713
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,919
in this beautiful spot in yosemite

714
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,520
overlooking the park and we'd found this

715
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,360
one spot with our signal

716
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,360
and and this guy was nice enough and he

717
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,120
was like you know uh

718
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,559
so troy what is your perfect day in the

719
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,320
office look like and he didn't know it

720
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,679
but he was on speakerphone and charlotte

721
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:50,799
was hitting the seat next to me as we

722
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,240
were in this car park and she just just

723
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,919
looked at me and which side was on i was

724
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,159
driving so she was looked over that way

725
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,159
and in my brain i'm going

726
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,520
i get up and i get on my desk and i do

727
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,880
whatever the [ __ ] i want why am i doing

728
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,880
this

729
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,240
it was just like an absolute penny drop

730
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,159
moment and that was august but we sort

731
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:08,960
of still

732
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,559
went through with the with the whole

733
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,080
process and

734
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,960
it just labored on and on and on and i

735
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,279
think as there is a passage of more time

736
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,559
i'll be able to talk more about what

737
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,640
actually happened and which company it

738
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,720
was that that that we were going to sell

739
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,240
to and then why they pulled the pin on

740
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:24,880
it

741
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,159
but

742
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,640
mate once it was over i was just like

743
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,799
i'm so glad that's over because i was

744
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,440
just starting to have these

745
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,600
i don't know like this feeling of dread

746
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,440
of no longer having the independent

747
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,600
lifestyle that i have

748
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,279
and then i sort of go back and go you

749
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,120
know why was i doing this in the first

750
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,320
place and what were the factors that

751
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,360
were driving that and i think that's

752
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,400
something that there's a good story

753
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,400
there i'm going to tell probably one day

754
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,400
but uh yeah when i got to the end of it

755
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,440
which was really feb last year

756
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,640
i was super happy and now it's

757
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,400
i'm just a lot more relaxed about it i

758
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,919
guess a lot more things in my my life a

759
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,320
lot more relaxed but i just either i

760
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,240
can't load enough data breaches i've got

761
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,480
a big backlog but i just get up each day

762
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,520
and i'm surrounded by so much iot [ __ ]

763
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,799
and stuff from the desk because i felt

764
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,400
like i wanted to make some new light

765
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,080
fittings or something i'll do some

766
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,039
heavily

767
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,880
later on it'll be fine

768
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,480
and i just don't worry about it really

769
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,880
as much um look

770
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,320
we'll see over time right because i

771
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,720
think it's a valuable service but

772
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,120
the open sourcing of it for the password

773
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,520
bit is is good that's growing massively

774
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,799
we're getting very very close to

775
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,360
launching the fbi password ingestion

776
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,080
process which is super super cool uh i

777
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,520
still think it's really awesome the fbi

778
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,400
is giving his passwords

779
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,200
well i mean the chinese have them the

780
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,200
russians have them so why not have i

781
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,960
been pulled right i don't know

782
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,880
it's out there yeah that's impressive i

783
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,480
just think that there's a lot of a lot

784
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,400
of really good stuff that can be done

785
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,840
yet that's just just in everyone's best

786
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,240
yeah fair enough listen

787
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,400
we're gonna rap and we managed to fill a

788
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,240
half hour but i've got one final

789
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,679
question for you before we let you

790
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,679
finish your glass of wine

791
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:06,960
so we've

792
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,679
talked about the themes and and when we

793
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,720
do our talks we we we reflect on a lot

794
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,559
of the things that you talk about yeah

795
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,400
we don't steal your material i might

796
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,679
point out

797
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,799
but uh well not all of it um

798
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,279
but the question is what what's the big

799
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,039
theme that we need to be thinking about

800
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,559
so in the past we've talked about

801
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,440
breaches we've talked about https

802
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,520
um all the common sense things that

803
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,000
people seem to not find common

804
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,440
what should we all be thinking about now

805
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,679
or is it just more of the same

806
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,440
i think it's it's more of a saying to a

807
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,720
degree but the the aspect that i'm i

808
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,559
just find myself being really interested

809
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,600
in more recently is like that the human

810
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,240
side of security so how do people

811
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,720
interact with security paradigms

812
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,440
uh you know passwords is a great example

813
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,880
i don't really have a problem with

814
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,799
passwords as a concept i've got lots of

815
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,880
issues but you know what what makes them

816
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,039
difficult well arbitrary complexity

817
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,880
criteria and mandated rotation things

818
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,720
like this because that really doesn't

819
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,200
consider how humans use systems

820
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,600
uh yeah 2fa is another great example 2fa

821
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,279
is a technically brilliant

822
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,159
implementation even via sms it's still a

823
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,520
lot better than 1fa you know two

824
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,440
like there's a couple of so many people

825
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,159
like using sms for 2fa is even worse

826
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,640
than having only password it's like

827
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,320
the the number two is bigger than the

828
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,240
number one right so that means it's

829
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,840
better but when you add something it's

830
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,520
better and then we can just like sit

831
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,960
around and argue about how much better

832
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,720
it is but

833
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,880
they're all better to some degree

834
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,600
but

835
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,360
oh man try setting it up for my mum and

836
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,320
dad that's like good luck with that

837
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,399
because it's terrible and then i was i

838
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,000
was commenting actually early about an

839
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,840
hour and a half ago on zuma weekly video

840
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,919
about um a coin market cap that

841
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:53,279
obviously had an enumeration vector

842
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,240
somewhere

843
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,520
and they had massively overly aggressive

844
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,799
captures so you know the captures where

845
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,399
you've got to like pick all the buses

846
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:01,919
and there's like a three by three square

847
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,679
yeah and then you pick a bus and then

848
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,440
square slowly fades out and you have to

849
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,440
wait to see if another bus comes back or

850
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,799
maybe it's just a push bike instead in

851
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,159
which case you can click on it and then

852
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:11,840
they do that and you're like oh thank

853
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,679
god i've done that and they're like

854
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,520
click on all the traffic lights oh [ __ ]

855
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,960
not again

856
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,559
and i just think it's really

857
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:21,279
interesting about uh how we try and

858
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,440
solve security problems

859
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,679
and the impact on on humans and i i

860
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,279
think this is a really really big

861
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:30,159
opportunity about how do we make make it

862
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,039
human accessible because it only works

863
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,520
when humans use it

864
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,159
yeah yeah i agree completely agree

865
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,559
and on that note

866
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,799
