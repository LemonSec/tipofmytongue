1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,520
good luck parker and we'll let we'll

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:02,240
leave

3
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,480
the bummer of this is that the the

4
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,160
speaker card for me has me with short

5
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,000
hair and i've since run out my hair a

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,840
significant amount so

7
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,840
uh i was hoping to like full surprise on

8
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,000
you all but just just just take look at

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,519

10
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,359
long hair and it looks better than

11
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,760

parker take it away my friend

25
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,200

mentioned my name is parker seaman and

27
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,760
i'm going to do a little talk here on uh

28
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,879
burnout

29
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,480
um but first

30
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,000
to to

31
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,680
do this right i'll talk about myself for

32
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,440
a little while um so who am i um i am my

33
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,280
name is parker seaman as mentioned i am

34
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,239
a

35
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,360
senior in um grad school studying cyber

36
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,240
defense and also working as a devsecops

37
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,840
engineer

38
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,520
always really enjoyed

39
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,680
learning about security and also being

40
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,360
able to share what i've learned with

41
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,640
others

42
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,159
what i found is the most interesting

43
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,600
part of

44
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,360
the cyber security world for me is the

45
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,439
intersection between people and

46
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,880
computers

47
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,400
and how all those relate to each other

48
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,439
um it's because of that i think that the

49
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,840
talk about burnout and mental health is

50
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,000
is worth talking about as with these

51
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,439
computers really don't do anything

52
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,640
unless they have a person behind them

53
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,759
um

54
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,799
so that's who i am and here is

55
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,320
why should you listen to me um well to

56
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,960
be quite honest i don't have a lot to

57
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,000
compel you here i am just standard

58
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,360
regular guy

59
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,520
with my main qualification here being

60
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,759
that i have experienced burnout as i

61
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,759
imagine other people have

62
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:04,719
um

63
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,040
which is why i want to present this talk

64
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,280
as a set of ideas but not as a

65
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,038
definitive solution

66
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,360
uh the problem of burnout cannot be

67
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,599
easily encompassed fully in the uh in

68
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,000
the time that this talk takes up but

69
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,920
however what i can do is bring some

70
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,360
attention to the issue and i hope that

71
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,080
doing so we can

72
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,800
encourage further conversation and

73
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,160
um potentially improvements to

74
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,959
um

75
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,440
the the problem of burnout

76
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,760
so now that i've explained myself a

77
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,760
little bit let's get into this what is

78
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,800
burnout uh burnout is a series of racing

79
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,640
games developed by criterion games the

80
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,160
first two games are published by claim

81
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,920
entertainment well later installments

82
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,480
and this is a funny joke uh what burnout

83
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,959
actually is is um well if you go by the

84
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,000
the who's classification her definition

85
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,640
is burnout is a syndrome

86
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,440
uh conceptual sorry conceptualized as a

87
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,280
result of chronic workspace stress that

88
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,599
has not been successfully managed

89
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,159
and the ways that this manifests itself

90
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,879
is you have people who are in a

91
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,360
in a in a career a position that they

92
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,080
have sought after um

93
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,319
work to the point where they no longer

94
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,599
find it

95
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,440
rewarding or engaging and can lead to

96
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,040
the point of people wanting to

97
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,040
leave that career entirely

98
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,200
uh just because they

99
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,200
can't be in that kind of environment

100
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,560
anymore

101
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,840
so

102
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,360
i mean why

103
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,959
you could it could be considered like

104
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,720
why why should this

105
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,519
matter if let's say there's a i hear in

106
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,920
the news frequently about how there is a

107
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,440
shortage of security engineers and more

108
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,680
people are going into that field to fill

109
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,360
the gaps well

110
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,760
part of the reason it first of all i

111
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,760
think the first reason it should matter

112
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,280
um

113
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,319
is

114
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,720
if you're if you're a hiring manager or

115
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,720
if you're looking it from just a purely

116
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,120
a utilitarian point of view

117
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,640
that

118
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,840
it stress people are less productive uh

119
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,599
plain and simple so if you have all

120
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,879
these people who are experiencing

121
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,519
burnout trying to perform their jobs

122
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,759
they're just not going to do it as good

123
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,199
what i think is a

124
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,000
stronger factor for why we

125
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,800
should be addressing burnout is

126
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,120
just taking care of people you spend a

127
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,120
significant portion of your life in at

128
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,520
your job doing doing work

129
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,680
and i just don't think it's right that

130
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,440
people should be having to experience

131
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,800
all that time

132
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,160
with

133
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,440
feelings of stress and anxiety and

134
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,680
depression and all these terrible things

135
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,440
that burnout can lead

136
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,320
people to have

137
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,840
so

138
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,120
if we if we have this issue

139
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,600
why are if this is an issue like how do

140
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,440
why is it happening in

141
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,360
uh the first place

142
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,479
and to try to answer this question i

143
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,479
asked around to a number of different

144
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,560
people friends i have and other people

145
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,880
of working in cyber security industry to

146
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,720
try to get an idea of

147
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,680
why

148
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,440
we have this

149
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,680
and i had gone into this with the

150
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,600
thought that it could be pinned down to

151
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,320
just a couple of reasons that if i got a

152
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,520
list of them then we could better

153
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,039
address it

154
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,639
what i found is that the reasons people

155
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,880
feel burned out are as

156
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,280
complex and

157
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,400
varied as individuals are

158
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,400
themselves

159
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,680
that said i do believe that there is an

160
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,080
overarching issue that plagues people

161
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,960
here that there is not enough support

162
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,840
and to give an example uh in a previous

163
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,600
stop of mine

164
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,600
uh there was many times where i did feel

165
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,720
overwhelmed with the workload i had um

166
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,280
both whether it was just regular

167
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,720
workplace tasks or activities or when

168
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,840
there was a crunch time with

169
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,680
uh certain events going on that would

170
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,160
stress out me and other co-workers but i

171
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,039
never felt burnt out and i think i can

172
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,280
contribute a significant portion of that

173
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,520
of my manager at the time

174
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,639
was very good at making time for all of

175
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,960
the people of her team

176
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,520
um would have one like

177
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,199
15 to 30 minute one-on-ones with every

178
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,440
member of the team every week so people

179
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,880
could be able to talk about not just

180
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,280
what's going on at work but

181
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,960
individual things that are going on in

182
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,880
everybody's life that if they that might

183
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,199
be affecting the work flow

184
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,800
and

185
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,120
it wasn't always something that i needed

186
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,400
but it was something that

187
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,280
led me feel better to know that i was

188
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,599
being supported

189
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,319
and that's from my perspective on this

190
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,080
issue and

191
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,400
talking to other people it seems like a

192
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,039
lot of problems people have

193
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,880
would be

194
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,520
not necessarily always fixed but at

195
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,520
least assisted with better support from

196
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,800
those around them um and i want to

197
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,199
expand that out from just a leadership

198
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,880
point but from

199
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,160
just a

200
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,160
community as a whole

201
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,039
which um i want to have that play into

202
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,800
the next point of

203
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,800
if those are the kinds of things that

204
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,759
can potentially help fix this issue of

205
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,120
burnout

206
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,560
uh what can we as individuals do to help

207
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,599
better

208
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,199
um address this issue

209
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,479
um

210
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,039
and like i've mentioned with bad slide

211
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,680
time and communication is key um but

212
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,759
going back to what can we do to try to

213
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,919
fix this

214
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,280
i

215
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,840
have to go back to i'm just some guy and

216
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,919
i can't fix this myself

217
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,039
um

218
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,599
if i could i would say there should be

219
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,440
better standards for how we treat people

220
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,080
how we engage with our

221
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,680
workforces and all that kind of stuff

222
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,479
but

223
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:09,360
i

224
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,440
don't have that kind of power all i can

225
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,319
do is encourage us to continue to make

226
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,199
this

227
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,080
um

228
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,280
known make sure we communicate it and

229
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,599
work together to create a understanding

230
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,479
that this is a thing that does happen

231
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,479
that

232
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,800
people coming into this career who

233
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,400
experience this and have had not had it

234
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,880
before can know that

235
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,360
it's okay and it is important to take

236
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,200
care of yourself

237
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,080
um

238
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,479
because you

239
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,399
you matter that's that's the main part

240
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,240
about that

241
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,560
um

242
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,760
i

243
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,720
i think that

244
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,560
it's just a continued discussion

245
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,560
understanding and cooperation is the

246
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,480
best way forward we have

247
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,959
to address this mental health issue we

248
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,600
have in our career and through that we

249
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,800
can

250
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,480
work towards better standards and

251
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,240
um

252
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,480
treatment of

253
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,000
uh of everyone around us

254
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,040
i

255
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,560
finished my talk last year um with it

256
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,240
with a little musical number and that

257
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,720
was that was fun but the tone of this

258
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,959
talk i feel like is different from that

259
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,680
one and i am apologizing to them i

260
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,399
apologize but it doesn't feel right to

261
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,440
do it this time so i will end with just

262
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,399
um a simple notion of

263
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,560
um just be good to each other

264
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,720
thank you

265
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,640
and that's

266
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,320
probably the best advice ever it's

267
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,320
pretty pretty damn good advice isn't it

268
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,920
it's the classic don't be a dick and i

269
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,080
think we've all we've all

270
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,839
been a dick from time to time and i

271
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,040
think you learn from it you'd like to

272
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,160
thank you anyway yeah yeah you know

273

277
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,480

screenshot and then share it on the

286
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,640

watching you can read but if you're not

293
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,640
watching and you're listening and you

294

299
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,519
the blog is down right now because my

300
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,440
reverse proxy is broken and

301
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,360
grad school is keeping me very busy and

302
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,959
while i'd like to have my blog up i paid

303
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,560
enough money for the for the classes so

304
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,240
i should probably do that first

305
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,440
um

306
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,640
