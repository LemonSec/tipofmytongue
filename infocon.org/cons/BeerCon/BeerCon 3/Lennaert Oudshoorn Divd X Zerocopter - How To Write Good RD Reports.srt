like us privately

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,879
vulnerability disclosure the do's and

20
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,239
don'ts uh it's time to tell literally

21

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,960
looking forward to this so

24
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,039
please take it away thank you scott and

25
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,719
like you said i will be talking about

26
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,719
the do's and don'ts of vulnerability

27
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,719
disclosure i'm going to start off with a

28
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,559
quick small introduction who am i

29
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,719
um well i'm lanard

30
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,438
and i like to press buttons randomly and

31
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,439
sometimes funny things happen and if

32
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,840
they have these things happen then i try

33
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,240
to disclose them to the people that can

34
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,920
do something with them and i try to do

35
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,000
so responsibly of course

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,159
um in my working life i'm a triage

37
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,240
officer at xerocopter which is a managed

38
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,920
bug bounty platform we also manage

39
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,840
coordinated vulnerability

40
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,600
policies for our clients

41
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,080
so i see a lot of disclosures coming in

42
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,439
and reports

43
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,200
a lot of them are really good but i also

44
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,240
see some common mistakes people make

45
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,560
various funny things and from that role

46
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,000
i can really talk to

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,640
seeing a lot of them but i also do a lot

48
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,200
of them i'm the research coordinator at

49
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,880
the dutch institute for vulnerability

50
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,000
disclosure

51
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,600
you might have heard this name in the

52
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,840
media last year when we were

53
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,320
in the news a lot around the massive

54
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,320
ransomware attack that happened on case

55
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,079
software

56
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,680
researchers from our team had already

57
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,360
identified some of these vulnerabilities

58
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,040
and we were in the process of disclosing

59
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,360
these to cassaya and working with them

60
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,880
to see them resolved

61
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,520
but sadly our efforts were

62
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,520
not enough and we didn't manage to get

63
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,120
everything fixed before the attack

64
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,319
happened

65
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,319
but we did do a lot of

66
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,480
disclosures

67
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,280
with this team to cassea and two other

68
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,520
companies we try to keep the internet

69
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,520
safe that way

70
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,200
i have a small disclaimer for this talk

71
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,360
there might be some mature language

72
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,879
and i really want to stress that when i

73
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,680
say a hacker i do mean a good guy

74
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,640
and not a cyber criminal

75
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,599
and

76
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,400
the

77
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,640
responsible disclosure starts of course

78
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,800
with finding a bug you might have been

79
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,440
hacking on one of the known platforms

80
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,560
um

81
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,319
these have many bug bounty platforms

82
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,000
that you can legally hack on and

83
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,239
disclose your report but sometimes you

84
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,840
also find something when you're just

85
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,920
using the internet or like me trying to

86
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,920
buy shoes and then you

87
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,480
put funny things into search boxes and

88
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,239
funnier things happen

89
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:03,280
and then

90
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,879
the next thing after finding something

91
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:05,599
is

92
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,440
starting to figure out who to disclose

93
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,560
this to sometimes that's really clear

94
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,360
when people have a security.txt

95
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,640
or they have a beautiful link to a

96
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,080
responsible disclosure policy in their

97
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,800
footer or sometimes you simply google

98
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,720
the company or organization you want to

99
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,800
disclose to and you find a link to the

100
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,040
right place to disclose but it's not

101
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,560
always this easy

102
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,920
exactly

103
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,200
sometimes you have to do a little

104
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,120
company options like you go onto

105
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,959
linkedin try to find members of their

106
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,319
security team

107
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,000
and try to figure out who can take your

108
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,720
report and actually take action to it

109
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,640
and if that doesn't work

110
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,400
you have to go to their customer support

111
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,799
or email their info at address and then

112
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,799
usually you get someone that does not

113
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,400
have a clue what you're trying to tell

114
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,239
them or that thinks they're getting

115
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,000
scammed or they just won't respond at

116
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,040
all

117
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,480
and then your last

118
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,319
resort can be to

119
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,760
try to get some attention for it

120
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,920
publicly but this is also going to

121
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,760
probably get to the social media team

122
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,280
and not to someone who really

123
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,560
understands a lot about cyber security

124
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,280
so

125
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,360
these options are far less ideal and i

126
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,360
would want every company to have a

127
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,360
security txt or responsible disclosure

128
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,360
policy listed on their website

129
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,320
because

130
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,918
disclosing like this

131
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,519
always

132
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,440
takes a lot more effort and makes it a

133
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,600
little harder on researchers to

134
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,040
get attention for vulnerability they

135
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,400
found

136
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,639
but when you finally figure out who and

137
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,560
where to disclose to you're going to

138
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,160
have to send them a message

139
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,360
you could send a message like this

140
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,600
simply says hi i found a vulnerability

141
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,680
please kindly reply back to me

142
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,280
which is weird because he's submitting

143
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,759
it on vulnerability disclosure program

144
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:44,880
already

145
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,400
so he's in the right place but there's

146
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,560
zero disclosure zero information just

147
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,160
mill me

148
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,520
this

149
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,280
is not going to work this is not going

150
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,600
to get you a good response i can promise

151
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,960
you that

152
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,440
the same for these messages

153
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,680
they're both what we call back bounties

154
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,639
like

155
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,080
they literally mail the owner of a

156
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,720
website hey i have something for you

157
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,639
will you give me money

158
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,880
this looks like a scam it is often a

159
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,479
scam and you should not be trying to

160
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,360
disclose things like this

161
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,120
but when you're disclosing and making

162
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,960
your message make sure it doesn't look

163
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,320
like this and you're trying to do your

164
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,120
best

165
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,000
then

166
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,440
you want to get a sense of urgency

167
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,120
across because you found it'll just be

168
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,199
very important it's urgent and you want

169
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,199
them to fix it so you're going to urge

170
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,759
them to take action do something and of

171
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,280
course you want to help them out and

172
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,880
give them a lot of information so you

173
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,120
put a lot of links to information

174
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,039
i don't know if anyone recognizes these

175
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,560
points but

176
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,400
if you've taken any fishing training

177
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,440
you'll

178
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,000
have red flags flying up right now at

179
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,039
urgent

180
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,520
take action and a lot of lings in it so

181
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,360
don't do this either that's going to

182
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,360
look like phishing people won't say good

183
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,120
to it it might even get filtered out by

184
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,720
spam filters if you're disposing via

185
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,240
email

186
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,319
so how should you do it

187
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,000
you should send them a clear description

188
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,280
of the issue tell them what's wrong

189
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,039
include steps to reproduce it because

190
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,240
obviously i want to test the

191
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,840
vulnerability you're disclosing is

192
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,440
actually present

193
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,840
and you want to highlight the impact why

194
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,080
they should care what's this gonna do to

195
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,680
a business

196
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,600
and if you have any idea about how they

197
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,800
could fix it

198
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,400
please obviously to include those as

199
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,560
well

200
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,880
a good example of a good message is this

201
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,479
one it's from

202
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,000
cyber gimmins

203
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,440
who happens to work at one of the

204
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,280
spontaneous events

205
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,080
and he writes a nice email about an sql

206
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,319
server being open and passwords being

207
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,600
disclosed

208
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,759
in error messages

209
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,240
and all round the message is good

210
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,479
he explains what they could do to fix it

211
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,720
what the impact is how it happens how he

212
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,400
found it

213
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,360
and

214
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,599
the response however

215
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,199
is less good

216
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,960
they're emailing him back with you send

217
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,960
us an email we're not interested in

218
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,400
discussing the contents and as far as

219
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,960
we're concerned the matter is closed

220
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,120
don't respond like this to a responsible

221
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,000
disclosure you're being really rude and

222
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,599
annoying to a person that's trying to

223
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,840
help you as you can see the researcher

224
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,919
in this case is also fairly annoyed at

225
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,400
the arrogant response he's receiving

226
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,800
so no this is not how you should be

227
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,560
responding to a

228
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,319
responsible or coordinated vulnerability

229
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,080
disclosure

230
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,880
you also should not respond by suing the

231
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,960
person that's trying to help you you

232
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,720
think this is really easy to not sue the

233
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,479
person that's trying to help you like in

234
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,160
this case rob fans

235
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,199
um

236
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,440
some usernames and passwords

237
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,680
i believe it was in a github repository

238
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,280
and he disclosed that to the

239
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,039
organization and they responded with

240
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,360
legal with threats of legal action

241
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,479
so yeah don't sue your researcher seems

242
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,960
easy and we found out earlier this month

243
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,120
that it wasn't easy

244
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,240
another

245
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,680
person doing a disclosure to an

246
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,039
organization

247
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,599
gets in this case investigated

248
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,360
by the police because he's trying to

249
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,759
help and in this case

250
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,199
there was a lot of laughter about if

251
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,039
there was even a hack because all they

252
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,120
did was inspect the page that the web

253
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,599
server was sending back to their browser

254
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,440
so yeah there was hardly any hacking and

255
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,360
he was just trying to help but now gets

256
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,720
investigated by the police

257
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,199
another way not to respond to disclosure

258
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,039
is this one and this is what you often

259
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,599
see what happens when it gets to uh

260
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,360
customer support

261
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,800
instead of someone that understands the

262
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,919
system and understands cyber security

263
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,839
and they respond with it looks like

264
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,440
you're trying to add javascript in the

265
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,519
name of your gallery don't do that there

266
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,679
is no xss just don't put javascript in

267
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,000
the field there is no issue here

268
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,040
obviously

269
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,800
not what you want as a researcher either

270
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,120
in the response

271
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,080
so what should you do when respawning

272
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,640
first of all don't panic you're not

273
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,560
under attack someone's trying to help

274
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,680
you

275
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,000
don't ignore the report either

276
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,600
so respond send a message

277
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,720
get in touch with the person that's

278
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,000
trying to help you

279
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,760
don't sue your reporter as we've covered

280
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,720
before

281
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,720
don't make them sign ndas they're

282
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,800
helping you voluntarily

283
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,040
so don't put all kinds of paperwork and

284
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,519
contracts on their nose

285
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,360
communicate the timeline back

286
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,279
how long you think this might take to

287
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,760
fix you and let them know that you're

288
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,279
working on it

289
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,120
and inform them once the issue is

290
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,959
actually fixed

291
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,880
but also people that are reporting

292
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,760
sometimes don't communicate too well

293
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,839
we can see

294
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,920
here this is a person

295
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,600
disclosing something on uber's

296
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,320
bookmaning platform and um it was out of

297
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,160
scope so it got closed and i was okay

298
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,440
with that and then apparently they um

299
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,360
cluster is not applicable and deducted

300
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,200
his points for it

301
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,399
which

302
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,320
made him less than happy and he responds

303
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,440
with

304
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,920
you know bleep bleep bleep and lots of

305
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,680
swear words and he ends his message

306
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,720
calling on

307
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,640
the rudest thing he could think of when

308
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,800
insulting uber and he calls them bloody

309
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,880
taxi drivers

310
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,560
this is not how you should be

311
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,399
communicating to anyone

312
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,360
if you're trying to help

313
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,120
someone will not want to listen to you

314
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,440
after you communicate like this

315
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,920
there's more good examples of this the

316
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,519
hacker won't disclose reports or

317
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,360
sometimes i called mine for good laughs

318
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,959
about this

319
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,440
here someone found

320
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,120
etc password was exposed or they felt so

321
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,680
and the reddit staff responds with no

322
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,000
it's not exposed this is a joke it's a

323
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,240
fake passwd file

324
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,760
as a joke and none of the other

325
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,160
endpoints under etc will respond with

326
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,600
anything

327
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,519
but instead of communicating and reading

328
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,000
what he's been told he just tells them

329
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,040
but the link works

330
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,360
clearly a case of not reading what

331
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,800
you're being told not engaging in

332
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,240
communication and trying to understand

333
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,200
another point of view

334
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,200
we'll see the same in this next report

335
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,360
he's uh reporting an xss

336
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,120
which is normally a very valid look i

337
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,120
love hunting for xs

338
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,200
but he

339
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,920
um includes steps of reproduction that

340
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,079
are questionable he opens the death

341
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,720
tools and types in an alert that will

342
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,880
absolutely work to open alert but

343
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,200
there's no actual xss here

344
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,839
and later on he doubles down to use a

345
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,680
phrase that's called lows

346
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,480
and

347
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,440
he asks the poor person working there

348
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,320
are you new to this job

349
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,519
very rude

350
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,000
again not working with the other party

351
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,040
when you're trying to disclose

352
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,480
vulnerability well you should be trying

353
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,240
to work together when reporting

354
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,200
something and resolving it

355
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,160
so

356
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,560
how do you should you communicate

357
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,040
clearly remain professional give clear

358
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,839
answers to questions asked and read what

359
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,440
people are actually asking are telling

360
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,680
you so respect their decisions

361
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,760
sometimes you might have a valid book

362
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,279
but a business will decide not to act

363
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,800
upon it because there's no real impact

364
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,720
for them and this can be a valid

365
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,480
decision and if the decision is made

366
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,839
respect it

367
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,399
and once a bug is resolved don't go

368
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,760
begging

369
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,519
if you want to get paid for your bugs

370
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,600
hunt on book bounty

371
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,000
platforms or programs that have rewards

372
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,200
if you're doing coordinated or

373
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,279
responsible vulnerability disclosure

374
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,440
then you're not guaranteed a reward

375
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,440
it's nice to get something

376
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,760
but don't respond like this no bounty

377
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,000
please messages

378
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,639
but for a company once it's resolved it

379
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,800
is nice to reward the person helping you

380
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,639
you don't have to give them tons of

381
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,000
money especially on coordinated

382
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,399
vulnerability disclosure but

383
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,880
a place on a wall of fame or a nice

384
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,000
t-shirt

385
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,839
are always very welcome

386
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,120
and i believe you should allow it to

387
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,480
disclose publicly after it's been

388
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,519
resolved

389
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,519
i think it's important because reporters

390
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,959
want to show off their work which is why

391
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,560
the whole fame is always nice because

392
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,040
for a lot of people reporting things

393
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,959
the things they found act in a sense

394
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,040
like their cv

395
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,720
and we don't want others to need to

396
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,279
reinvent the wheel so disclose publicly

397
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,720
and we can all learn from each other's

398
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,639
mistakes

399
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,800
and keep the internet better and safer

400
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,240
that way

401
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,000
and you tell the world you're taking

402
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,720
security seriously if you

403
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,399
show that you've received the report

404
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,839
acted on it

405
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,600
and made your product better and it's a

406
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,760
lot nicer to be saying we take the

407
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,760
security serious when telling people you

408
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,760
fixed an issue then when you have to use

409
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,160
that phrase in a database notification

410
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,279
if you want to know more about this how

411
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,120
you should run your responsible

412
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,120
disclosure policy or how you should be

413
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,360
reporting and a bit of guidelines that

414
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,880
you can keep to

415
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,600
the os project has a really nice cheat

416
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,440
sheet about this

417
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,519
and

418
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,839
you can go there check it out urls and

419
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,000
slides

420
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,279
and that's it

421
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,480
does anyone have any questions

422
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,920
you can reach me on twitter or in the

423
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,959
discord if you have any questions

424
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,240
yeah no that was that was awesome yeah

425
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,800
fantastic i know we have a lot of chats

426
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,320
about vulnerability disclosure and

427
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,639
actually we kind of disagree on a few

428
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,639
points

429
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,959
oh yeah completely i'm

430
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,320
it pro-dumping at the proof of concept

431
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,440
on twitter for likes and shares

432
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,680
likes likes and shares very fast

433
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,079
both sides and i can understand from

434
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,560
both sides the challenges but i've also

435
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,040
yeah i've seen the sides where you just

436
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,880
don't get the response and then there's

437
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,199
nothing more frustrating than facing

438
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,800
something like that no you're you're

439
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,639
absolutely right um

440
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,360
i

441
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,680
i do occasionally i don't do it on it

442
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,199
for a bug bounty platform i don't do it

443
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,120
for any

444
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,880
particular reason other than hey i'm

445
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,240
bored late at night i'm going to have a

446
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,000
look at this oh i found this thing i

447
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,199
kind of like when you just want to buy

448
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,880
shoes and you oh all right i better

449
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,959
email them about this and the responses

450
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,120
i get back to pretty standard i mean

451
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,639
some of the stuff i've run past you

452
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,320
first going does it sound okay is this

453
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,440
legit

454
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,760
and the response is you get back or

455
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,920
anything from no comment

456
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,560
and you fix it no comment and they don't

457
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,680
fix it

458
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,639
or

459
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,760
see you in court you're just like okay

460
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,519
there must be some middle ground but

461
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,959
like i can imagine they're they're

462
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,360
dealing with a big bounty as you

463
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,240
mentioned

464
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,680
b

465
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,600
decks that are just like hey you've got

466
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,199
a problem with this no we don't yeah you

467
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,199
do it no we don't so guys it's like

468
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,800
you need to pay out before i give you

469
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,959
the details of it

470
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,720
that will always get such a bad result

471
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,000
for me like

472
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,839
that's not how it works but yeah i

473
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,600
definitely believe this is for both

474
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,000
sides both of them had to disclose and

475
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,959
definitely on how to respond as well

476
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,320
yeah definitely

477
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,279
it highlights that there's a

478
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,680
communication breakdown like we need to

479
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,120
get better at communicating like we're

480
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,880
really good at the tech stuff but

481
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,519
communication skills are like

482
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,279
we need to we need to find that middle

483
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,120
ground to be able to translate from tech

484
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,240
to to anybody and from anybody to tech

485
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,920
so that we all understand each other and

486
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,560
can talk the same damn language

487
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,959
would you say understanding each other

488
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,639
i think a lot of people report something

489
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,480
and for them it's a huge find and they

490
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,839
feel like it's absolutely the most

491
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,040
important thing in the world at that

492
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,079
point

493
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,279
but for a company they might have a

494
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,519
million other things going on so have a

495
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,360
little bit of empathy and try to

496
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,560
understand where the other person is

497
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,320
coming from

498
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,120
yeah context is a massive massive

499
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,720
massive part of it as well like if

500
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,480
you're emailing them in the middle of an

501
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,759
audit like they're not going to respond

502
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,759
to you for probably a couple of weeks or

503
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,759
months yeah it might be spicy when they

504
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:36,880
do respond

505
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,240
like if you email them in the middle of

506
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,199
a pen test they're probably going to

507
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,160
think it's apprentice exactly but um

508
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,079
yeah so a couple of people dropped some

509
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,560
questions in the chat um

510
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,680
thanks rag for dropping a a massive

511
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,360
charles dickens novel of a question in

512
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,959
the chat so i'm going to attempt to try

513
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,240
and read this now

514
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,639
uh so rag said question number one i

515
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,480
noticed your list of finding points of

516
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,120
contact to disclose vulnerability do you

517
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,959
think the isa sees an isaos

518
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,799
have a place within their sectors as

519
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,880
middlemen for finding points of contact

520
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,720
at organizations where that trust

521
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,359
relationship already exists to connect

522
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,359
researchers with the correct people

523
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,520
within the potentially impacted

524
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,199
organizations

525
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,039
that's a mouthful

526
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,119
absolutely great question

527
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,280
yes this is the short answer that can

528
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,919
really help um i think it might be hard

529
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:28,720
to

530
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,080
advertise

531
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,760
who you can disclose to because not all

532
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,679
these organizations cover their entire

533
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,360
branch not all

534
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,840
companies might be connected to them

535
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,960
so

536
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,080
it's not as easy but yeah if you

537
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,039
have

538
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,240
uh if you cover a branch and you

539
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,480
can take vulnerability reports for

540
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,640
companies in a branch

541
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,400
then absolutely advertise it and be

542
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,720
clear on who you can and can't contact i

543
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,320
definitely believe there's a role for uh

544
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,880
for this year

545
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,760
yeah i think that kind of feeds ties in

546
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,960
nicely with the point that troy was

547
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,240
making earlier about this kind of

548
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,760
unified

549
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,760
presence and unified sort of mindset

550
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,840
unified

551
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,480
he'd say cyber laws almost in cyber

552
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,640
rules and cyber guidance

553
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,280
globally and also it's it's good because

554
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,919
you're now talking to folks that are

555
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,160
part of the community so they can give

556
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,640
you further guidance and mentorship but

557
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,200
also um when you get a call from an isac

558
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,600
or a national um agency like the nca um

559
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,919
they'll have vetted that

560
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:38,960
and and

561
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,039
they'll have identified that this is

562
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,679
actually an issue too right so getting

563
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,559
that validation of your results uh of

564
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,039
what you think you found from

565
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,600
another suspected third party um and

566
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,280
then you can essentially do what they

567
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,120
did to solarwinds which was when

568
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,400
mandiant got hacked um they investigated

569
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,919
and then they went to microsoft to

570
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,039
validate

571
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,120
we're seeing this you know look at what

572
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,679
we've discovered okay now let's both

573
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,200
kind of approach

574
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,400
everyone like every government agency

575
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,600
and say

576
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,720
we're gonna

577
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,640
we need to talk to these guys

578
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,360
you know and it just it makes it uh you

579
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,240
know a lot more i think of a of a better

580
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,600
sort of system

581
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,000
when you know the work is validated

582
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,320
absolutely no absolutely i think a big

583
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,559
problem with this seems to me that uh

584
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,080
there's a lot of

585
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,919
smaller companies that do have a

586
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,440
presence on the internet but are just

587
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,840
simply not covered by any of these

588
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,200
organizations

589
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,880
they're so small that they don't really

590
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,120
have the contact points

591
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,640
so they'll just get missed i think

592
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,120
you're really going to see that

593
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,120
the more the bigger companies the richer

594
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,440
companies definitely have their security

595
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,600
housing order to a certain extent

596
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,960
and

597
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,039
the smaller like small medium business

598
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,200
they're just gonna get missed for a

599
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,640
whole while before we get this right

600
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,159
no i totally agree um

601
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,760
rag has asked a second question but

602
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,600
before i get to that question

603
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,600
i jenny has dropped in the chat the

604
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,919
existence of a security.txt file is

605
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,159
often a good indication that company or

606
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,320
at least one individual in the company

607
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,480
takes security seriously wish more

608
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,840
companies did this simple stuff i

609
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,679
actually had a chat recently i think you

610
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,480
know about this one uh leonard but i had

611
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,640
a chat recently with someone and it was

612
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,480
trying to convince

613
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,120
an organization to put security.txt into

614
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,080
place

615
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,840
no one understood it apart from this one

616
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,360
person and it got to the point where it

617
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,320
was like

618
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,720
forgiveness rather than permission

619
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,120
because it's important and people didn't

620
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,559
take it seriously they didn't understand

621
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,159
it and they thought it was useless i'm

622
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,080
going to play devil's advocate here oh

623
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,880
sorry

624
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,200
i think that creates a really dangerous

625
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,960
scenario of that one person leaving

626
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,880
security txt still being there and

627
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,480
people trying to get in touch with

628
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,159
getting responses getting only more

629
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,799
frustrated

630
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,880
yeah and the other thing to add was

631
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,760
security tax in your example is a lot of

632
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,440
organizations especially smaller

633
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,440
companies they have no clue about

634
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,840
security that's not their fault it's

635
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,159
like trying to ask us well why don't you

636
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,799
fix my my card side that's using a

637
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,760
modern engine would go well

638
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,679
why should i know anything we have to

639
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,679
start engaging with people and explain

640
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,000
it to them and get them to understand

641
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,159
the importance and value of it rather

642
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,400
than you have to have a security.text

643
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,200
file why are you just have to have it

644
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,200
like we need to explain the wire parts

645
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,720
and that's one thing i think we often

646
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,120
fail to do because we know if we assume

647
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,240
everyone else knows yeah and i think

648
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,400
that's the person that you can do a lot

649
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,960
more aftercare as well because you

650
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,919
you know you can disclose a

651
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,440
vulnerability but if you're not telling

652
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,039
them how to fix it or helping them fix

653
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,320
it a small company that doesn't

654
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,840
understand securities is not going to

655
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,840
get it

656
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,039
there's a really interesting point about

657
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,360
the person leaving though um so i have

658
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,520
seen that before where you know you can

659
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,919
find legacy stuff and two three five

660
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,919
years ago that person cared but they

661
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,240
they're gone this is

662
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,400
my opinion is is that the security txt

663
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,919
needs to be managed by risking

664
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,919
compliance not actually the security

665
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,440
department because the security

666
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,120
department won't want to engage it's

667
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,440
like no we're protecting our perimeter

668
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,120
we don't want to talk about this issue

669
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,520
but governance and risk and compliance

670
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,919
might actually pick it up the problem is

671
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,440
the problem with that though sorry yeah

672
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,880
the problem with that is that the kind

673
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,159
of companies that leonard's talking

674
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,520
about i don't have a governor

675
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,520
so it's about

676
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,600
it's about a broader visibility within

677
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,520
the organization maybe even outside of

678
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,799
security yeah in your it team even doing

679
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,360
your mainstream u365 stuff we have a

680
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,159
thing it's called security.text and it

681
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,039
points signposts researchers

682
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,880
tell us about a problem that they found

683
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,799
so it doesn't matter

684
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,039
who owns it the information can still

685
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,480
find somebody within the organization

686
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,320
the fact that they can't fix it but they

687
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,880
can go find somebody to fix it that then

688
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,840
it works so reasonably well top tip

689
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,200
if you're going to put an email address

690
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,720
in your security

691
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,120
dot txt make it the edius so it's not

692
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,960
assigned to an individual so if that

693
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,280
individual leaves you just simply change

694
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,120
that whoever's in that group in that

695
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,559
email yeah i find sales at company is a

696
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,039
good one

697
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,039
but you end up in the situation if you

698
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,120
if you do end up sending it to sales out

699
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,840
or info or contact you end up in the

700
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,280
was it cathy cathy or kate t-mobile

701
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,440
australia yeah yeah or my infamous about

702
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,679
with bt don't change your dns or it will

703
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:36,720
explode

704
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,039
what they can use in that case is their

705
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,919
dpo because of gdpr a lot of

706
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,919
companies do advertise a privacy policy

707
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,000
and a dpo email address and you might

708
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,520
find someone

709
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,039
it shouldn't be their problem because

710
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,320
the whole privacy thing should be their

711
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,480
thing but they might actually remotely

712
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,320
care about security

713
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,080
yeah they'll actually give a so

714
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,919
possibly especially if there's sensitive

715
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,080
data behind that website oh yeah yeah

716
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,760
then they're gonna give a

717
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,720
you shouldn't you shouldn't be pressing

718
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,880
f12

719
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,080
got more questions

720
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,840
yeah we've got a couple more sorry i

721
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,360
said right had a second question then

722
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,080
just talk for 20 minutes um which

723
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,840
is basically every single time we get on

724
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,440
a call um

725
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,400
but yeah

726
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,640
yeah this is true confirmed by leonard

727
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,640
um so second question from rag is what's

728
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,000
your stance on disclosures to

729
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,360
organizations that don't have a

730
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,880
dedicated vdp cdp bbp

731
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,559
llc

732
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,840
but the issue discovered was still

733
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,640
critical so

734
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,080
my stance on this is

735
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,080
generally don't try it sectorals that

736
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,960
don't have any of these um policies but

737
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,000
if you are buying shoes and you find

738
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,919
something then you know you're not

739
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,240
actively searching it you found it and

740
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,039
might as well report it

741
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,960
so yeah i would absolutely try to

742
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,760
disclose to them but

743
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,440
if they're not responding and something

744
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,840
like okay you don't want to be secure

745
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,840
i don't care

746
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,640
anymore

747
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,600
oh fair enough i we've got two of our

748
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,919
speakers from earlier i

749
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,320
well i say earlier i meant yesterday

750
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,480
i asking us a few questions so we've got

751
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,039
one from bushido which what is what do

752
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,559
you think of poc friday

753
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,760
because it makes work weekends

754
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,520
don't do it don't drop your friends on

755
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,840
friday

756
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,320
no poc friday 6 pm and then go at the

757
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,679
pub yes and just watch the notifications

758
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,520
explode

759
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,200
it's it's more fun because you can watch

760
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,960
it from the pub or or before a bank

761
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,880
holiday weekend yeah i don't watch

762
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,000
football so you know put the

763
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,240
notifications on you know screen share

764
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,840
screencast or something to the big tv in

765
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,440
the pub and just

766
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,880
that's more fun

767
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,919
um

768
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,440
hill nolly actually asked a good

769
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,240
question how do you feel the idea that a

770
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,799
security researcher may not know all of

771
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,880
the unintended consequences

772
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,039
of releasing a zero day

773
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:01,440
um to an unresponsive vendor as well

774
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,240
yeah you won't that's

775
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,480
how it works but what other options do

776
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,200
you have

777
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,520
no it's

778
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,918
very nice

779
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,039
yeah

780
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,960
if you don't disclose the zero day

781
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,480
lenses on a sailor which is not really

782
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,600
an option either so yeah i think that

783
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,279
you will have to disclose and you just

784
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,480
kind of have to accept that you don't

785
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,400
know everything

786
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,799
i think the bigger risk is in one

787
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,480
offender is non-responsive and you're

788
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,720
gonna drop it at some point because

789
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,200
you're trying to pressure them and

790
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,600
that's the point where yes you might not

791
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,679
have an idea which organizations use

792
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,600
their software or how critical it is et

793
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,760
cetera et cetera which is why with david

794
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,679
a if we run into a very unresponsive

795
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,000
vendor we'll still try to scan the

796
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,919
internet for who are using the product

797
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,000
and inform the users just hey you know

798
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,320
this product is insecure

799
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,159
take it offline put it behind the vpn

800
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,840
firewall it off do something

801
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,840
yeah no that makes sense do you want to

802
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,840
quickly drop your uh screen share so we

803
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,279
can actually see your pretty face open

804
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,559
this version

805
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,799
very pretty screen

806
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:16,159
perfect gorgeous absolutely gorgeous um

807
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,520
yeah we've

808
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,399
basically that's pretty much us um

809
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,159
john i know you're you're in the
