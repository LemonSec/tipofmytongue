1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,159
so uh yeah good afternoon everybody this

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:05,200
is my talk info sex sucks and it's not

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,560
because of the people

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,240
odd thing to say obviously the first

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,280
thing i want to get out of the railway

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,960
real quick is a big thank you to the

7
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,040
beer farmers putting on the conference

8
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,040
and having me on in all of my green horn

9
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,199
glory and i'm coming at you live from

10
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,279
the deck of la serena if you watch star

11
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:20,960
trek

12
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,400
so obviously everybody started their

13
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,400
slides in the same way i'm no different

14
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,640
so we're going about the author section

15
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,880
now i haven't done a presentation for

16
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,119
about 15 years or so since i was at

17
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,120
university so i've been i've reached

18
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,040
deep in the the back of my mind and i've

19
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,559
pulled out all my tricks for stretching

20
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,040
out a half an hour conference

21
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:39,840
so

22
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,520
we start with what's your name

23
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,760
and what's your daddy do

24
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,760
it's glorious it's glorious honestly

25
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,480
though

26
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,440
that's it from me mostly jokes aside so

27
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,719
my name is dan

28
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,879
i go by the handle of hacks on pretty

29
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,960
much everything yes i know that's not

30
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,199
hacks in leetspeak it's hex the point

31
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,640
when i was 20 years old and making up

32
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,159
the names so

33
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,799
you know is what it is i started hacking

34
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,560
a very early age probably before junior

35
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,880
school to be honest but uh

36
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,479
it was back in the like probably was

37
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,920
before junior school now think about it

38
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,080
because i used my dad's

39
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,880
very expensive sony hi-fi which had play

40
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,960
and play records so i could do commodore

41
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,640
64 games

42
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,840
so that was an interesting time for me

43
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,720
also i once accidentally on purpose

44
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,799
opened up my sister's ghetto blaster uh

45
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,159
just to see what it did i was i was

46
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,840
curious to electronically to take stuff

47
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,840
apart i opened up a ghetto blaster and

48
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,840
snipped all the wires and then i taped

49
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,759
them back up with sellotape and

50
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,240
surprisingly it still worked so no one

51
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,759
was the wiser i'm not too worried about

52
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,280
it anyway

53
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,479
currently i wreck in the top 1 of

54
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,320
hackers on try hack me if you do the

55
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,640
math it's actually 0.2

56
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,520
so

57
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,240
pretty pretty good pretty good and i'm

58
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,399
pretty much a newbie on hack the box as

59
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,960
well ctfs are my jam uh i've got 11

60
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,600
roots and 11 users so

61
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
you know whatever

62
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,920
been in it for a very long time started

63
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,520
answering phones on a help desk worked

64
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,038
my way up self-taught all the

65
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,160
departments because there's nothing else

66
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,599
to do at the time

67
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,480
and my starting security actually i got

68
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,160
it in networking but not the traditional

69
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,959
handy-shaky meeting people networking my

70
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,520
start was finding people like network

71
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,520
chuck on youtube a lot of the content

72
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,920
that i got was from youtube and reading

73
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,760
things and watching things

74
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,000
so that's how i got started and since

75
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,840
everyone throws in a funny little tidbit

76
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,840
about themselves in these kind of things

77
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,840
my fun little tidbit is not long walks

78
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,319
on the beach my tidbit is i once hand

79
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,560
drew a qr code that worked

80
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,360
and it cost me my job

81
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,360
more on that later though so quickly

82
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,800
over now what we're going to discuss

83
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,120
we're going to talk about life as a noob

84
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,040
the learning curve that you get from

85
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,760
that

86
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,519
finding your own way around and finding

87
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,360
what works for you and then we get onto

88
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,599
the more interesting stuff there's hr

89
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,680
gatekeeping that's going on

90
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,800
uh how to fix recruitment or entirely

91
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,959
how to bypass hr that's another way of

92
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,360
looking at it and the grand importance

93
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,360
of networking so

94
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,200
let's get rolling so

95
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,200
life as a noob

96
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,680
i'm scared ask me anything

97
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,280
so we've all been there

98
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,760
everyone starts as a noob and uh for me

99
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,400
it started with messing with my friends

100
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,920
at the time i was learning things off

101
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,400
the internet i was reading lots of blogs

102
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,120
uh i discovered edward kim's blog he

103
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,920
goes by the handle cranklin and

104
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,799
he had

105
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,640
interesting posts on making arduino

106
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,599
powered uh fish feeders and using home

107
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,440
automation to make his own jarvis and

108
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,280
things like that way before

109
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,040
home kit and things like that came out

110
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,799
he was using arduinos and raspberry pi's

111
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,239
and all this stuff the other it really

112
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,360
got me in the tinkering mindset but my

113
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,159
tinkering was messing with my friends so

114
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,040
i would remove the ball from the mouse

115
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,599
back 3000 years ago when i was younger

116
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,200
used to have mice with balls and you

117
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,799
turn them and if you needed a new ball

118
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,640
you had to hard boil an egg and put a

119
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,720
new one in and then it went onto putting

120
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,439
tape in the lasers

121
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,360
and also replacing wallpapers with blue

122
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,480
screens of death taking away icons

123
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,320
it was windows 7 so we used to replace

124
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,238
the boot screen with a blue screen of

125
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,680
death as well

126
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,960
we we were we were funny kids

127
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,040
so once you've uh moved past from

128
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,800
messing with friends you need to ask

129
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,639
yourself where to start

130
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,560
and then usually ask google

131
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,240
you know or don't go whatever browser

132
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,520
you want to use

133
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,520
you find random things in my case i was

134
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,120
finding random workarounds and

135
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,639
code and things like that on stack

136
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,280
overflow and random websites they helped

137
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,800
me in my job they actually helped me

138
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,440
with coding and making uh buttons for

139
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,280
tickets and things so

140
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,360
when people were logging calls the call

141
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,800
handling time went down because they

142
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,919
didn't have to go digging through their

143
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,960
notes to to raise a ticket for like um

144
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,320
broadband connection being down or

145
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,440
something like that just press the

146
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,600
button all the information's there ask

147
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,120
the right questions send it to the next

148
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,479
department

149
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,080
i was really good at that

150
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,120
so

151
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,440
moving on from that blogging vlogging

152
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,680
was something that i have done um i

153
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,759
think it's something everybody at one

154
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,360
time or another has done blogging

155
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,039
writing down your thoughts

156
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,600
dark poems you know things like that and

157
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,479
uh yeah quite a few i t things i was

158
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,000
more reading them though i still can't

159
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,240
blog properly now that might just be me

160
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,160
i don't know but

161
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,759
anyway

162
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,880
other questions that you can ask

163
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,039
yourself as a noob should i make a

164
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,720
linkedin i mean it's basically

165
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,639
professional facebook isn't it or it's

166
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,800
paid for posting depend upon which

167
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,720
way you look at it

168
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,000
um i can't say linkedin has done

169
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,240
too much for me personally i have got a

170
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,479
lot of bots wanting me so that's quite

171
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,120
nice but other than that

172
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,199
it depends your mileage may vary i can't

173
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,639
speak for you guys i can only speak for

174
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,240
myself

175
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,039
now

176
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,840
back when i was a real noob i debated

177
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,319
actually asking for help and mentoring

178
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,240
it's

179
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,080
it was it was very nerve-wracking from

180
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,000
my point of view being a complete noob

181
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,680
and not knowing anyone not knowing who

182
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,360
to follow what questions to ask so i

183
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,199
think it kind of dissuaded me from

184
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,520
asking for mentorship from people i

185
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,280
thought if i can learn it myself that's

186
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,720
probably going to look better in the

187
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,639
long run so that's the way i kind of

188
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,720
approached it and why it's taken me so

189
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,960
long to do this it might be a joke i'm

190
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,240
not sure we'll see what happens in a few

191
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,919
years time

192
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,440
also um

193
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,680
watching videos you know it's what

194
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,560
you're going to do as a noob you're

195
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,680
going to be reading blogs you're going

196
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,440
to be watching videos you're just

197
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,400
absorbing content like a sponge and

198
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,080
interesting actually leads me on to the

199
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,160
next slide which is learning curve

200
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,560
so uh i've got a quote there it's 100

201
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,080
from the star trek movie you don't have

202
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,919
to go and watch it it says getting into

203
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,759
cyber is like shooting a bullet with a

204
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,840
smaller bullet whilst blindfolded and

205
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,280
riding a horse

206
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,960
totally in the mover definitely didn't

207
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,479
change anything

208
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,039
but to be fair it is a steep ladder to

209
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,960
go up the learning curve because if

210
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,319
you're not computer inclined or if

211
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,000
you're not working in a computing job

212
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,599
you're really not not going to know what

213
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,919
to do you're going to be googling random

214
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,240
things or looking into things what could

215
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,000
i be learning

216
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,960
you know

217
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,680
for

218
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,680
me i was lucky that i got into computing

219
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,520
my dad was a pen and paper kind of guy

220
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,039
he was a salesman

221
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,400
it probably would hate me being with

222
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,000
computers but

223
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,080
alas it's okay

224
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,400
so way back when when england locked up

225
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,080
tight when the pandemic happened just

226
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,360
over well

227
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,639
aren't going but just over a year and a

228
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,400
bit ago when england locked up tight i

229
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,000
found myself in an abundance to free

230
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,120
time

231
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,960
and that's what happened i had a fire

232
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,240
lit under me for learning i was like

233
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,680
well there's two ways to come out the

234
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,440
pandemic i can either make something of

235
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,680
myself or i can be really lazy so i

236
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,039
thought i'll make something of myself

237
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,520
i'm gonna i'm gonna try and make

238
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,160
something of myself so

239
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,879
how to approach a big problem well i

240
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,960
wanted in on the cyber security industry

241
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,520
and i had to step back and see what that

242
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,639
looks like

243
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:59,680
so

244
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,759
it's usually you to use an analogy i did

245
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,080
some gardening recently and just like if

246
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,160
you want to chop down a big tree

247
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,680
you can pick one out and you want to cut

248
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,280
that big one down

249
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,199
but then you start hacking away into

250
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,960
smaller pieces and i want to put it to

251
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,319
use so free free resources really helped

252
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,680
me so

253
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,319
again books blogs talks youtube

254
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,720
find what works for you

255
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,440
not me you pressed you referring to me

256
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,879
et cetera you know that i'm sure you do

257
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,958
so finding your groove now that you've

258
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,640
picked that good looking cyber tree with

259
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,958
no bird nests plenty of branches to turn

260
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,760
into you're learning firewood

261
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,200
chopped it down what are you gonna do

262
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,958
with it so like i said you chop it up

263
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,040
into smaller pieces and burn them

264
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,880
chopping can mean many things on your

265
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,560
path so

266
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,000
find a good branch so in my case

267
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,560
when i started looking at things

268
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,800
i looked into red teaming there's way

269
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,959
more to it than red teaming just on its

270
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,160
own though i know this is probably

271
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,839
contrary to other people still be like

272
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,839
oh they're bluetooth or purple team or

273
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,519
yellow team guess what different

274
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,399
branches same tree it's all cyber so red

275
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,160
team is split off into physical

276
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,720
engagements pen testing and then they'd

277
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,240
go into two things and two and four and

278
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,600
six and eight sort of thing it does

279
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,680
spread out it all comes back to mother

280
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,880
tree or whatever the case may be

281
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,120
so the thing that happened for me the

282
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,040
thing that got me the most laughs and

283
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,200
the thing that i enjoyed the most was uh

284
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,160
defcon talks from jason uh jason e

285
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,040
street who was talking about his uh

286
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,040
uh which talk was i think it's i'm

287
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,959
walking through a city made of glass and

288
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,120
all i have is a big bag full of rocks

289
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,279
that got me thinking about how to get

290
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,320
into

291
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,320
security what i want to do and then i

292
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,399
saw the film sneakers and right away the

293
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,080
beginning of the movies explained that

294
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,080
oh you get talking to the cashier you

295
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,920
get paid to break into places and tell

296
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,519
them how well their security is and then

297
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,800
he walks off with 10 grand and just

298
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,600
hands it to the bank manager

299
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,200
so that got me going and you can't

300
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,600
forget jason's talk steal everything

301
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,519
kill everyone and cause total financial

302
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,640
report that one that was amazing that

303
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,680
talk

304
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,519
jason street is an amazing man for that

305
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,959
talk and for everything that he does

306
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,480
obviously

307
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,079
so

308
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,399
sly's just messing up sorry gamification

309
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,399
came along so

310
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,079
when the xbox came out i worked at

311
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,000
curries i worked at their game section i

312
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,320
was selling xboxes and i saw the xbox

313
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,079
come out and i was like oh this is the

314
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,680
this isn't the playstation i've got home

315
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,120
this is something new

316
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,800
and then achievements came along you

317
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,079
could earn achievements although that

318
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,240
was the xbox 360 but don't worry about

319
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,040
it

320
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,360
but yeah the the gamification side the

321
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,600
getting completions and taking things

322
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,920
down that ticked something in my brain

323
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,360
that i needed so i kept pushing on that

324
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,680
and one of the most common things i was

325
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,519
known for back in the day was capture

326
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,200
the flag i would go to anyone i'd come

327
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,880
on the xbox and everybody'd want to play

328
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,959
some halo why wouldn't i

329
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,399
so

330
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,120
that gamification it made me develop my

331
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,040
skills in the real world when i

332
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,360
discovered things in my case from

333
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,519
finding my groove

334
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,640
try hack me and hack the box there are

335
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,800
many other places there's volume hub

336
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,120
there's tons of resources out there too

337
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,600
many i can't list because honestly i

338
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,839
can't remember them all does that matter

339
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,760
so that's how i got my start

340
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,839
ctfs i love ctfs i love racking my brain

341
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,760
for days i love getting it on the first

342
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,519
try or wrecking my brain there's there's

343
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,600
two ways about it

344
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,519
i found try hack me better because it

345
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,079
taught me penetration testing it taught

346
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:34,880
me

347
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,200
networking it taught me

348
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,720
basically everything you can never go

349
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,920
over the basics too much so i really

350
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,839
enjoyed that and then hacked the box was

351
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,839
the personal playground where i just

352
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,360
go into it and try and get something

353
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,959
done

354
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,079
so

355
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,760
the thing with hack the box and things

356
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,360
like you have streaks so i found a way

357
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,360
of holding myself accountable

358
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,519
making sure that i could

359
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,680
maintain a streak of completing at least

360
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,839
one thing every day or

361
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,360
going through and smashing a box every

362
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,880
day whatever the case may be that's why

363
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,720
my activity was really clumped for one

364
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,560
moment and there's nothing for months

365
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,480
because i had nothing else to do at that

366
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,560
time and i've started to pick it back up

367
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,760
now

368
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,079
the other thing that led from that is

369
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,959
helping others i i want to be better at

370
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,399
helping others

371
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,360
and i want to be a better note taker so

372
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,920
those two things put together would help

373
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,079
people taking better notes

374
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,680
you know explaining my actions my

375
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,320
thought processes things like that i can

376
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,839
funnel that into

377
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,560
a write-up for a ctf and somebody might

378
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,760
get some help with that somebody might

379
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,040
be stuck so

380
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,320
i'm trying to be better at that i'm not

381
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,000
saying i'm the best i'm terrible at

382
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,839
taking notes i used to have the brain

383
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,440
where i could see something and i'd

384
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,720
remember it but as i'm getting older

385
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,680
it's like steel traps getting rusty

386
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,200
i can't remember

387
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,079
my missus hates me for it

388
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,120
and uh yeah furthering my skills that is

389
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,560
the thing that i've been focusing most

390
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,079
on i've been trying to get better at

391
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,480
things i've been doing as much i consume

392
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,760
training like you wouldn't believe i

393
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,720
think

394
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,880
you have to be an eternal learner to

395
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,279
work in cyber security you can't just

396
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,000
like

397
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,480
get your cissp and that be the end of it

398
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,560
because something always changes and

399
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,079
something new always comes out something

400
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,639
that's better shiny more black i don't

401
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,519
know you know things like that

402
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,360
but that also brings me onto something

403
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,160
else it brings me to our section on hey

404
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,760
gatekeeping

405
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,800
now

406
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,560
this has bothered me for a little while

407
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,839
i've noticed it

408
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,800
for a good few years now but since i've

409
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,240
started to focus more into cyber

410
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,680
security obviously it's a little a

411
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,360
little bit easier to see it because

412
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,199
there's a lot more of it going on

413
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,279
it's not something new it's it's been

414
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,760
around since jobs were a thing sort of

415
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,639
thing

416
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,600
but uh yeah it's more prevalent in

417
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,680
cyber security than anything else

418
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,160
so we've all seen posts and on

419
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,839
lippington like

420
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,959
do this job or do that job or check out

421
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,199
this stupid requirement on this job sort

422
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,600
of thing and they get mixed results now

423
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,399
i'm not saying that it's a necessarily a

424
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,360
hr problem i think maybe it's an

425
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,040
industry problem

426
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,839
now

427
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,360
i can see you now set back in your

428
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,480
chairs even though i'm looking at the

429
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,040
laptop i can see you thinking what do

430
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,360
you mean it's an industry problem well

431
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,680
have you ever really sat back and

432
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,800
objectively looked at our industry

433
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,760
cyber security certification training

434
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,519
is kind of a money pit

435
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,199
and this is coming from me who doesn't

436
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,519
have any money i'm living on the dole as

437
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,120
the case would be

438
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,240
but

439
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,399
you see these job listings and it's okay

440
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,560
well the money pit theory so you go to

441
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,720
uni you get your master's degree you go

442
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,959
into debt for the masters but you know

443
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,399
the idea is you get a job and you pay it

444
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,120
back but you need five years experience

445
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,199
you also need cisp and a ceh an ostp or

446
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,880
crest certification just ignore any

447
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,480
scandals

448
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,519
uh cves two publish cvs they'd be handy

449
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,000
all for an entry level job that's barely

450
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,920
paying enough to warrant actually having

451
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,000
a job each month where you could earn

452
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,120
just as much money being on the dole

453
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,240
it it hurts it really does hurt

454
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,279
so

455
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,519
enough enough on that one

456
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,560
why has this happened why has

457
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,040
training testing renewals

458
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,279
role specific certifications why has it

459
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,880
happened it's all bleeding back into

460
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,079
that money pit

461
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:28,959
now

462
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,880
it reminds me of watching a video the

463
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,320
other day because you know i watch

464
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,160
videos that's my thing i was watching

465
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,720
the haunted hacker podcast not to plug

466
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,920
another podcast or anything i don't know

467
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,480
how people feel about that but i was re

468
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,480
i was hearing mike jones and chris

469
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,199
roberts talking about this they're both

470
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,279
good guys in my opinion you know people

471
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,720
have their own opinions opinions like

472
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,759
nipples everybody has one you know

473
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,079
it's no it's no skin from me sort of

474
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,319
thing

475
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,120
don't know what happened there

476
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,680
my laptop just decided to skip a section

477
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,519
don't worry about it uh yeah they were

478
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,399
talking about the money pit and that

479
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,440
it goes in and hr managers and things

480
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,600
like that then they might not be the big

481
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,360
problem it might be that it goes both

482
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,880
ways in the industry that's making us

483
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,560
jump through these hoops to get our name

484
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,079
on a piece of paper

485
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,000
that could be the problem maybe that's

486
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,839
where the weakness is because one side

487
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,079
doesn't know what the other side's doing

488
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,240
now misunderstanding of certifications

489
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,839
on the entry level

490
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,160
yes that we see that so much because

491
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,959
again i think it was a hr problem

492
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,120
but yeah it's jumping through hoops it's

493
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,800
having to get a cissp to do a job where

494
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,399
you're answering phones all day sort of

495
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,120
thing the people hiring managers or

496
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,759
teams are hearing these buzzwords

497
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,279
thinking oh we need we need extra

498
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,880
buzzwords let's get a c h let's get this

499
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,399
and they're not realizing that some of

500
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,800
these things don't tie into what they're

501
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,639
looking for you're looking for a pen

502
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,320
tester you want somebody's got a pen

503
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,399
testing certification and you want

504
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,839
somebody who's good at report writing

505
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,760
because let's face it pretty much

506
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,039
everything's report right and there's no

507
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,799
getting around it i hate paperwork but

508
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,079
i'm gonna have to get used to doing it

509
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,480
that's what i want to do

510
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,000
so

511
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,760
it leads to

512
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,880
certifications getting snubbed by people

513
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,119
so it's like oh you've got you've got

514
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,480
ceh

515
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,480
sorry about that because let's not

516
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,119
forget if you read the news or if you

517
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,559
keep an eye on infosec twitter and

518
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,160
things like that there's been a lot of

519
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,840
scandals and a lot of issues and fiascos

520
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,600
just to use lighter words because it's a

521
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,600
much deeper thing than i want to go into

522
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,679
because i don't fully understand it

523
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,520
but yeah it's been it's been pretty

524
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,400
rough on people maybe again

525
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,640
the industry needs to objectively look

526
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,840
at how things are worded and

527
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,160
communicated or maybe hr needs to listen

528
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,080
and ask the right questions maybe that's

529
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,440
the key

530
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,600
but anyway check out these following

531
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,880
slides

532
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,880
it's actually posted on my linkedin um

533
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,280
so i'm not too fussed about it

534
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,919
so these this is what job hunting looks

535
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,840
like uh on linkedin that i've noticed so

536
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,200
i don't know if most people can see this

537
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,360
so i'll just give it a swift note it's a

538
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,960
quick little clip

539
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,880
so you've got required skills you must

540
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,559
be fluent in every programming language

541
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:17,840
every programming language

542
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,760
ones that don't exist work history in 99

543
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,080
years every tech certification work for

544
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,640
nasa etc stupid things people are

545
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,000
looking for

546
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,679
it doesn't work it doesn't get people

547
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,679
clicking it doesn't get people applying

548
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,200
and then on the other hand you've got

549
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,039
i can't even see my own certification

550
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,280
that was uh me asking

551
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,520
what certification helped get you into

552
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,520
the field so you've got 500 quid what

553
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,720
would you spend it on how would you

554
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,840
spend it only one person actually gave a

555
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,160
constructive answer that would help

556
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,440
other people

557
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,840
everyone else was just tick a button or

558
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,760
like or share there's nothing wrong with

559
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,480
that

560
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,919
but it doesn't contribute it doesn't

561
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,039
help

562
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:57,919
so

563
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,760
what it feels like sometimes when you're

564
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,679
looking at certifications

565
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,120
it feels like the joker standing in

566
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,360
front of a big pile of money and burning

567
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,679
it all because that's just the way it is

568
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:08,880
you have to spend thousands upon

569
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,919
thousands of pounds to get these

570
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,880
certifications it's just not helping

571
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,480
this for example

572
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,080
this is my favorite post because the

573
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,840
only person who took note of what was

574
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,840
actually written was a guy called chris

575
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,720
humphries uh sargonsek on twitter he's

576
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,480
awesome go follow him

577
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,200
so

578
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,799
clearly we know there's a

579
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,640
misunderstanding or a misinformation

580
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,960
thing happening here and people seem to

581
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,559
understand that asking for certain hoops

582
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:33,919
to be jumped through isn't the way

583
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,919
forward but they aren't doing much about

584
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,679
it so

585
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:38,960
again you can get the skills you need

586
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,559
without these expensive certifications

587
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,000
so why isn't that being picked up on

588
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,039
more

589
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,400
so

590
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,000
i wanted this text heavy slide to appear

591
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,360
but i'm just going to quickly glance

592
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,039
over it because i might run out of time

593
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,679
sort of thing so the ceh only kicks

594
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,840
around because of the military needing

595
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,000
the iso certification

596
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
again that fiasco that happened a lot of

597
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,159
people let their certs expire due to the

598
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,840
fiasco

599
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,000
also did you know that the ceh site

600
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,600
clearly states that you need two years

601
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,520
experiencing a cyber job to do the

602
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,440
self-study course which is what i was

603
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,679
planning on doing eventually but

604
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,280
i can't afford it

605
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,720
the other option is to attend their

606
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,039
formal training which costs a ton of

607
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,840
money which you don't have

608
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,520
but you need it to get into an interview

609
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,679
in the first place

610
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,480
not quite what we're looking for there

611
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,799
sans originally this is from googling

612
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,080
and watching stuff and read this stuff

613
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,000
it could be wrong but sans initially had

614
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,640
donald dick on the on the training on

615
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,320
the testing slides and things like that

616
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,799
that's hilarious but that's dated i

617
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:41,919
don't know if it's still a thing i don't

618
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,919
have thousands of pounds to spend

619
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,280
we'll go with that

620
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,559
and then yeah a certain company made the

621
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,720
papers for the crest certification

622
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,039
scandal um the answers are still on

623
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,039
github so it cheapens it for everyone

624
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,880
else who's actually putting in the work

625
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,480
and putting in the effort to get these

626
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,640
certifications it just

627
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,840
makes it not worth the paper it's

628
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,200
written on

629
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,559
read the news

630
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,200
learn about it keep going so moving

631
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,200
swiftly along we have got fixing

632
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,559
recruiting

633
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,480
uh i had to put the simpsons quote in

634
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,840
and just edit it slightly because it

635
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,840
made me

636
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,039
but

637
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,720
way to fix recruiting speak to a

638
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,520
third-party consultancy for entry level

639
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,480
or buzzwords certain things to look for

640
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,559
not to tip the tip your hand sort of

641
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,960
thing but just get help

642
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,039
that would help recruiting getting out

643
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,559
without recruiting

644
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,559
understand the candidate may not fit in

645
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,679
so blue hair tattoos piercings it's

646
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,600
normal now you don't have to worry about

647
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,799
what people look like if they're

648
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,400
qualified to do the job they are

649
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,400
qualified to do the job if they've got

650
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,400
desire and drive and they're burning hot

651
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,240
and learn like a sponge

652
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,919
get them in they know what they're doing

653
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:50,720
they're going to learn they're going to

654
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,240
impress you they're going to be want to

655
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,679
be that person that you want there in a

656
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,840
year's time sort of thing

657
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,280
one thing to know i

658
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,960
realize the obvious

659
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,559
zero to two years experience is the

660
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,039
sweet spot for an entry level job

661
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,840
not five years experience that is kind

662
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,520
of pushing the boat out a little bit too

663
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,640
far

664
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,919
also things like fight uh ceh2 oscars

665
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,080
and an emmy not on doesn't work don't

666
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,159
put it in there it's stupid if you copy

667
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,080
paste and just delete that bit

668
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,440
and then also

669
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,720
something you could look into for

670
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,480
certifications that people already have

671
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,919
people who've invested their time and

672
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,520
their money and their patience and their

673
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,559
learning

674
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,400
put it in a desirable law would be

675
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,480
really cool if you had because then you

676
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,159
can look at paying them

677
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,280
extra

678
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,080
maybe you know give them a bonus you

679
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,559
know see uh oscp for a pen test is what

680
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,559
800 and

681
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:41,440
quid

682
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,960
if you do the conversion from dollars to

683
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,200
pounds so why not give them a grand

684
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,360
bonus for the year

685
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,880
that would get people's attention that

686
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,720
would get people wanting to work the

687
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,039
people want the work let people have the

688
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,640
work

689
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,039
now fun things that you can do you can

690
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,960
bypass hr

691
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,919
sort of i wouldn't recommend it but

692
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,520
some things that you can do you can try

693
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,320
to so sh oh wait i left that in sir

694
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,480
you can try to friend the recruitment

695
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,640
team so you can reach out to people the

696
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,919
fun thing about linkedin being the

697
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,240
professional network that it is is you

698
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,679
can talk to recruiters directly you

699
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,200
could say hey i've seen you reply you've

700
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,799
got this job i want to apply for it but

701
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,240
i've not got this what do you think

702
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,720
what's my chances would that work

703
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,880
yeah it works i've spoke to recruiters

704
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,799
recruiters are cool people actually

705
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,320
you'd be surprised

706
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,679
now you might have a blog maybe it's in

707
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,000
limbo like mine is at the moment but use

708
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,840
it make it sparkle make it shine you

709
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,520
know that can help that can show that

710
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,080
you can do things outside of

711
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,600
the workplace that you're learning

712
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,039
you've got drive you've got fire and

713
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,320
passion

714
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,360
github

715
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,200
i love github i used to hate github now

716
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,200
i love it it's actually really good but

717
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,520
fully commented github history

718
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,799
especially when you f up i have got some

719
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,200
prime examples of me effing up on things

720
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,679
or putting in commits that are like

721
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,440
a or hands hands hands hands hands

722
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,200
because i'm trying to get something out

723
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,960
show that you've done your badges and

724
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,799
your rewards things like that i'm not

725
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,120
saying pollute linkedin because

726
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,320
something else that i've seen on

727
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,320
linkedin is everybody shares their

728
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,039
badges now it's cool don't get me wrong

729
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,039
sharing your badges is awesome but it

730
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,080
has a it has a downside as well you're

731
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,600
polluting and filling up somebody else's

732
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,039
timeline with things that they may never

733
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:25,840
get

734
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,600
kind of sucks put them on a blog that's

735
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,120
what i'm planning on doing stick them on

736
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,480
a blog

737
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,320
now you can build a community or you can

738
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,320
join a discord you can contribute you

739
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,400
can make it count you can pass on

740
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,080
knowledge because

741
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,919
ultimately we're not getting out of this

742
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,320
alive so pass on the knowledge and help

743
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,960
other people people are important people

744
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,640
of the future

745
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,799
youtube for example

746
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,039
if you are good at something i'm not

747
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,240
saying the joker thing if you're good at

748
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,080
something never do it for free but what

749
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,520
i'm saying is if you can show what

750
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,799
you're talking about and you know what

751
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,000
you're talking about and you can show

752
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,840
you have an audience you can leverage

753
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,320
that audience not saying you could sell

754
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,880
them a raid shadow legend subscription

755
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,799
or anything like that but you could say

756
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,320
hey i've got a thousand people that tune

757
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,039
in regularly to see me talk about

758
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,640
tech you know

759
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,880
and then speaking of that contribute

760
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,760
share

761
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,840
sharing is caring after all which brings

762
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,360
us on to networking networking

763
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,000
is key it's key in the world i was never

764
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,640
much of a social butterfly um at school

765
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,559
or at work or anything like that i never

766
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,000
went out for beers

767
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,480
i stayed in and played games or i stayed

768
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,360
in and

769
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,000
hacked computers or broke computers or

770
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,039
took about hard drives using coasters

771
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,880
so thanks to the internet and the

772
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,640
amazing series of tubes that it is i've

773
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,880
met some of the most lovely

774
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,440
fun promising influential people in the

775
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,279
business sure they might not know what i

776
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,120
look like and sure i might just be an

777
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,200
avatar on the internet sort of thing but

778
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,720
it's a it's a weird connection you can

779
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,720
have with somebody to feel like that

780
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,000
you've met them and you know them and

781
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,760
they're cool and if you needed help they

782
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,039
could help you move your couch if you

783
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,039
move in house you know those are the

784
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,039
kind of people that you need

785
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,600
now everyone starts somewhere so you

786
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,120
know dip your toe in

787
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,159
see how you're getting on you're not

788
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,159
going to walk 500 miles and then you're

789
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:13,840
not going to walk 500 more if you don't

790
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,760
put one foot in front of the other and

791
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,039
start going

792
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,640
interestingly enough the first

793
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,799
interaction that i had with scott was

794
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,640
this tweet

795
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,919
it was actually a meme that i made for

796
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:26,240
somebody else a very long time ago but

797
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,520
it made me think of scott because he was

798
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,120
always complaining about leaf blowers

799
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,679
not to bring that up i'm sure it's a

800
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,480
topic sort of thing but that was my

801
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,400
first interaction with scott which then

802
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,240
bit me in the ass a few days later when

803
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,000
somebody was out that's actually a video

804
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,400
but it don't play um of doing leaf

805
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,520
blowers up and down the street there's

806
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,960
actually somebody earlier with the

807
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,640
grassrooms as well

808
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,799
so i just can't escape them i'm like

809
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:49,840
scott

810
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,520
and uh look at me now i'm on the

811
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,320
internet i'm doing something new

812
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,200
so

813
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,760
more networking now

814
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,919
this is important because the first

815
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,760
impression can be important but it

816
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,360
doesn't mean something like wearing a

817
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,000
suit to your sister's newborn baby for

818
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,480
now getting to know people it helps get

819
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,080
your name out there it makes people say

820
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,159
oh that was the thing that dan did not

821
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,240
the qr code

822
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,799
i'll tell you about the qr code later

823
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,320
but yeah it gets your name out there it

824
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,520
makes recruiters remember it makes

825
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,960
people remember it's very important

826
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,720
you've only got one name unless you have

827
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,320
multiple names don't worry about it but

828
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,399
for now connecting and sharing really

829
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,120
cool social media can work for you not

830
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,279
just as an aussie tool um i've got

831
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,559
twitter i've got an instagram i've got a

832
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:33,520
tick

833
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,120
docs thyself

834
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,720
i try to frame it around the things that

835
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,039
i do or the things that i'm proud of and

836
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,559
i want to show off

837
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,640
also posting can't forget about

838
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,000
that

839
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,039
now a quote that i like is growing is

840
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,000
when you do something you're not

841
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,080
entirely comfortable with i'm working it

842
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:50,880
out

843
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,159
it might have been gandhi who said that

844
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:53,600
i don't know that's that's why i've put

845
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,080
candy probably to be honest i never

846
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,840
would have thought a year and a bit ago

847
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,320
when i really started to dig my

848
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,720
uh dig my teeth into cyber security

849
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,080
i would have thought of signing up as a

850
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,320
speaker at a conference this probably

851
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,520
never would have happened if i didn't

852
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,760
reach out and start doing something

853
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,960
at least it's not in front of people

854
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,159
i've heard if you're doing a conference

855
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:13,360
in front of people you have to imagine

856
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,880
the audience naked but i don't know how

857
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,120
that works on the internet so

858
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,520
webcam you're naked

859
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,799
um yeah it's it's not something i would

860
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,120
have dreamed possible so throw yourself

861
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,520
at a conference as a speaker see how it

862
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,279
goes

863
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,600
now wrapping up to nearly at the end now

864
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,600
uh this is the downer unfortunately

865
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,120
because there is a downside to

866
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,320
networking

867
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,320
difficulty knowing who to follow i've

868
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,039
always operated on a try before you buy

869
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,720
thing so say you want to follow to

870
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,640
people follow 10 people pick those

871
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,799
people and stick with them for a week

872
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,520
if they're good keep them if they're not

873
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,200
it's no harm just to block people and

874
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,640
mute people you know there's nothing

875
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,799
wrong with that the other downside is

876
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,559
there's a lot of disinformation out

877
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,120
there this has become really relevant

878
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,679
really recently so i'll put a disclaimer

879
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,840
at the bottom of this slide

880
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,679
it can do it can be daunting to us noobs

881
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:06,960
because we follow the wrong people or we

882
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,640
learn the wrong things we say the wrong

883
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,760
things and it gets us in a lot of

884
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,480
trouble so you've got to keep your head

885
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,919
on a swivel

886
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,240
if you can't phone a friend sanity check

887
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,320
if you know somebody in the biz or if

888
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,000
you have a friend who's into it check

889
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,919
with them see what they think bounce it

890
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:24,240
off their noggin and when in doubt

891
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,480
trust swift on security oops yeah trust

892
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,120
swift on security computers butts and

893
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,159
also multi platinum records and uh yeah

894
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,880
the disclaimer this cyber security

895
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,240
awareness month has been the most busy

896
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,080

897
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,520

we've had f12 hacking ios zero days rcas

899
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,000
that rc is even madness

900
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,880
