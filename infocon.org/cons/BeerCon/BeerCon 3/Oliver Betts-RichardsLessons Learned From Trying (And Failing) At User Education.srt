4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,080
anyway

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,719
um i'd like to start with a question

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,480
uh but let's stop i'm not i'd like to

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,799
ask you how many of you are completely

8
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,039
up to date on your organization's

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,720
mandatory training

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,400
so whether that's your fire safety your

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,240
hr your manual handling blah blah blah

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,480
how many of you are completely up to

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,039
date on that training

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,599
and please put your question please put

15
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,920
your answers in the chat

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,840
so hi my name is oliver bets richards

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,320
and you won't remember me from any

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,800
other information security conferences

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,960
but i'm an information security analyst

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,760
at the university of derby

21
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,520
i've dabbled in information security

22
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,960
awareness training for the last couple

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,160
of years now

24
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,239
much of that experience has been virtual

25
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,640
to drink covered times and i've done a

26
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,640
couple of in-person sessions as well

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,039
the aim of this session is to

28
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,840
give some advice and some practical tips

29
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,440
to help us with both of those settings

30
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,799
it shouldn't really matter whether we're

31
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,520
virtual or in person for this

32
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,080
because most importantly i want you to

33
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,119
join me

34
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,280
in making more impactful

35
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,320
interesting and resonating content

36
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,479
this won't be a self-deprecating talk

37
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,400
but the content is based on lessons that

38
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,000
i've learned and things that i feel i

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,400
could have done better

40
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,479
and if you want to find out more about

41
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:27,200

42
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,200
you can find me on the socials at the

43
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,600
foot of the deck i'm on twitter

44
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,720
discord

45
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,400
and linkedin

46
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,560
all that hail nolly

47
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,560
yeah

48
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,320
and if you have kind things to say

49
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,240
please join the conversation on twitter

50
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,159
and use the hashtag beercon3 as you can

51
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,360
see on the deck

52
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,520
and if you have unkind things to say

53
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,720
i'll still like to hear them but please

54
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,560
do dm me on twitter and i'm happy to

55
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,600
talk about anything in this conversation

56
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,640
so you're probably wondering why we're

57
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,479
even having this conversation if i'm

58
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,680
saying that information security

59
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,320
awareness training doesn't work

60
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,079
people are still clicking on phishing

61
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,240
links people are still giving away their

62
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,759
credentials

63
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,840
and verizon are still saying that most

64
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,840
breaches have some form of mysterious

65
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,599
human element to them

66
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,760
so you might think it's about how our

67
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,920
customers understand technology

68
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,840
but i think it's more fundamental than

69
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,520
that most people

70
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,280
don't understand what we're talking

71
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,640
about

72
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,959
most people don't understand our

73
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,959
terminology

74
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,400
and here's the kicker most people

75
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,360
probably don't care either

76
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,959
i know that information security is

77
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,959
important to you and me

78
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,640
it's just otherwise why would we be here

79
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,560
in the first place

80
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,239
it's just a lot less important for just

81
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,920
about everybody else and we need to

82
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,720
empathize with those people

83
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,239
because we see all the time that we're

84
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,599
busy that we're overworked

85
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,239
and reaching burnout but guess what

86
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,000
everybody else is just as busy as we are

87
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,640
and it's our job to inspire them to care

88
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,519
more

89
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,599
about information security as well as

90
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,599
the rest of the cognitive plates that

91
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,040
they're spending on the on the daily

92
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,000
all hope is not lost

93
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,800
i hope that this conversation

94
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,360
can give you some practical steps on to

95
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,360
help you build effective information

96
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,159
security awareness campaigns

97
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,519
and what i want you to take away from

98
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,080
this is that most people don't know

99
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,480
anything about information security

100
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,640
particularly most adult professionals

101
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,879
and they probably carry less and it's

102
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,920
our job to change that

103
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,239
and there's quite a lot of work to do

104
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,680
before we can even get started in our

105
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,799
campaign

106
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,400
and most of it doesn't even involve

107
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,799
information security but please stay

108
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,640
with me

109
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,000
planning an information security

110
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,080
awareness campaign is more than about

111
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,080
information security and how to

112
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,640
communicate with people

113
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,720
you need to have empathy with your

114
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,640
colleagues and you probably heard me say

115
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,040
empathy quite a lot during this talk

116
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,400
so that's one of the most important

117
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,959
things to me here

118
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,720
your colleagues have day jobs to do that

119
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,879
doesn't involve directly carrying out

120
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,959
information security and then most

121
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,040
likely is under resourced as we are and

122
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,040
they're being asked to engage with us on

123
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,918
top of all those things

124
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,759
i can't see the chat right now but i

125
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,639
know from my phone conversations at work

126
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,479
with others i know that a heck of a lot

127
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,280
of people are not up to date on their

128
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,720
mandatory training

129
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,040
so how on earth can we expect people to

130
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,479
engage with us and something that's

131
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:35,840
important to us

132
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,919
when we don't engage fully with

133
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,080
something that may be important to some

134
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,040
somebody else

135
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,880
oh crap

136
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,240
i've toggled through this fight sorry

137
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,680
sorry i've gone ready wrong here

138
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,120
we also need to remember that it's

139
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,919
horrifically difficult to do this alone

140
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,520
you need to identify who you need to

141
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,199
support you

142
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,120
and i'm very lucky to have supportive

143
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,639
colleagues around me on everything that

144
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,320
i've done on information security

145
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,800
awareness training you need to remember

146
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,039
that your campaign is a project

147
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,600
there's a start a middle and an end to

148
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,759
identify your learning outcomes

149
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,240
identify the narrative of your campaign

150
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,560
and identify what you want your audience

151
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,240
to get from your campaign

152
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,720
you need to

153
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,160
do a heck of a lot more planning than

154
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,919
just our to-do lists

155
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,000
you need to identify the who the what

156
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,120
the what

157
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,120
the why the when and the how

158
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,440
of what you want to say

159
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,280
and that's where a communications plan

160
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,639
comes in

161
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,919
we'll get more on that later

162
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,759
you need to remember that you're not an

163
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,120
educationalist

164
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,960
and that's not an insult i'm just

165
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,560
willing to bet that most people in this

166
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,680
conversation aren't trained educators

167
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,160
i'm not either

168
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,840
you need to remember that marketing is

169
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,360
important as well

170
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,600
you need to get your message out there

171
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,199
and i'm willing to bet that most people

172
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,560
in this conversation

173
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,759
aren't trained marketers either

174
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,000
to document all the skills you need to

175
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,520
put together your campaign and the

176
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,160
people you need to support you

177
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,840
the most important thing for me here is

178
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,000
to empathize with your colleagues and

179
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,280
try and think a bit beyond the

180
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,119
boundaries of information security

181
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,479
it's critical to know the skills you

182
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,479
need

183
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:31,840
it's also critical that you have some

184
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,080
content

185
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,680
and this is where we you need to think

186
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,960
about what's useful to your organization

187
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,960
you need to identify the risks

188
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,198
and challenges facing your organization

189
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,720
you need to remember that every

190
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,880
organization is unique

191
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,520
every organization has its own people

192
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,599
its imperatives its values

193
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,319
its cultures its politics every single

194
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,560
one is different

195
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,400
so there's a little merit therefore in

196
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,479
prioritizing talks about picking up usb

197
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,240
sticks in the parking lot when your

198
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,599
organization

199
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,520
prohibits using them

200
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,840
and similarly i think it's negligent to

201
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,479
avoid talking about securing paper files

202
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,720
if your organization gets through more

203
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,639
paper than the local library

204
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,479
so i need to think so you need to think

205
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,280
about your audience

206
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,800
i need to think about information

207
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,639
security and how it affects them and

208
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,639
their challenges

209
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,479
and that's where your educationalists

210
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,359
are your friends

211
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,759
your audience might not learn the way

212
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,520
you do

213
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,840
so reach out to them to help guide you

214
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,440
towards creating a campaign that will

215
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,039
engage as many people as possible

216
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,720
and document this as well this

217
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,319
information as well

218
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,759
it's critical to have your thoughts in

219
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,280
order

220
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,360
and most importantly

221
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,160
identify what your organization needs

222
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,840
and what your audience need as well

223
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,440
so we've got some great content ideas

224
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,039
you might think now's the time we can

225
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,039
probably start writing

226
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,800
i'm really sorry to say this a little

227
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,400
bit more thinking doing a bit more

228
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,440
exciting work we need to do first

229
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,120
you need a plan

230
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,120
in a plan that's got a bit more detail

231
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,560
on it than oliver plans to talk about

232
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,720
phishing emails today

233
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,960
you need a communications plan and

234
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,800
luckily for you i'm here to tell you

235
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,759
about what that is

236
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,680
this is where your project managers are

237
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,080
your friends as well

238
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,760
what are you gonna say

239
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,440
what kind of content are you gonna put

240
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,240
out

241
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,839
are you gonna put out presentations

242
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,919
articles screen savers digital signage

243
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,279
blah blah blah

244
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,720
what kind of content do you want to get

245
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,640
out there

246
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,640
who are you going to say it to

247
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,560
where are you going to say it how are

248
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,080
you going to say it when are you going

249
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,360
to say it

250
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,839
who is going to say it

251
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,120
it doesn't necessarily have to be you

252
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,839
doing all the talking

253
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,640
i strongly urge you to identify all the

254
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,800
communication channels you have in your

255
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,720
organization and rinse every single one

256
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,920
of them because we need to get our

257
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,519
message out there to as many people as

258
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,320
we possibly can

259
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,839
and this is also where your marketing

260
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,760
friends come in

261
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,640
marketing is much more than about

262
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,560
sales calls

263
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,720
from vendors pitching us the same stuff

264
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,839
over and over and over again

265
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,760
marketing will probably be your biggest

266
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,160
supporters

267
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,519
and they need to know there's a campaign

268
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,360
in the first place

269
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,640
and this way you have to empathize with

270
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,480
them as well because this is not their

271
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,240
day job

272
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,600
they've probably got heaps more

273
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,440
campaigns on the go as well whether

274
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,160
that's fire safety hr new new systems

275
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,080
blah blah blah they've probably got lots

276
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,480
of stuff on there on their plates and we

277
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,000
need to work with them to land your

278
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,800
message amongst the constant stream of

279
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,320
information overload

280
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,399
that your colleagues are experiencing

281
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,720
every day

282
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,399
and support them to get the word out

283
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,240
there and don't expect them to do all

284
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,720
the work

285
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,680
and document document document

286
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,000
the idea here is a working document for

287
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,600
your campaign now it's all going to take

288
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,519
shape

289
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,800
and the key thing i want to get across

290
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,680
here is the identity to rinse every

291
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,560
single

292
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,920
communications

293
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,360
channel that you have available to you

294
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,160
so we're about halfway through and this

295
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,600
is my rookie talks i'll be immensely

296
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,839
grateful for any feedback in the chat

297
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,720
like to know what i'm doing

298
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,320
i'll be very grateful for anything

299
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,880
you've got to say

300
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,240
and that's what halfway through i

301
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,800
thought we'd have a bit of a recap

302
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,320
because we've documented all the skills

303
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,240
that we need and the people we need to

304
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,480
support us and we've planned our content

305
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,720
we've got a communications plan

306
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,720
that maps how the campaign will all come

307
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,160
together

308
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,680
but there's a tiny bit more work to do

309
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,680
before we can get started

310
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,680
because it's one thing to have a great

311
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,519
campaign lined up it's one thing to have

312
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,360
a lot of great content

313
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,600
but unfortunately most people in our

314
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,880
organizations need some sort of

315
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,040
permission to do things

316
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,640
and that's where your awesome

317
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,279
documentation comes in

318
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,959
you need to sell this to your boss i

319
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,160
mean presumably they care about

320
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,000
information security so she'll be after

321
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,839
a good start there

322
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,440
and that needs to be sold to your boss's

323
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,880
boss as well

324
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,480
i mean hopefully they care about

325
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,399
information security so we might even

326
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,480
get a bit more traction there

327
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,240
but crucially

328
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,880
they can use their influence

329
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,480
to get a bit higher and a lot wider

330
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,920
they can help you get out into your

331
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,399
department

332
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,720
so in your iot department as well

333
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,320
because information security awareness

334
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,000
training isn't just for non-it people

335
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,160
they can also help you implement the

336
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,880
most senior people outside of iit

337
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,880
and engage your biggest stakeholder

338
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,480
group and that's your customers

339
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,920
because your senior leaders need to be

340
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,519
engaged and talk about your campaign as

341
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,040
well

342
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,200
because their employees their staff

343
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,959
spending time engaging with your

344
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,440
training takes away from their time to

345
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,600
do their day job and their managers need

346
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,240
to support this

347
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,560
so it's critical to get support for your

348
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,720
campaign and get the most influential

349
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,480
people on board

350
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,000
and this is a big milestone

351
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,440
so we've planned

352
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,200
an awesome campaign we've got some

353
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,680
awesome content lined up

354
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,279
crucially we've got the buy-in to launch

355
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,440
it so now it's time to put the content

356
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,440
together

357
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,399
please

358
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,800
please please lay off the fear the

359
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,480
uncertainty and the doubt because this

360
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,440
is no time for fear mongering

361
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,200
think about how often you've been

362
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,200
motivated to get out of there

363
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,720
and do your fire safety training when

364
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,839
you've seen an

365
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,639
incident on the news

366
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,160
and empathize again with your colleagues

367
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,320
you're fighting for their attention to

368
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,160
think about what they care about and

369
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,040
what you want from them

370
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,680
most people probably care about data

371
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,480
breaches as much as you do and i do

372
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,279
about how our expenses for example are

373
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,320
budgeted

374
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,440
when we go to conferences

375
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,519
never forget that people are giving up

376
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,399
their time

377
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,120
to engage with you

378
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,079
so produce content that most people can

379
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,320
understand

380
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,480
most people most adult professionals are

381
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,920
i don't think

382
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,279
can give a definition or working

383
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,880
definition of a finishing email let

384
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,440
alone a zero day vulnerability

385
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,399
and keep your content short and sweet

386
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,839
gravity is your friend

387
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,000
and make your content accessible

388
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,680
remember that not everybody who engages

389
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,880
with your content will have the same

390
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,040
abilities

391
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,639
so when you're doing presentations and

392
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,560
articles for example make sure your

393
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,040
images are descriptive alt tags or use

394
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,639
closed captions where you can like i'm

395
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,079
doing on this on this presentation here

396
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,320
now i have the benefit and a privilege

397
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,240
of a great mentor supporting me on this

398
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,279
talk

399
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,880
i also have the benefit and the

400
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,240
privilege of an amazing colleague to

401
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,480
support me

402
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,160
to get somebody to peer review your

403
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,160
content because we can spend hours

404
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,079
crafting the best articles the best

405
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,360
presentations

406
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,560
and we can miss all sorts of horrors

407
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,959
and so fresh eyes will always enhance

408
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,079
the quality of your work

409
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,040
and most importantly empathize empathize

410
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,120
empathize and make the content

411
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,320
accessible

412
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,680
never forget

413
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,519
that people spend the time with our

414
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,600
content it's time they're spending away

415
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,240
from other things they can be doing and

416
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,040
this

417
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,639
having this in the bank is another big

418
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,959
milestone because we've got our content

419
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,920
and we're ready to go

420
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,440
so we've got a great campaign lined up

421
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,279
we've got a lot of buy-in content in the

422
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,040
bank and we're ready to go

423
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,120
so it's time to get the content out

424
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,360
there

425
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,320
now it's time to talk about your content

426
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,839
now it's time to talk to your colleagues

427
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,839
about your content

428
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,279
it's under ask your colleagues to talk

429
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,120
to their their friends about your

430
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,560
content

431
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,959
because people need to know that your

432
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,199
message is out there

433
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,880
because you need to get your material in

434
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,160
front of as many eyes as you can

435
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,160
so get yourself out there and present

436
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,120
present present

437
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,800
people need to hear about information

438
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,800
security in a way that resonates with

439
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,040
them and the way in which they can make

440
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,399
more informed

441
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,160
and more secure decisions about their

442
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,320
personal their personal lives online and

443
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,199
also when they're at work

444
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,240
and you are the key to that

445
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,519
because you are the ones that are

446
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,120
empowering people to make positive

447
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,560
changes to our collective security

448
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,959
postures

449
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,959
and the key from here is to get that

450
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,360
content out there as far and wide as

451
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,600
possible

452
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,759
because we have to make that change we

453
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,880
have to affect that change

454
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,519
and now that's a heck of a lot of work

455
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,199
going out the way and now it's time to

456
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,480
celebrate because this is a huge

457
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,720
milestone we've done a lot of work with

458
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,240
our colleagues and hopefully we've made

459
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,680
a massive impact

460
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,519
so it's really time to give ourselves a

461
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,880
bit of a pat on the back and celebrate a

462
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,120
little bit

463
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,920
so the contents out there

464
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,519
the article has been read the

465
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,000
presentations have been watched

466
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,680
and it feels amazing to share knowledge

467
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,800
doesn't it

468
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,079
but there's only one thing we have to do

469
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,519
it's one thing knowing we've put out

470
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,079
some awesome content but we also need to

471
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,680
know that we're not howling into the

472
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,199
void

473
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,880
you need to know if your audience has

474
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,720
learned anything and you need to know if

475
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,199
your campaign has made an impact

476
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,399
you need to know if it's worth doing in

477
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,160
the first place really

478
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,320
and there are some handy and quite easy

479
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,279
ways we can do this

480
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,959
you can invite comments on your articles

481
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,079
for example

482
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,680
we can encourage people to give feedback

483
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,360
during the presentations

484
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,119
or encourage them to fill out evaluation

485
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,959
forms after them

486
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,679
i've even done quizzes during sessions

487
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,520
just to get a bit of a gauge with how

488
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,079
our messages are getting across

489
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,079
and talk to people i think that's one of

490
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,599
the most important things here to talk

491
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,559
to people

492
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,240
invite all the feedback you can get

493
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,000
it's critical that we get every bit of

494
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,919
it so we know we're not howling into the

495
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,880
void and we're making a positive impact

496
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,440
on all of our collective security court

497
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,840
postures

498
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,200
so what are the key things i want you to

499
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,400
take away from this conversation that

500
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,760
we're having right now

501
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,280
i'm going to read these all from

502
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,160
clockwise from the top left

503
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,000
and that's what most people don't know

504
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,160
anything about information security and

505
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,000
probably care even less

506
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,679
and that that's not designed to be an

507
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:52,799
insult

508
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,039
it just in my experience most adult

509
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,280
professionals don't and it's our job to

510
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,840
change

511
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,280
that we need to empathize with our

512
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,720
colleagues and think beyond the

513
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,919
boundaries of information security

514
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,679
and the language that we use and the

515
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,320
approaches that we take

516
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,400
you to identify what your organization

517
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,280
needs

518
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,919
and what your audience needs from you

519
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,679
and to use all the channels that you

520
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,919
have available

521
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,919
it's critical to get support for your

522
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,120
campaign

523
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,559
from as far

524
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:29,160
and as high and as wide as possible

525
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,400
because we are the ones that are

526
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,840
empowering people to make positive

527
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,280
changes to our collective security

528
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,679
postures

529
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,880
and get feedback any way you can

530
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,240
it's important to know you're not

531
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,080
howling into the void and making a

532
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,879
positive impact

533
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,360

534
