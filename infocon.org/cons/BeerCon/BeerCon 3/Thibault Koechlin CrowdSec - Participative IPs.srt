1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,839
hello everybody

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,200
uh thank you for having me so i'm uh

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,520
i'm the cto of protect and i'm going to

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,000
speak to you today about project

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
crosstak is an open source software that

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,840
intends to create um

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,199
open source and participative

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,720
ids and ips to create cti so a bit of

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,880
the why of the project but it will

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,119
become fairly obvious is

11
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,920
cyber security is finally one of the

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,760
sectors where throwing more money at the

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,840
problem doesn't make it go away we've

14
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,640
seen more and more recently bigger and

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,520
more value small size company

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,680
being reached and sometimes with very

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,640
rather

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,440
unsophisticated attacks or at least by

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,079
attackers at the very

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,879
fraction of the means for defense

21
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,360
and we only hear about the big ones and

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,199
all the smaller ones that you might know

23
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,680
we never hear of standards so there's

24
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,360
still the issue and

25
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,760
throwing more money off it at it doesn't

26
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,920
solve the issue and so

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,479
a bit about the why is that but even it

28
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,640
might be obvious for some of you but

29
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,799
typically sometimes a

30
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,479
delay between the publication of a

31
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,799
vulnerability and weaponized expert is

32
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,479
usually a lot shorter than the delay

33
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:15,920
between the publication of this

34
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,920
vulnerability and the ability for

35
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,000
everybody to upgrade

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,080
the impacted services and we can for

37
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,040
example take an example at a latest app

38
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,720
achieving abilities

39
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,000
and

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,920
i think some people have paid the price

41
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,920
for it and then there's a parameter

42
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,640
without even speaking about the

43
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,040
current uh let's say a sanitary context

44
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,439
and everybody that has been to possible

45
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,600
criminality etc with

46
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,159
pubic clouds and more or less modern

47
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,000
architecture that is used for software

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,880
as a analogy of the castle that was sold

49
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,880
by schizo for a while at least for the

50
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,240
last decade is something that is

51
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,240
definitely gone and he's probably never

52
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,840
going to come back again

53
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,799
and last but not least the money

54
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,479
money is always playing in favor of the

55
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,240
attacker because

56
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,320
people that are the real bad guys they

57
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,799
use very often stolen resources and

58
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,720
tools that are either free or

59
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,479
stolen but at least a fraction of the

60
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,959
cost of the ones that are defending and

61
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,599
as everybody that did pen test and then

62
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,879
defense knows when you attack you

63
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,680
only need to get right once to win but

64
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,520
when you defend you need to get right

65
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,760
every time else you lose

66
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,040
and

67
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,640
so given that this

68
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,120
castle strategy is something that is

69
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,120
never going to come back and

70
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,280
we want to suggest a different approach

71
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,200
that is really why we speak about the

72
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,280
participative aspects

73
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,959
there's two two things in this that

74
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,040
first of all the i.t resources are

75
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,000
scattered across the internet any medium

76
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,599
even medium-sized companies have

77
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,360
resources all over et cetera and we need

78
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,200
to be able to protect all of these

79
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,160
assets

80
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,040
and and this is how why the project

81
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,720
becomes possible is that we do believe

82
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,440
in the power of the crowd to try and

83
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,440
fight of this issue

84
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,239
so

85
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,959
somehow how it works so what we do is

86
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,800
that we are distributing a free and open

87
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,720
source software that helps people to

88
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,480
protect the infrastructure it might

89
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,519
share some

90
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,000
similarities with the fail to ban for

91
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,120
those of you that know it and it has a

92
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,480
bigger global

93
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,040
uh aspect so for this how it will accept

94
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,360
the software itself is able to read logs

95
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,040
it can be locked from prior sources it

96
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,599
can be log files but it can be as well

97
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,560
for mobile architectures like a crud

98
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,400
sorry cloud trail

99
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,080
and more or less actually any stream of

100
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,879
information that we can consider as logs

101
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,760
and then those logs they are going to be

102
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,519
passed to be normalized they are going

103
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,080
to be enriched for example geolocation

104
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,159
and so on before being matched against

105
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,319
scenario and this is where besides the

106
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,720
software being open source the community

107
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,040
aspect starts to kick in is that all

108
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,040
these parsers those scenarios and so on

109
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,120
they are part of a hub that is community

110
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,680
driven where people suggest some new

111
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,519
changes people want to i know there's

112
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,519
this funny apache series that comes out

113
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,360
people ask if we can get a signal to

114
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,879
detect it and so on

115
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,120
and so at this point you have been able

116
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,799
to pass and normalize your logs and

117
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,480
regem and match them against you know so

118
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,200
you're able to detect attacks and this

119
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,680
is where we

120
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,519
start to have some stronger opinions

121
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,759
that we do believe that two populations

122
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,440
facing the same issue are not going to

123
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,520
want to act in the same way for example

124
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,919
people dealing with male infrastructures

125
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,560
we'll see it as a very often rather okay

126
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,360
to

127
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,840
ban war branches or part of the internet

128
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,000
but on the other hand if you

129
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,520
say the same thing to someone that is

130
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,400
doing a transitional website or even

131
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,479
worse e-commerce they are going to see

132
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,320
that something very frightening and so

133
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,919
we do believe that people need to be

134
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,840
able to react how they want and even

135
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,400
more importantly at the level that they

136
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,800
want in their first future to the issue

137
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,360
for example facing an issue in an attack

138
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,360
in some cases you might want to simply

139
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,919
inject captures

140
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,600
via your obsidian or you might want a

141
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,840
more classical way to blacklist them on

142
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,759
your or ban them on your firewall but

143
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,280
you might as well go down into

144
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,199
applicative layers

145
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,600
to react differently and offer

146
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,479
broader ways of reaction and it's even

147
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,160
more true when you speak to people that

148
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,479
are facing not only purely technical

149
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,160
issues like someone trying to exploit a

150
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,160
vulnerability but more like business

151
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,360
issues

152
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,160
this

153
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,840
typical example will be for all the

154
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,840
people that are doing e-commerce that

155
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,160
can be facing attacks such as credit

156
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,600
card surfing

157
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,000
credential stuffing or even

158
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,479
boat scalping or produced healthy

159
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,960
and and this is where the

160
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,720
more important part of the project lies

161
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,479
is that once

162
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,320
the free open source software allowed

163
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,039
you to take a decision against an ipa

164
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,600
range or whatever unless you decided to

165
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,520
deactivate it you are going to share

166
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,120
what you call the metadata of the

167
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,120
sighting with the community you are

168
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,360
going to share the ips that you blocked

169
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,360
the scenario for which you decided to

170
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,280
block it and the time something that the

171
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,600
software does automatically and then

172
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,199
this information is

173
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,680
computed on our side mostly to deal with

174
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,919
false positive and poisoning which i

175
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,080
will come back to a bit later and then

176
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,000
they are going to be redistributed

177
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,360
automatically and share back with the

178
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,600
committee so that for example if you are

179
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,639
running a web application with a cms on

180
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,560
the apache or whatever

181
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,479
you are going when you are going to

182
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,720
report some ssh brute force or wordpress

183
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,520
brute force or more generic ftp attacks

184
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,520
you are going in exchange somehow to get

185
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,600
back lists of ips that are very likely

186
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,600
to attack you because we have seen them

187
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,440
massively attacking people with similar

188
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,240
configurations

189
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,400
and so this is why we say we are trying

190
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,360
to build kind of a ways of iq reputation

191
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,199
is that we distribute free and open

192
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,880
source software that allows people to

193
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,639
protect their infrastructures

194
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,960
and while doing so they collaborate and

195
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,160
they participate to a bigger city aspect

196
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,919
that is being shared back

197
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,360
to the community

198
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,520
so that the more users who have in the

199
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,039
more participants the better the

200
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,720
protection and

201
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,720
the stronger the overall network

202
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,639
strength is so it's a local ids and ips

203
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,360
that

204
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,720
feeds a global ctm

205
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,720
um

206
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,199
so from uh past experience who have seen

207
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,840
that even rather motivated attackers so

208
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,720
here i'm not speaking about uh if

209
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,400
a difference to the previous talk about

210
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,160
like apt and so on but more like you

211
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,160
know the background noise and the issues

212
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,639
that ninety percent of the people are

213
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,280
mostly and actually facing is that

214
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,479
for attacker or hacker very often pubic

215
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,800
ieps are one of the resources that is in

216
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,199
uh phoenix quantities we have seen it in

217
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,680
as either technical it can be a dinner

218
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,360
of service or even

219
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,120
more like a business-oriented attacks

220
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,919
such as attack against e-commerce actors

221
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,000
or bigger websites that

222
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,680
really rely on the website present to

223
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,520
have that business for me is that once

224
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,000
you manage to make them run out of ips

225
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,080
then they have less and less means to

226
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,520
attack and they to get their hands on

227
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,000
the right new ips etc so it's a really

228
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,680
finished resource for the attractor and

229
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,680
this is the level that we're trying to

230
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,479
play on

231
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,720
uh and so all this because it's a open

232
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,240
source project but at the end we're a

233
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,440
company so our plan is rather crazy

234
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,520
for us this open source software is a

235
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,599
mean and not the end our end game and

236
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,440
our target is we to create the biggest

237
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,720
cti by having a large number of users

238
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,039
and unlike some others approach that

239
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,839
will consist of running honeypots by

240
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,559
having real users who are facing as all

241
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,799
real attacks i mean attacks that are

242
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,399
never going to be targeted at the

243
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,799
honeypot and this is typically also more

244
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,800
like a business level attacks that might

245
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,279
be facing a website e-commerce actors

246
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,760
and so on

247
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,600
um

248
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,000
so given that for us this open source

249
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,480
software is really amin because our end

250
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,720
target is to create the largest and the

251
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,600
most accurate cti ever so it's truly

252
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,640
open source and there's like no catch so

253
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,160
it's as opposed to that can be mit

254
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,480
licenses are very permissive and it's

255
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,040
very friends as like somehow no strings

256
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,680
are attached and not only we do try to

257
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,839
distribute open source but we are trying

258
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,680
to create around this ecosystem and a

259
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,920
community where people are actually

260
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,399
actively contributing either in terms of

261
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,800
asking for supports for new services new

262
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,839
scenarios or as i spoke about

263
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,240
new bouncers to allow people to react a

264
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,000
different level and in different way to

265
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
a given attack

266
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,040
so given that the demo is often worth a

267
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,440
lot of stats and i do believe the

268
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,279
demographic will be with me will jump

269
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,920
directly into a demonstration so you

270
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,720
should now be seeing uh two terminals so

271
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,560
the upper one is going to be the

272
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,120
defender the one where we are going to

273
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,040
deploy protect and the bottom one is

274
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,720
going to be used to simulate some

275
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,440
attacks so this is a very standard

276
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,360
language machines like most of you

277
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,040
already

278
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,760
data centers with the nginx web server

279
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,399
ssh and so on

280
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,519
so uh we are going to install process

281
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,680
and one of the key points of cortex is

282
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,160
that we try to have a technical barrier

283
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,000
that is as low as possible one of the

284
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,079
promise that we want to make is that a

285
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,920
system administrator that is able to

286
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,399
appetite install protect on a machine

287
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,920
should be able to

288
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,240
get a significant and something that you

289
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,399
can visualize improvement of security

290
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,680
here i

291
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,160
installed uh protech and as we can see

292
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,240
protect detected the services that are

293
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,240
present on the machine so here so that

294
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,000
we have nginx running it further the

295
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
logs we have sshd running found up the

296
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,800
logs and that it's a linux service and

297
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,399
along this it installs what we call

298
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,800
collection so a collection is a current

299
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,959
and set of configurations so typically

300
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,839
passes and scenarios that allow you to

301
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,399
either cover a technical scope

302
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,640
or help you to address her given like a

303
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,279
technical issue so

304
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,079
just doing this uh setup of a protect is

305
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,680
uh over and so uh we are going to uh

306
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,560
transform an attack on our server so

307
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,880
it's pretty

308
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,680
so

309
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,959
i'm going to

310
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,920
run a good old nicto targeting my web

311
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,839
server so for those that

312
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,279
i have a leftover also previously

313
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,680
selection

314
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,200
so

315
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,880
uh i'm going to

316
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,839
launch a web scan

317
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,040
on my web server and what is going to

318
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,800
happen is that protects simply out of

319
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,040
the box will be able to

320
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,880
detect those attacks so here typically

321
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,399
so nitto is a web

322
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,240
application that scanners that is not

323
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,720
very sophisticated but as a typical

324
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,680
behavior of a web application

325
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,720
here we can see that uh my pc the ip i

326
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,240
used to attack

327
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,480
this one um is being uh triggered for

328
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,639
performing like a fast traversal problem

329
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,480
so trying to express this uh well-known

330
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,639
vulnerability uh trying to do excesses

331
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,880
probably trying to access values well

332
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,880
known by doors and so on

333
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,079
and so um what happened is that uh fort

334
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,839
sach

335
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,639
uh decides that this ip this is my

336
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,120
attacker ip here in the amazon

337
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,000
island

338
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
should be banned for four hours because

339
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,600
it performed various attack and the last

340
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,839
one being hp probing which is like

341
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,839
trying to access a lot of distinct files

342
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,920
that doesn't exist on the web server

343
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,399
however if i go from

344
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,880
my attacker point of view

345
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,040
i can see that i'm not like i can see

346
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,720
access the website because as i said

347
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,320
earlier protect is in charge of the

348
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,639
detection uh while

349
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,480
in order to be able to react to a

350
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,839
component we're going to set up a

351
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,959
bouncer and so all the bouncers cpks can

352
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,040
be found on the hub so i'm just going to

353
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,120
showcase a few of them but if i was

354
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,040
using kd as a web server i could use a

355
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,440
voucher directly at my cadillac server

356
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,120
level if i was using gcp or aws i could

357
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,680
manage correctly my aws gcp firewall

358
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,880
rules if i was using a cdna cloudflare i

359
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,480
could interact directly with a pair of

360
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,079
cloud shares to take some decisions and

361
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,199
so on

362
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,600
or more likely like you know fail to ban

363
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,839
each setup having something that

364
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,399
interacts directly with the file

365
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,440
and

366
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,680
as we can see that we can even go down

367
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,000
into application layers like we're

368
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,279
distributing um libraries for php even

369
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,040
like a bouncer for php so that you can

370
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,079
install

371
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,680
sorry

372
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,360
wordpress plugins that will allow you to

373
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,279
regularity at your application

374
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,440
anyway so here what i'm going to do is

375
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,839
that i'm going to install

376
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,000
uh bouncer for

377
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
uh

378
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,440
i'm going to install the bouncer for

379
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,199
angelix so

380
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,719
by doing this and um

381
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,279
so by doing this what is going to happen

382
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,279
is that now that i've done this

383
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,199
and if i try the attacker to access my

384
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,199
website again i'm now being blocked

385
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,279
instead of having a 200 i'm getting four

386
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,680
sleep because binding is a bouncer

387
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,079
nginx has gained the ability like it is

388
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,920
an ip doesn't know it's going to query

389
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,920
crowdsack crosstalk is going to say no

390
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,720
this ip should be done

391
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,279
for four more hours and so instead of

392
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,720
letting the request go through the

393
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,120
application it will block me directly

394
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,480
for the follow-up of the demo um

395
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,639
i'm going

396
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,560
to delete

397
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,360
my

398
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,680
and so uh of course

399
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,839
now if i try to access my website again

400
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,800
i can access it again so this is simply

401
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,720
like to showcase

402
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,279
the ability of protect a bit out of the

403
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,399
box

404
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,160
to detect various attacks and to provide

405
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,480
you like a base level security

406
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,480
one might ask how

407
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,760
are those

408
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,920
scenarios and sound made so for example

409
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,320
if we are looking at the

410
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,199
we are using here we are using nginx if

411
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,880
we look at the nginx collection it's

412
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,440
going to contain passers for nginx logs

413
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,240
and then a lot of various scenarios so

414
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,160
typically if we're like uh trying to

415
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,279
detect

416
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,320
um

417
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,480
someone that is performing i don't know

418
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,959
yes hp probably it's a good example it's

419
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,880
a typical behavior of a web application

420
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,639
with apt scanner we're going to try to

421
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,880
request a lot of values files that

422
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,759
doesn't exist but uh very often very

423
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,720
distinct files and so as we can see all

424
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,959
the passwords and all the scenarios they

425
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,040
are very simple email files and

426
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,639
behind this very

427
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,959
fancy website actually

428
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,480
it's simply

429
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,240
a github

430
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,720
repository so that people can contribute

431
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,360
itself

432
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,079
however as we say uh if uh security

433
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,959
school dashboards are often cooler so

434
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,320
what we are going to do is that we are

435
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,680
going to

436
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,199
set up a small dashboard on the machine

437
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,399
so

438
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,480
this dashboard we are using metabase for

439
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,160
those of you that are not familiar with

440
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,720
it it looks like a bit like a kibana or

441
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,160
something like this it allows you like

442
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,519
to create dashboards on various

443
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,759
databases so here uh sequel light

444
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,680
it's going to take a proper few minutes

445
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,160
because a metabase is a java software

446
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,959
and actually how it works it's simply

447
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,160
going to run

448
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,880
a docker

449
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,720
image

450
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,800
contain metabolism is going to export us

451
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,120
some dashboards

452
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,079
so in the meanwhile what i'm going to

453
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,519
show you to take another thing

454
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,280
one thing that so um as we know there's

455
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,359
very uh there might be often friction

456
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,559
between the

457
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,319
ops people and the security people

458
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,919
because

459
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,160
sometimes security software tends to

460
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,000
behave a bit like a black box or doesn't

461
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,959
really fit into what helps people like

462
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,240
to be running and ah so the dashboard is

463
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,079
now deployed so what i'm going to do is

464
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,039
that

465
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,840
we are going to

466
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,200
um we're going to

467
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,280
connect

468
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,879
on our interface so

469
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,840
so of course we are not going to see

470
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,240
much stuff in the dashboard because we

471
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,080
just deployed the software and we only

472
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,720
performed a few attacks

473
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,120
however we can see that we can get here

474
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,440
some simple observability like with a

475
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,320
geolocation of the tags ips

476
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,160
the timeline of the values attacks that

477
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,320
were triggered and so on and so

478
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,039
different kind of scenarios

479
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,880
but as we all know

480
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,280
very often for this kind of software the

481
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,360
main fear for ops people is false

482
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,080
positive and this was uh

483
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,080
something that is rather cool is that

484
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,640
for example i have my logs of 2019 and

485
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,480
i'm still trailing crosstalk i want to

486
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,919
see if it's

487
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,160
uh proper software and so what i'm going

488
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,320
to do is that i'm simply going to

489
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,200
be able to reprocess

490
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,080
my old logs from 2019 uh with protect

491
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,840
and we get the nginx card and by doing

492
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,799
so crowtech is going to reprocess the

493
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,480
login emergency time like it was really

494
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,200
2019 and as we can see it's here

495
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,520
detecting attacks that happen in january

496
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,320
2018 and so what it means that if i go

497
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,280
back

498
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,360
to my dashboard i'm not clicking at the

499
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,280
current time but that's the past time

500
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,880
typically i will see here all the events

501
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,200
all the attacks that i show in 2019s

502
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,240
that have been currently rejected

503
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,840
within the database and i can get

504
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,480
observability on it and what it allows

505
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,799
you to do there are several aspects that

506
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,480
first of all when for example you are

507
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,080
facing an attack you are creating

508
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,679
afterwards the scenario so that next

509
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,200
time it happens you can react

510
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,799
automatically

511
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,799
you will be able to run it on all locks

512
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,400
to see would have triggered false

513
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,000
positive force think activities and so

514
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,080
on it can as well be useful for people

515
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,240
performing forensics

516
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,120
or post-mortems by being able to match

517
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,080
big amounts of logs again uh given

518
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,480
scenarios and last but not least as well

519
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,480
for reporting because everybody loves

520
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,480
dashboards

521
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,320
so i'm going to show you to stop this

522
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,640
and one last thing i want to show you is

523
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,120
um crop tech is completely instrumented

524
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,760
for prometheus and so prometheus is

525
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,160
something that is very often fancied or

526
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,280
helps

527
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,799
so that you can get a very good

528
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,120
observability of what is going on it can

529
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,280
be used either to monitor the software

530
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,600
in a general way or even to troubleshoot

531
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,440
from a security point of view and then

532
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,000
create alerting and so on

533
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,280
so i'm going to go back to my uh slides

534
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,080
here okay

535
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,360
so

536
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,440
um okay

537
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,360
from the demo it might seem that uh

538
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,120
crosstak is just a

539
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,200
more fancy photo band but actually

540
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,039
there's a lot more behind it because all

541
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,960
the components that we have seen working

542
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,520
today the agent that passes the log that

543
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,159
does literally is a heavy lifting

544
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,159
it's a local apk that converts an alert

545
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,400
into a decision and

546
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,480
the bouncer that actually applies the

547
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,640
decision they are all communicating

548
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,360
through rest api so it means that while

549
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,400
here we are

550
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,400
demoing a very simple setup people are

551
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,200
using it a very larger setup so with

552
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,840
these agents that have been replicated

553
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,520
on both machines of the packet all

554
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,679
pushing the decision to a central api

555
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,039
and so on

556
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,240
um plus it interacts fairly well with

557
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,919
other two of the committees so typically

558
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,159
it has what we call a notification

559
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,720
plugins for slack splunk elasticsearch

560
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,720
so that you can push others from protect

561
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,240
within your cm

562
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,960
or even a generic http so that you can

563
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,520
allow it to push alerts to

564
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,840
more or less anything

565
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,240
so it's api driven so it's rather oops

566
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,120
friendly so as i spoke about a bit about

567
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,400
the

568
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,559
observability wizard prometheus it's

569
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,080
something that is very interesting to

570
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,919
ask what friendlies are

571
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,400
you can find value so three points or

572
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,440
like a

573
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,840
purpose

574
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,960
or msp

575
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,799
um plus

576
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,120
here we are doing a demo on the vm

577
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,080
because it's

578
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,520
maybe the thing that is easier to

579
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,679
understand but we are all distributing

580
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,760
uh helm charts and we are currently

581
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,760
publishing articles about integration of

582
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,159
context within uh serverless stacks so

583
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,200
that you can

584
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,280
typically have a bouncer that is not

585
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,039
even on firewall but it's simply like a

586
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,480
lambda authorizer so that you can

587
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,039
literally protect serverless application

588
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,000
easy

589
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,640
and one thing that i didn't show during

590
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,039
the demo is that in terms of response

591
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:12,000
here we spoke only about blocking an ip

592
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,760
and sound but the thing is that in many

593
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,480
cases we want to have a various kind of

594
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,320
response typically in a lot of cases we

595
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,520
want instead of simply banning an ip

596
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,880
because or

597
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,320
banning a wall country because you are

598
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,400
facing a very distributed attack you

599
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,919
will want in select for example to

600
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,919
present capture to the users and you

601
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,320
will be able to do this cpk using either

602
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,520
a cluster bouncer or simply by using

603
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,400
applicative libraries that are

604
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,360
publishing or typically or for example a

605
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,039
wordpress bouncer

606
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,760
um last but not least here we show a

607
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,080
rather simple setup but actually crotech

608
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,240
scales very well because logs are great

609
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,080
for sharding and the architecture of

610
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,799
protect with a agent being decoupled of

611
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:55,520
the

612
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,000
local api is something that is a really

613
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,840
suiting for

614
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,679
shading as well

615
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,159
and last but not least about portability

616
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,919
so as i show

617
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,240
during the demonstration we are

618
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,320
distributing deviant packages but as

619
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,039
well distributing rpm4

620
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,600
so all the sent to us amazon linux

621
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,760
reddit enterprise and soundbase we

622
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,760
distribute docker image we have freebsd

623
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,960
package we even have an open wrt package

624
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,320
and we have a windows

625
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,280
package i mean windows working

626
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,960
version that is on its way

627
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,080
during the demo we showed some rather

628
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,480
simple scenarios it was like a brute

629
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,240
force web application vulnerability

630
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,640
scanning and so on but given that all

631
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,720
this scenario all these parsers are very

632
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,039
simple ml files one can come up with

633
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,880
their own series and this one i'm doing

634
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,640
more to share with like what we have

635
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,000
seen people do with it uh so

636
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,960
for those that might not be familiar um

637
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,799
credit card stuffing is a

638
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,760
attacker not real attack but a practice

639
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,919
where someone gets answered a bunch of

640
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:05,600
stolen credit cards and they need to

641
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,440
validate them to know which ones are

642
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,120
burned and which one are still valid and

643
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,279
to do this they are usually going to

644
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,080
simply find an e-commerce actor and

645
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,480
validate all the credit cards through

646
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,799
their website the thing is that it's

647
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,159
extremely costly uh for the e-commerce

648
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,000
actor and it's something that is very

649
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,240
hard to find because these are extremely

650
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,919
distributed when you perform this kind

651
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,520
of attack you are usually renting

652
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,640
botnets and so on so that each ip is

653
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,880
only going to perform one transaction or

654
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,720
only a few requests and they are

655
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,480
strongly distributed when we speak

656
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,559
strongly distributed it's among the

657
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,440
thousands of public ip's address at the

658
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,960
same time

659
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,480
on your website trying to vader

660
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,120
creatures which is extremely costly and

661
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,039
when you are doing this kind of stuff

662
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,880
trying to find at the ip level it's

663
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,640
completely pointless it's about that so

664
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,159
the machines are spread

665
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,919
all around the globe and

666
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,000
that part of everything so you will need

667
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,799
to be able to react at a uh tbk at a

668
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,039
country level seeing all of a sudden i

669
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,039
have a huge traffic coming from pakistan

670
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,799
on my payment you know this is something

671
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,960
usual i may want to react or at an

672
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,039
autonomous system level if it's more

673
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,080
localized but doing so you take the risk

674
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,480
of simply losing a lot of legitimate

675
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,400
customers and that's why having various

676
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,919
remediations such as being able to

677
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,760
inject captures and sound is great

678
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,000
because it will allow you to effectively

679
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,240
mitigate the attack by presenting

680
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,640
captures to the people of the suspected

681
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,640
countries while still letting the

682
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,200
legitimate users go through the capture

683
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:35,919
and

684
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,840
perform as usual so this is a more

685
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,559
typical example of a rather complex

686
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,559
scenario or scenes that you can fight

687
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,880
with crotech

688
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,760
but

689
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,520
uh only all the plane is ready to have

690
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,360
something that is very low force

691
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,760
positive and uh literally no false

692
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,240
positive so that it should become a

693
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,400
no-brainer you deploy a limited

694
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,799
expression that is going to be exposed

695
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,880
to intent you will want to the protect

696
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,640
because it's going to allow you some

697
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,000
hassle uh sending you a lot of

698
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,559
alerts to your cm and overreducing the

699
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,840
other fatigue

700
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,320
and then so

701
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,799
one thing i want to show i didn't show

702
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,520
quickly during the demo is that so on my

703
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,679
machine

704
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,159
i have a

705
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,679
i have taken only one local decision oh

706
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,919
and she in the meanwhile there's someone

707
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,400
else that attacked me from china telecom

708
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,159
trying to scan for open process intent

709
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,159
is a dangerous place people

710
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,799
but what i want to show is that so these

711
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,840
are my local decisions however

712
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,320
as i have been contributing by sending

713
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,159
information to protect

714
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,080
actually i received a lot more pdf like

715
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,159
800 ips already in my blog please

716
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:55,919
because crosstalk has been feeding me

717
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,840
black ips from the communities that are

718
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,279
very very likely

719
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,720
to attack me

720
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,039
and um this is what i'm going to talk

721
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,720
about is that people are really into

722
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,480
like a shame concept people send

723
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,000
information we send them information

724
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
back to us again better protection and

725
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,480
we get more information it's a

726
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,919
virtual circle

727
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,039
and then

728
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,200
but some uh previous approach on

729
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,039
participative security like this trade

730
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,440
and two things that we

731
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,360
think are very important

732
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,279
to attend to diseases first of all like

733
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,840
the context my grandma with her out of

734
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,840
date window that has been infected by a

735
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,679
worm and that is scanning all the remote

736
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,919
desktop of the internet if she goes on

737
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,200
the e-commerce website that she's

738
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,919
running on php or htm son first of all

739
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,600
she's not technically a straight for

740
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,679
this e-commerce website because it's not

741
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,320
running remote desktop and the

742
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,720
worm or the infections over she has only

743
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,000
knows how to attack this kind of

744
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,919
technology so there's always about

745
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,200
evaluating

746
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,200
the compatibility between your

747
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,120
exposition surface and the attack

748
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,720
capability of the attacker and that's

749
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,200
why when we're re redistributing the ip

750
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,360
list as we're doing here and we are

751
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,840
seeing i'm only receiving ips that are

752
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,120
likely

753
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,919
to attack me based on the services

754
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,679
that i myself am running and the

755
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,520
scenarios i have configured

756
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,720
to be running

757
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,640
and then there's a time dependency that

758
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,440
in 95 of the case a machine that i

759
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,120
attacked me today is a machine that was

760
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,039
clean a few day or a few hours or even a

761
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,640
few weeks ago

762
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,480
it was an outdated website or in

763
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,799
vulnerable software it got rich and then

764
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,440
it's been used to perform attacks and

765
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,000
wonder another legitimate owner is going

766
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,919
to be made aware that his machine is

767
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,120
infected and

768
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,559
doing a lot of stupid stuff on the

769
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,880
internet and then he's going to take

770
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,799
hopefully it's a necessary step to clean

771
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,039
it back and then the ip will become good

772
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,360
again and so that's why typically in our

773
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,559
case ap that stops attacking for between

774
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:52,240
three days 72 hours and one week

775
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,320
i will be considered clean again because

776
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,840
it stopped attacking we start getting

777
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,440
signals and we are going to suppose that

778
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,080
very lightly the legitimate owner cleans

779
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,600
their stuff all the hosts are shut down

780
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,600
the machine and then the ip is going to

781
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,880
go out

782
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,760
um

783
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,840
of the of the database and it's going to

784
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,600
be stopped to be distributed so the plan

785
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,679
is ready to rather focus on the

786
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,840
freshness and the accuracy of the leads

787
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,200
that were distributing back on the

788
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,240
committee rather than trying to uh

789
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,159
huge numbers and distribute ips that are

790
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,720
clean for like forever or or needed a

791
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,159
few attacks and they're actually not a

792
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,799
real strategy

793
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,279
um one question that i might want to ask

794
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,200
when seeing such a project is that how

795
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,720
do we deal with projecting enforced

796
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,880
positive because let's be honest for us

797
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,360
this is actually a real challenge the

798
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,600
open source part is something that is a

799
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,960
it's not no rocket sense as we say

800
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,720
so what happens is that

801
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,760
we won't be able to prevent a user to

802
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,840
try to poison the system however we can

803
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,880
make it

804
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,880
stupidly expensive so that it's not a

805
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,000
viable option because here we are always

806
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,360
you know speaking about return on

807
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,960
investment when you're speaking about

808
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,720
other attackers things because attackers

809
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,240
are doing business

810
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,840
like like you do

811
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,720
so

812
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,039
all the users they get what we call a

813
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,200
trust frank so the trust rank is how

814
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,559
much we trust the user like typically

815
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,080
you install the software you start to

816
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,000
report some things your reports are not

817
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,679
even going to be taken into account

818
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,440
they're very big who are going to wait

819
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,559
for

820
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,240
because your trust factor is too low you

821
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,799
just deploy the software

822
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,720
you are but after a few weeks or a few

823
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,159
months where you continue to send

824
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,919
information now we say okay we don't

825
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:31,679
know if this user is malevolent but at

826
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,480
least he's spending some resources to

827
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,080
send us information so he's using

828
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,880
probably some cpu and so on and here's

829
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,120
the procession of a public ap address

830
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,240
that you used to send us some

831
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,919
information so

832
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,080
it means that there's a cost uh somehow

833
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,559
to do these things as a commitment and

834
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,159
then as well what we're going to do is

835
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:51,440
that we are going to

836
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,000
evaluate so this is a persistent and

837
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,600
then we're going to evaluate as well the

838
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,760
possibility because typically we are

839
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,799
running a fleet of honeypots on the side

840
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,799
and the honeypots for other various

841
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,559
interests first of all there were a way

842
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,799
to kick-start all the the more consensus

843
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,120
mechanism and the reputation system and

844
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,799
now there is one for example a great way

845
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,200
for us to validate information from new

846
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,240
users

847
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,320
i insert crowdsack so a very low

848
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,240
reputation and then i report that ip one

849
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,919
two three four is performing i don't

850
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,000
know

851
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,760
summer trying to exploit the late test

852
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,159
up achieving damage and then later this

853
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,640
information is confirmed by a honey but

854
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,480
then we are going to do that not only

855
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,919
i'm running protect but i'm running

856
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:33,600
protect on some real traffic and i've

857
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,679
given some information that the system

858
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,000
didn't know before so that my reputation

859
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,480
is going to slowly increase

860
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,559
um then of course we have all the

861
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,320
whitelist mechanism because we know that

862
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,240
force positive is one of the main fear

863
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,120
for a lot of this software and this part

864
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,039
is completely shared with the open

865
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,200
source project so it's a way like to

866
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,360
easily ensure that

867
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,799
at no point even if people have

868
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,159
misconfiguration who are going to

869
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:00,640
redistribute i don't know cd and pubic

870
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,120
ips are being has been bad guys and so

871
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,480
on

872
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,320
and then and this is the part where we

873
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,080
are actually working is what we call

874
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,919
like all the predictive algorithm is

875
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:10,960
that

876
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,279
in a lot of case you are going to see

877
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,919
ips that have no obvious link all

878
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,840
together but actually they'll be they

879
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,919
belong to the same organization they are

880
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:21,360
managed and controlled by the same

881
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,880
attackers but there is a single

882
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,720
president because it's a botnet or

883
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,559
because it's a group of infected

884
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:28,000
machines that is running a specific

885
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,080
malware and so on and first one of the

886
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,240
changes to be able to identify the weak

887
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,480
link between all these signals

888
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,919
and we have seen

889
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,720
it tpk with groups that were targeting

890
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,640
some very specific

891
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,039
web applications where some credit cards

892
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,640
were being processed where you have one

893
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,399
ap that comes and does fingerprinting

894
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,720
then you have another ip that comes and

895
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,240
does exportation and then you have a

896
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,000
solid ip that is going to only access

897
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,320
that offset byte but being able to

898
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,960
create a link and say i p a b c d and e

899
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,640
they all work together because you all

900
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,080
see them

901
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,000
and always see them moving all together

902
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,919
there's a great information because then

903
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:06,960
you can let's say peel the onion of

904
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,200
anonymity that is used by the attackers

905
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,640
to do it

906
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,559
and the thing is that we are not naive

907
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,519
we do know that nowadays for a motivated

908
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,679
attacker it's fairly easy and

909
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,480
artificially cheap to get your hands on

910
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,960
hundreds or thousands of public ips by

911
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,279
using cloud providers and so on however

912
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,039
which is very hard to achieve and this

913
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,360
is what we take massively into account

914
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,480
when we decide whether an ip should be

915
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,840
sent back to the committee as being

916
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,760
malevolent is

917
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,000
the diversity of the people that

918
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,440
reported it and their individual

919
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,799
reputation

920
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,960
and this is all these factors that are

921
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,120
put together and that we are putting

922
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,000
together that allows us to

923
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,760
end their project we are using to being

924
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,519
able to crunch all this data that is

925
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,760
being sent by all the users

926
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,720
that have and eliminate false positives

927
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,039
make poisoning so stupidly expensive

928
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,399
that it's not going to be a viable or

929
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:05,519
useful option before being redistributed

930
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,159
uh plus in case my accent already didn't

931
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,520
get me away but i'm french so gdpr is

932
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,239
kind of a big topic for us and so it's

933
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,839
very easy for people to invent

934
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,679
themselves like uh some forms on the

935
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,679
website and so on and so it's something

936
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,000
that tends to be rather open and we're

937
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,199
not trying to

938
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,760
take anyone at home stage

939
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,199
um

940
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,040
one question that might arise as well is

941
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,359
that uh if everything is free how are we

942
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,119
going to make money and goods paying for

943
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,440
all this um

944
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,159
so two aspects in this so first of all

945
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,079
the logs that you processed with kratek

946
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,480
are never exported as i said earlier

947
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,399
it's only once you are going to take a

948
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,079
decision to ban an ips that you are

949
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:47,679
going to share the eyepiece that you

950
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,440
band the name of the scenario for which

951
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,918
you bend it and uh the timestamp so this

952
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:53,359
is the thing and then what do we

953
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,679
monetize so for us we are fairly

954
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,119
transparent that this open source

955
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,359
software first is a mean and not the end

956
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:02,400
our end target is to create a huge gti

957
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,400
by having hundreds of thousands of

958
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,160
machines around the world that are

959
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,599
running real infrastructure real

960
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,920
applications so that we get a level of

961
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,240
information that is a lot more relevant

962
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,680
that's what we can get with a purely

963
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,000
honeypot for example so this is our end

964
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
target and in the meanwhile we have as

965
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,839
all the parts that i didn't show during

966
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:21,839
the demo i don't know if i might still

967
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,240
have yes not much time but

968
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,040
um

969
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,119
it's a console that allows you like to

970
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,599
manage values instances this is premium

971
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,240
so it should stay and will stay free for

972
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,040
small companies and so on but in which

973
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,440
we are slowly introducing some features

974
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,359
that might be more relevant like to

975
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:42,480
companies or organization management sso

976
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,880
and so on to try to make some money on

977
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,480
the site

978
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,480
but so to submit up so how we intend to

979
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,720
make money is by being able to sell

980
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,880
access to people that want to access the

981
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,800
data without contributing to it or that

982
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,119
want to access all the data at once and

983
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,560
not simply what is relevant for them

984
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,040
so and it will be my closing words just

985
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:03,839
a

986
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,320
few results or a few information so

987
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,160
the v1.0 came out last december so the

988
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,280
project is fairly young but as you can

989
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,280
see we are growing quite fast we have

990
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,160
around 10 000 in south worldwide so 110

991
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,040
countries who have a huge variety uh

992
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,640
over the last three months we have been

993
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,960
seeing around like 700 000

994
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,520
ips with very strong qualifications that

995
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,880
have been blocked

996
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,640
and we are very conservative about what

997
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,400
could we distribute so it's around uh

998
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,079
three percent

999
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,000
and we have a use case across varsity

1000
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,079
industries we have some uh

1001
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,320
like hyperscalers that are using it but

1002
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,000
as well a lot of smaller business

1003
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,359
smaller hosters smaller companies on uh

1004
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:46,960
one of the key point being as it's a

1005
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,960
very low technical barrier it's not only

1006
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,599
targeting security people but

1007
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,839
people that runs infrastructure and for

1008
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:55,520
which security is something that needs

1009
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,320
to be dealt with without necessarily

1010
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,480
having too much human bandwidth to spend

1011
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,560
into it

1012
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,640
and that will be it for me

1013
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,880
i think i'm running out of my time so

1014

1017
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,400

1018
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,240
sorry tebow we just had to unmute

1019
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,200
ourselves

1020
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,960
that's right

1021
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,680
okay so mind

1022
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:34,640
absolutely blown here

1023
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,119
so many great things are going on with

1024
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:37,920
this

1025
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,400
tool and the fact that you pulled off a

1026
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,280
live demo i mean everyone on the chat

1027
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,599
right now is like super impressed with

1028
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:46,480
that

1029
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,000
i i think

1030
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,480
what you're showing me was

1031
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,960
amazing because i've seen a lot of

1032
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,839
offerings from commercial like

1033
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:58,880
for-profit entities and it seems to me

1034
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,760
that this is more community-driven

1035
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,560
community supported but i mean obviously

1036
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,480
you're going to make some money with it

1037
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,440
you know

1038
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,240
but

1039
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,520
i i was just amazed at how much it is

1040
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,119
being done

1041
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:17,440
to identify those malicious ips verify

1042
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,480
that it is a malicious ip and one of the

1043
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,960
things i've i've never heard in many

1044
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,200
many talks is about dumping those ips

1045
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,400
once they've been rehabilitated or taken

1046
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,040
down or something like that so amazing

1047
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,760
talk so yes thank you very much

1048
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,520
here's the thing that uh

1049
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,839
in our opinions this has been one of the

1050
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,720
main issues uh with a participative

1051
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,160
project is that

1052
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,560
if you uh given like an ip ninety

1053
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,320
percent of them is just a legitimate

1054
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,400
machine guard ration you know that some

1055
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,920
hosters are very

1056
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,839
uh doing a lot of due diligence once

1057
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:55,440
they receive abuse like tpk you run

1058
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,839
things at amazon you get a few updos and

1059
00:38:57,839 --> 00:38:59,119
if you don't deal with your shoes are

1060
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,960
going to shut down your machine so

1061
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,400
saying that you are bad you are bad

1062
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,280
forever is something that makes no sense

1063
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,000
even with a pubic clouds where i pubic

1064
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,520
ip address is something that is being

1065
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,440
permanently redistributed and so on so

1066
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,640
yes for c3 one of the key points

1067
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,480
yeah absolutely amazing i'm going to

1068
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,280

1069
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,240
