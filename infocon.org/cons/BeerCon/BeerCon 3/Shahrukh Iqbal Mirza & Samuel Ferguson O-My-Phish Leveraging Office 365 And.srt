player

62
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,120
so

63
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,760
let's start with the

64
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,200
our presentation

65
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,959
now since everyone know who we are and

66
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,239
what we do

67
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,200
so

68
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,959
let's start with the presentation itself

69
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,480
and talk about

70
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,160
catching fish

71
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,239
so what is fishing

72
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,319
uh fishing is basically a social

73
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,319
engineering attack that attackers do to

74
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,319
exploit someone's level of trust or

75
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,879
someone interest in something and for us

76
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,400
red teamers

77
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,480
we carry out fishing activities as a

78
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,800
part of our adversarial emulation

79
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,160
engagements

80
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,800
uh well fishing can be used to steal

81
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,120
sensitive data or install

82
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,680
malicious tools on a victims computer

83
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,519
basically phishing has two main

84
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,680
objectives first being credentialed

85
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,360
harvesting

86
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,720
where you

87
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,879
fish the victim for their credits to

88
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,800
their emails social media then bank

89
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,519
accounts etc and the other being payload

90
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,959
delivery where you deliver your own

91
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,760
payload to get a call back on your c2 or

92
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,760
in the form of a reversal or whatever

93
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,959
your desired actions are

94
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,440
so

95
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,599
fishing has been a real challenge lately

96
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,519
with the email gateways becoming more

97
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,280
and more efficient and old-school

98
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,319
fishing techniques work no more right

99
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,640
so the basic challenges arising in

100
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,120
phishing in our opinion are listed here

101
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,319
like email security gateways becoming

102
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,799
efficient day by day and flagging our

103
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,959
attachments or links

104
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,280
uh malicious and warning the emails of

105
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,360
uh suspicious activity

106
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,440
email getting flagged as a spam and not

107
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,519
landing in the victim's inbox and rather

108
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,920
going to the victim's junk or spam

109
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,040
folder

110
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,480
and thirdly

111
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,959
uh user awareness people these days are

112
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,200
becoming more and more cyber resilient

113
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,200
and they take caution when clicking on

114
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,280
unknown links or download

115
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,680
malicious attachments in the email

116
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,159
so today our talk will be based around

117
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,720
by passing these challenges and to start

118
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,640
off i'd like to hand over the mic here

119
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,480
to sam and

120
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,239
please start cool

121
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,840
all right whoops

122
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,160
click there so um

123
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,120
as shot so pointed kind of got started

124
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,639
with you know general fishing we're

125
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,440
gonna talk more about how uh office 365

126
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,160
or as it's known now microsoft 365. i

127
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,560
still call it a 365. so

128
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,560
i'll probably refer to it as that um how

129
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,280
we can utilize that to uh

130
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,400
leverage

131
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,560
things like you know kind of generic

132
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,479
phishing infrastructure

133
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,639
or maybe some potential bypasses that

134
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,639
might get around some security controls

135
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,400
the first thing i want to start off with

136
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,199
is phishing sas or software as a service

137
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,680
because um building a proper

138
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,680
quote-unquote proper infrastructure

139
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,280
isn't always necessary um maybe you have

140
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,800
you know a very short-term engagement

141
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,560
where the time investment that needs to

142
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,320
go into setting up proper phishing

143
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,680
infrastructure um is much higher uh than

144
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,199
you'd like to maybe you have a

145
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,199
particular one-off test that you want to

146
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,039
try you just saw something on twitter

147
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,639
like ah man i really want to test this

148
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,000
out see if it will work against your

149
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,919
organization um maybe also your

150
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,199
organization you know doesn't really

151
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,440
have the resources to you know build up

152
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,840
its own infrastructure properly and you

153
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,520
need to look for some more uh cost

154
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,759
effective solutions to that

155
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,960
and microsoft uh luckily actually is

156
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,199
pretty helpful for us potential fishers

157
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,479
because we've got a couple of options

158
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,240
that we can use here and the two that

159
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,320
i'm gonna really be focusing on in this

160
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,520
talk is of course outlook and microsoft

161
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,560
365 for small business so let's get

162
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,919
started with

163
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,120
something i'm sure we're all very

164
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,520
familiar with and that is microsoft

165
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,400
outlook it is of course the free online

166
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,160
email platform that you know and love

167
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,720
now why are we specifically looking at

168
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,800
outlook and even in general why might we

169
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,520
be looking at microsoft well outlook

170
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,840
itself is a microsoft product so it is

171
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,000
compatible with exchange and the

172
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,479
exchange platform is something that is

173
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,160
widely used throughout many

174
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,960
organizations lots of organizations

175
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,560
leverage you know things like active

176
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,759
directory and any sort of microsoft tool

177
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,000
because they just integrate so easily

178
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,639
it's very uh simple to use from that

179
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,479
perspective so there's a high chance

180
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,440
that an organization that you're going

181
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,360
to target you know if it's kind of

182
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,759
windows centric it's gonna be it's gonna

183
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,800
have exchange on those endpoints um so

184
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,160
because we're using outlook we've got

185
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,759
some platform specific fishing

186
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,440
opportunities that we can take advantage

187
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,080
of

188
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,840
uh now i will outline some of the

189
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,360
downsides that we have at outlook before

190
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,919
we get into kind of the details of it um

191
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,360
some of the downsides that i've seen

192
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,880
personally from testing it is you can

193
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,960
get blocked by microsoft spam so you

194
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,520
know just be aware of you know how many

195
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,960
emails and stuff you're sending out

196
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,440
don't uh send too many at a high high

197
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,599
rate um you might get caught really

198
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,160
easily so again for the target that

199
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,680
we're the target audience that we're

200
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,759
looking at you know those smaller uh

201
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,199
smaller tests where maybe you aren't

202
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,720
firing off as many emails they should

203
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,319
probably work and of course the other

204
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,400
thing is trade users will likely spot

205
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,280
out um a question any uh questionable

206
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,960
details about uh like itself uh

207
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,680
specifically with you know the email

208
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,479
calm so let's jump into some of these

209
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,240
specific techniques we can utilize and

210
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,240
first i want to look at the social

211
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,599
engineering text that you can kind of

212
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,520
utilize here and i've got some example

213
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,800
images you can take a look at um

214
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,880
so the first thing of course is your

215
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,880
name and email address which we can see

216
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,560
over here so

217
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,960
microsoft doesn't really filter too much

218
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,479
the only thing i will mention is it does

219
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,720
filter the word security so um which is

220
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,720
actually really funny because uh i

221
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,080
forgot to mention this i go by find

222
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,000
security so if you try to make like a

223
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,919
find security in outlook.com don't worry

224
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,080
security's blocked out but you know i

225
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,680
can make something like this we have the

226
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,319
acme help desk acme dash help desk

227
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,440
outlook.com so we're able to you know

228
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,599
create names that can either simulate

229
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,639
legitimate individuals or maybe sign

230
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,360
some uh organizations or units within a

231
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,039
business that would be trusted like help

232
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,400
desk for example

233
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,479
um and we can make it look relatively

234
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:15,759
believable when it's coming through and

235
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,800
again if it's coming through on a

236
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,160
microsoft product they're gonna see

237
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,639
things uh looking similar to this so

238
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,240
users will probably be inclined to trust

239
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,240
it and of course the signature setting

240
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,000
in outlook i mean this is not

241
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,199
necessarily these things aren't

242
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,039
necessarily unique uh but it's worth

243
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,479
mentioning because of course you know

244
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:31,919
these are things you can add to your

245
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,200
fishing engagements that are going to

246
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,039
make them look more and more legitimate

247
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,719
for signature especially if you're aware

248
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,719
of how the company you know formats its

249
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,159
email signatures and what those

250
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,519
typically look like

251
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,440
you could probably make an email

252
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,839
signature that looks very similar very

253
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,160
convincing or if you make up your own

254
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,240
kind of company that you want to pretend

255
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,880
that you're acting as you can create a

256
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,800
very legitimate looking signature and

257
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,720
that just kind of adds to the perceived

258
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,839
authenticity of the email so outlook

259
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,600
really only covers some of the basics

260
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,600
and that makes sense for the type of

261
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,519
service that it is it's pretty free you

262
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,279
know you've got things like you know the

263
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,920
ellic.com url that's probably going to

264
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,320
get caught by a normal user as this

265
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,080
seems kind of weird when they have their

266
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,720
own domain name um so

267
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,160
there's kind of issues with things along

268
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,440
those lines

269
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,600
but when we get into something like

270
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,240
microsoft 365 for small business

271
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,320
uh we get some

272
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,560
additional opportunities that come to us

273
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,120
so if you're not familiar what ms 365

274
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,279
for small business is it's a sas

275
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,560
solution that is targeted towards small

276
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,399
business users um and this is a solution

277
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,880
that actually for our purposes comes

278
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,800
with a free one-month trial which

279
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,959
basically means oh boy we got a free

280
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,760
month of fishing this is great so you

281
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,000
can set it up everything you do have to

282
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,839
put a credit card in all that you gotta

283
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,480
have famous messages but regardless you

284
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,000
can get at least a month set up and if

285
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,839
you even if you wanted to transfer this

286
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,240
into maybe a full-time fishing solution

287
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,240
or a more long-term phishing solution

288
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,839
you can get licenses for anywhere from

289
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,680
five to twenty us dollars per user per

290
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,480
month

291
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,399
um and the cool thing about this is it's

292
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,640
got access to the office suite of tools

293
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,480
and a bunch of other microsoft tools

294
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,560
which i'm gonna highlight um in just a

295
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,200
minute and this really expands on what

296
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,440
we're capable of doing within uh these

297
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,000
within this fishing uh as far as fishing

298
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,560
opportunities go for microsoft so let's

299
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,880
start taking a look at uh first some of

300
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,320
the social engineering techniques that

301
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,079
we can utilize obviously all the

302
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,760
techniques from outlook still apply an

303
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,880
email email and uh the names are still

304
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,040
important domain names this can be

305
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,680
really interesting so what microsoft

306
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,519
does is they give you a star dot on

307
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,040
microsoft.com email address

308
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,200
and what you can do is that asterisk

309
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,680
area you can put in pretty much any name

310
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,320
that you want um so you can see here

311
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,880
that i've got acme.microsoft.com

312
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,000
now for the observant people of new

313
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,760
you'll probably notice that i just lied

314
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,480
because this is not

315
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,519
acme.microsoft.com it's

316
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:08,000
acrme.microsoft.com so we're doing a

317
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,959
little bit of uh domain spoofing kind of

318
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,120
acting like you know vr or typo

319
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,959
squatting i guess might be a better uh

320
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,959
way of putting it uh so these are

321
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,040
techniques that you can utilize um if

322
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,800
you can maybe if you can't get a

323
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,760
legitimate domain so say

324
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,959
acme.microsoft.com was taken you know

325
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,279
kind of modify it change it a little bit

326
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:32,000
um put acme with maybe two e's or uh

327
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,480
something else that maybe will users if

328
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,680
they're just quickly glancing over the

329
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,399
email address it'll seem legitimate

330
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,760
another thing you can do in small

331
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,880
businesses obviously you can have

332
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,720
multiple users as you can see here i've

333
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,519
got

334
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,440
multiple users in this account and if

335
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,680
you're building a more full-fledged

336
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,639
phishing scenario uh you can maybe make

337
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,320
it where you know someone reaches out to

338
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,920
the client and then says hey can you

339
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,440
reach out to this other person they're

340
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,680
my superior um with your response and

341
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,880
that kind of adds to a bit of

342
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,880
authenticity of oh this is an actual

343
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,800
company with actual sort of hierarchy

344
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,160
and co-workers and things like that so

345
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,760
you can leverage that opportunity as

346
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,959
well

347
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:07,920
and the other thing that you can

348
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,079
leverage is customized sharepoint sites

349
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,200
so on this uh system you'll have access

350
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,120
to sharepoint and you can make these

351
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,279
sharepoint sites public so if you wanted

352
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,519
to make you know some sort of website

353
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,279
that sharepoint site that made it look

354
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,279
like oh you know this was just a site to

355
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,519
be shared between you know uh this

356
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,920
company your fake company and then the

357
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,519
target company because they have some

358
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,959
sort of partnership or something like

359
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,120
that you could actually do that and it's

360
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,880
a really cool opportunity and sharepoint

361
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,720
will actually come in uh just a little

362
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,040
bit later as first of our additional

363
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,079
techniques

364
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,079
so these are kind of the generic social

365
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,920
engineering techniques but shaw brought

366
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,360
up something that i want to talk a

367
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,959
little bit about and that is of course

368
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,920
the secure email gateways or segs and

369
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,240
these today are the frontline defense

370
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,880
against malicious uh messages they

371
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,519
provide detections on both urls and

372
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,680
attachments um and even urls that

373
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,399
download or redirect to a download uh

374
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,639
can be inspected so you know if you're

375
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,040
putting anything directly into the email

376
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,120
attachments that's malicious or a link

377
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,320
that directly downloads something

378
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,880
there's almost 100 certainty that you're

379
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,240
going to get caught unless it is

380
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,880
something that is extremely customized

381
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,200
and avoiding any sort of signature

382
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,920
detection uh that these sdgs might be

383
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,760
looking at some examples you might know

384
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,720
forcepoint proofpoint mimecast fire imx

385
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,160
or o365 uh defender safe links

386
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,079
so how can we get around this using a

387
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,560
microsoft uh suite of tools that we have

388
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,680
at our disposal so the first link is um

389
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,480
a outlook bypass for onedrive so a

390
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,600
legitimate url 45 location that can be

391
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,480
shared

392
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,240
via onedrive which puts it to the

393
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,000
onedrive url which i remember correctly

394
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,959
i think is 1drv.com

395
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,800
now obviously here we have an example of

396
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,360
microsoft's safe o365 safe links

397
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,800
rewriting it down here you can see that

398
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,040
name12.12.safelinks

399
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,040
um it can be rewritten but again it's

400
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,639
going to be a legitimate domain and may

401
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,040
add to some authenticity where the sdg

402
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,560
may be like oh this is from onedrive

403
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,760
this is okay

404
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,360
and again this content also appears

405
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,199
similar to any standard attachment that

406
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,120
was shown in email especially in

407
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,040
microsoft products they look almost

408
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,279
identical to just a normal attached

409
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,399
attachment

410
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,480
so that's kind of cool as far as outlook

411
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,839
goes um but what about ms365 and that's

412
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,279
where we kind of get to add in

413
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,680
sharepoint so in sharepoint you get a

414
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,680
shareable link that you can embed in an

415
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,519
email and you can make this shareable to

416
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,839
anyone at all anyone that you want to

417
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,320
share with which is super awesome

418
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,519
uh so of course you also get a

419
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,360
legitimate domain would be sharepoint

420
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,440
the sharepoint domain is awesome oh i

421
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,880
should have probably deleted that out

422
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,959
there little mistake for free to power

423
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,199
points boys and girls

424
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,120
and of course you get a nice little icon

425
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,639
over here now this one doesn't show up

426
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,040
because it was rewritten by the sdg um

427
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,680
but if the scg doesn't rewrite it um

428
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,120
you'll get a little icon that will show

429
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,199
you know a little uh word document or a

430
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,800
little powerpoint document which which

431
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,279
is super nice and that really helps

432
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,880
now these are relatively trivial

433
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,360
bypasses and a more properly configured

434
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,680
sdg can probably pick up on these things

435
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,199
pretty easily

436
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,760
but there is a more generic bypass which

437
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,199
we're also going to leverage another

438
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,920
microsoft product azure um to take

439
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,800
advantage of um so as we mentioned

440
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,360
before the sdgs tend to inspect files

441
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,000
and even downloaded uh files from links

442
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,639
and redirects but sdgs may not be able

443
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,920
to get past any form of user interaction

444
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,240
so if something must be clicked if it's

445
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,880
not an automatic redirection some sdgs

446
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,120
just go and look say oh this is where

447
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,199
i'm stopping at this page looks fine

448
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,360
send it forward and it gets sent

449
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,800
so things like captchas or an otp and

450
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,680
entry or something along those lines

451
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,079
can actually stop sdgs from checking for

452
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,240
any additional malicious files and this

453
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,720
provides us with the path to bypass

454
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,800
so here's an example using something

455
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,560
called google firebase yes i know this

456
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,160
is microsoft we're using google here

457
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,560
just let me have this one okay guys um

458
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,360
so google firebase is a really easy way

459
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,360
to deploy um uh to deploy uh a captcha

460
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,279
it's got a pretty easily integrated

461
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,639
process you can google it it's pretty

462
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,720
straightforward um and azure blob

463
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,959
storage is an opportunity to serve

464
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,199
direct downloads from a legitimate url

465
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,279
again we're using uh from that azure

466
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,160
based url and a lot of you know proxies

467
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,720
and sdgs that are looking at a url uh

468
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,600
probably are going to find that

469
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,800
legitimate because there's probably

470
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,639
going to be other uh legit files that

471
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,759
users are accessing from links of that

472
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,399
nature so the steps to execute this are

473
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,000
pretty straightforward actually you make

474
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,160
a firebase app generate the recaptcha

475
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,560
keys for your app uh you add the keys

476
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,199
and logic firebase that's needed pretty

477
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,040
straightforward process and then you

478
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,440
create azure blob storage with a public

479
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,279
read access

480
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,040
once you've done that you'll obviously

481
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,720
upload your um

482
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,399
file in there so that you know people

483
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,240
can download it and they know how to

484
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,720
redirect the blob storage specifically

485
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,599
that uh that exploit that malicious file

486
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,599
that you want to download um into the

487
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,439
url redirect so when a user goes in and

488
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,760
gets the email well the sdg will look at

489
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,599
it see the captcha they can't interact

490
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,199
with anywhere it's going all right this

491
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,119
looks good to me nothing weird going on

492
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,439
here the user will get it

493
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,280
open the link and see the captcha

494
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,559
they'll click through the captcha

495
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,000
they'll go to the regular site and

496
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,919
they'll be automatically down they'll

497
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,440
automatically download

498
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,640
that malicious file so from there

499
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,640
we get profit because now we have

500
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,240
beacons for days which is awesome so

501
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,320
that's kind of some of the more advanced

502
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,000
side of things and kind of moving away

503
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,960
from o365 ms 365 and more on the

504
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,799
insurance side but that's not all you

505
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,799
can do with insurer because shaw's got a

506
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,120
really cool uh bypass that we can

507
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,039
utilize in the azure product as well so

508
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,960
i'm gonna hand it over to microsoft shop

509
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,240
thanks sam

510
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,440
so uh in this bypass we're using azure

511
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,240
information protection to bypass secure

512
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,960
email gateways so what azure information

513
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,960
protection basically is

514
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,679
previously it was called uh rights

515
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,440
management services uh and uh for an

516
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,440
on-prem on-prem active directory it's

517
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,799
called active direct rights managing

518
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:19,840
service

519
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,160
uh this basically is a unified labeling

520
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,760
technique for classification and

521
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,400
protection of organizational data

522
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,200
uh it uses microsoft rights management

523
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,640
services to encrypt emails and

524
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,840
attachments

525
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,440
uh you can restrict the emails and

526
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,400
attachments to specific targets you can

527
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,280
uh

528
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,120
not only send your emails and

529
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,039
attachments to insider to

530
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,640
to people inside your organization but

531
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,960
outside your organization set an ex

532
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,720
expiry time for emails and attachments

533
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,559
so that your attachment that you're

534
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,240
sending the malicious attachment is no

535
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,080
longer available or after a certain

536
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,280
period of time

537
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,640
you can track uh the attachments like uh

538
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,160
when the victim

539
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,000
saw the email when he clicked on the

540
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,320
attachment when he opened the attachment

541
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,200
how many users clicked on the the links

542
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,039
or the attachment

543
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,000
itself

544
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,400
and another thing that you can do is uh

545
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,120
you can revoke the access at any time

546
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,240
that you need

547
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,640
and it's easy setup if you already use

548
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,799
azure you just log into your uh

549
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,960
microsoft 365 admin center from there

550
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,960
you go to information rights management

551
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,200
and there you can create your labels

552
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,559
and uh

553
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,080
yeah that's only that's it so

554
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,280
why should we use aip to bypass security

555
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,760
email security gateways because let's be

556
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,440
honest payload delivery is a pain in the

557
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,960
part but

558
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,799
we have azure information protection

559
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,720
with us ready to serve our payload to

560
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,280
our victims

561
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,320
so some advantages of using aip to

562
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,640
bypass segs

563
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,480
as i already mentioned you can track

564
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,640
your sent emails see when email was

565
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,200
viewed open the your emails are

566
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,960
encrypted your payloads are interrupted

567
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,080
even if you

568
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,799
uh upload your mail talk to virustotal

569
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:05,280
it wouldn't be able to identify it as a

570
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,039
malicious document because

571
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,760
the payload the mail dock is encrypted

572
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,760
and uh it cannot read the encrypted

573
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,799
format

574
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,600
you have access revocation like

575
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,919
you want to revoke the access you saw in

576
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:18,720
the

577
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,280
uh dashboard that your victim has

578
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,520
clicked on the link it has download

579
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,840
they have downloaded the attachment and

580
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,320
you do not want it to redistribute so

581
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,360
you can

582
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,520
you know you can even set uh do not

583
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,840
forward

584
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,919
uh feature in outlook when user when

585
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,240
you're using aip so that the emails are

586
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,640
not forwarded and when you get a call

587
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,559
back from the from your malicious

588
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,559
document you can use the access

589
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,440
revocation so the as the user

590
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,880
will have uh his access revoked and it

591
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,240
not only supports ms office file formats

592
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,159
it supports a variety of

593
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,080
file formats like for example it

594
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,240
supports pdfs it supports jpegs it

595
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,600
supports text files and once you encrypt

596
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,000
uh the file using aip

597
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,400
a little p gets added in the extension

598
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,840
of the file name

599
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,320
so uh

600
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,919
how does this work basically aip works

601
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:16,960
uh

602
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,520
when you add encryption to your files

603
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,720
uh

604
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,400
it

605
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,760
for when you and when you send the

606
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,720
malicious document to the victim it if

607
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,080
if it's using uh azure 80 it will go to

608
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,480
azure look for the credentials and since

609
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,400
azure is a single sign on service you

610
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,559
won't have to sign in uh

611
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,640
or enter your credentials but

612
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,960
it will go to azure look for credentials

613
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,480
find that the credentials match for the

614
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,320
email that i have specific i as an

615
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,159
attacker have specified for the

616
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,520
attachment meant to be and if if the

617
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,520
credentials match the email address then

618
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,320
it will uh give you the access to

619
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,200
my

620
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,400
give you the access to my malicious

621
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,120
document and then the document will be

622
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,559
downloaded

623
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,240
uh and uh another thing that if you uh

624
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,559
if if you don't have a microsoft azure

625
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,520
office 365 account either it will ask

626
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,320
you to ask you to create an o365 account

627
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,000
on azure or if you can even send uh

628
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,320
the encrypted files on a gmail or a

629
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,559
hotmail service and this

630
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,039
for this it will generate a special link

631
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,200
because of the collaboration between

632
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,000
microsoft and other email clients

633
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,799
uh the only limitation that i found when

634
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,480
using aip was when you're using

635
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,559
uh

636
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,640
when you're using eip to encrypt files

637
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,120
other than mms office files

638
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,440
and aip gui client is required to view

639
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,640
those encrypted files

640
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,039
so

641
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,120
this is an example of a recent

642
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,960
engagement that i did

643
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,919
i used aip for my plo delivery i created

644
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,640
uh sensitivity sensitivity labels in my

645
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,200
ms admin center and prepared a mail doc

646
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,000
with the macros enabled and applied the

647
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,919
confidential label to protect it the

648
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,559
payload was totally encrypted i you can

649
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:09,840
alternatively

650
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,080
alternatively encrypt your mailbox using

651
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,320
the eip gui client as well and you can

652
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,080
set cuts custom permissions like when

653
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,159
you want the access to be revoked when

654
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,559
you uh who you want to specifically

655
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,600
target your uh who do who you want to

656
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,919
specifically set your target as

657
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,520
and uh

658
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,919
yeah i did both of them i sent out an

659
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,840
encrypted email i sent out an encrypted

660
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,400
payload it bypassed all the segs and it

661
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,080
landed in the

662
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,200
victims inbox i got a call back and

663
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,279
this is it from my side happy fishing

664
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,600
guys

665
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,000
awesome well that's going to bring us to

666
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,919
the close of our presentation

667
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,159
you can see our uh linkedin and

with us uh on either of those platforms

670
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,320
i probably speak for both when i say we

671
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,320
love talking security and especially red

672
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,919
teaming so if you want to connect talk

673
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,600
about that we're happy to have you to

674
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,279
talk to anyone who's interested

675
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,440
uh but yeah i think that's going to end

676
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,480
it for us uh beer farmers welcome back

677
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,200
question mark

678
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,520
okay

679
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,520
thanks man and and i would call this

680
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,600
talk the most disconcerting thing i've

681
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,840
seen in a while

682
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,799
like massive uh congratulations on

683
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,200
figuring this stuff out and uh hopefully

684
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,520
making the world a better place agreed

685
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,760
and and it should scare

686
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,440
yeah um infosec teams globally because

687
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,360
the higher the high adoption rates and i

688
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,440
consider myself in that group

689
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,000
of the of microsoft 365

690
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,799
is

691
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:41,840
it's

692
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,840
it's mushrooming right globally yeah

693
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,120
because there's a false sense of

694
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,279
security is what we just learned at beer

695
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,520
con 3. i think there is and i think a

696
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,760
lot of people that deploy 365 maybe

697
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,200
assume that

698
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,039
it comes out of the box

699
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,200
that's cloud in general yeah i have this

700
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,440
assumption that someone else's thing so

701
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,640
therefore it's going to be someone

702
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,320
else's responsibility yeah

703
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,760
yeah and i would i would real yeah

704
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,000
you're right i work really closely with

705
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,159
my team works really closely with our

706
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,320
365 integration team

707
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,640
and the there is a lot of work to do to

708
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,200
get to even a small level of security

709
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,840
assurance inside that ecosystem so

710
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,320
yes it's fantastically interesting

711
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,640
so i think i think we'll wrap with that

712
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,720
one um

713
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,799
