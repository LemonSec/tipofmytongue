1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,800
my name is sonia which probably was the

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,880
very first thing you would have saw on

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,879
that card but

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,000
uh let me just open up my slide and that

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,440
will take it from there

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,390
just present it

7
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:17,520
[Music]

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,480
and i am hoping you guys are seeing

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,119
the slide so let's start with the

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,599
shinigami of the cyber world before we

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,240
get into it a little bit about me it

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,279
would be that my name is sonia which is

13
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,360
quite obvious and i have a bachelor's

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,680
degree in computer sciences now

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,920
see when i did my bachelor's i wanted to

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,559
be mark zuckerberg i thought that guy

17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,040
has figured it all out and then i

18
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,200
realized that i actually care about data

19
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,039
privacy of others so

20
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,719
that was a no-no

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,960
and then i wanted to sound a little bit

22
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,440
you know smart so i dabbled a little bit

23
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,360
in blockchain just to sound super

24
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,960
amazing during social gatherings and

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,600
yeah but then when i started doing it i

26
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,640
realized it was actually super fun

27
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,960
uh just a little bit about what i'm

28
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,040
currently focusing on is

29
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,080
cyber

30
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,200
terrorism i love in that topic i think

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,040
it has a lot of things that we need to

32
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,600
discuss and talk about and research

33
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,680
other than that i love doing advanced

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,920
persistent threats researching them

35
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,920
studying about them

36
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,159
hoping one day i would be smart enough

37
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,040
to figure out the code uh yeah that's a

38
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,920
struggle and hopefully we'll get there

39
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,439
and security regulations by profession i

40
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,640
am a cyber security analyst

41
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,479
and i love doing my job my way of just

42
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,000
going to the office and helping

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,840
businesses out that's something i love

44
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,799
doing

45
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,079
and at night i am pac-man i wanted to be

46
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,720
one i couldn't so i'm a student in cyber

47
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,240
security

48
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,399
studying all that that i just said

49
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,159
before

50
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,560
that's pretty much my story

51
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,360
uh let's move to the

52
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,960
shinigami in question

53
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,280
so

54
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,400
shinigami is basically from something

55
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,640
that's from japanese mythology which

56
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,520
means a spirit that calls you or invites

57
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,760
you towards death now the cyber

58
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,160
shinigami which is

59
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,440
is literally

60
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,239
the cyber version of an actual shinigami

61
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,080
from a show called that note but we

62
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,160
don't have time for that so let's just

63
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,760
stick to you

64
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,319
ryuk is a malware that is something

65
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,560
which i find interesting about review is

66
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,360
that

67
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,440
not a lot of people talk about it yet

68
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,120
it's quite

69
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,000
relevant in the media of cyber security

70
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,319
a lot of people were attacked by it

71
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,920
so how did it all begin and what it does

72
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,760
is something that we will be discovering

73
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,879
in today's

74
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,319
slide and

75
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,239
talk basically

76
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,840
so it was august 2018

77
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,680
and in that what happened was

78
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,680
there was an attack on a organization a

79
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,720
u.s

80
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,440
government organization and the attack

81
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,319
was done in a manner where the

82
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,440
resemblance of the attack was of some

83
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,879
malware called hermes now hermes is a

84
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,280
georgian ransomware and it was

85
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,480
discovered in 2017.

86
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,360
the attack and its resemblance towards

87
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,519
hermione was so similar that people

88
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:34,480
thought that

89
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,879
ryuk wasn't even a malware it was just a

90
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,640
new variant of hermes which

91
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,360
then we kind of discovered down the line

92
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,280
wasn't the case

93
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,159
now just a little bit about hermes

94
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,120
is that it's a trojan ransomware it's

95
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,400
most famously targeted banking

96
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,319
infrastructures

97
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,360
and it's the way of deception was not

98
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,879
only encryption but it would always

99
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,000
append the file encrypted with the dot

100
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,799
hermes uh extension this is where you

101
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,840
can actually identify the malware hermes

102
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,599
malware attacked your sister

103
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,079
now hermes is readily available on

104
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,478
underground forums if you know where to

105
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:19,519
look

106
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,798
and

107
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,160
this is where

108
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,199
when the attacks from the eu started to

109
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,479
increase people realize that the

110
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,759
actual malware that was lurking

111
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,160
was ryuk and not hermes

112
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,040
earlier versions that i just said were

113
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,840
very similar to

114
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,639
hermes of ryuk

115
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,280
and the actual unveiling of the

116
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,080
shinigami happened in 2018

117
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,560
to be exact it was around february

118
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,880
uh not sure the exact date but the year

119
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,840
was 2008.

120
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,800
um moving on a little bit more

121
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,280
so when we talk about who made some

122
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,639
malware especially in apd circle it's

123
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,199
very very hard to pinpoint exactly

124
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,000
who did what and where did it came from

125
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,080
however allegedly this malware for you

126
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,600
was developed by

127
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,919
wizard spider or they're also called

128
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,600
prince fighter and

129
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,120
whatever

130
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,800
they have a lot of names but they're

131
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,600
quite famously known as wizard spider

132
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,560
and they're a russian base group

133
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,520
they have been involved in multiple

134
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,720
attacks

135
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,440
and their most famous ransomware was

136
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,039
trickbot which you will find a little

137
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,800
bit more about

138
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,639
while we discuss

139
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,880
review because strict box and you have a

140
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,880
very close relation with each other

141
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,360
okay

142
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,199
so

143
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,320
the pandemic begins and the reason for

144
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,360
that is

145
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,479
i

146
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,720
wanted to divide this dog in not only

147
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,039
what for you case but how basically your

148
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,759
view gets into your system it's very

149
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,479
very important to know exactly

150
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,960
why something is happening instead of

151
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,720
how it's happening to avoid the

152
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,800
devastating mayhem it causes further

153
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,199
down the line

154
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,880
okay

155
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,000
so

156
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,319
when we talk about ryuk or any type of

157
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,639
malware in general there's always an

158
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,560
initial starting point

159
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,720
and most of that initial starting point

160
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,960
is either a phishing email

161
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,080
or a computer on the network that has

162
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,400
remote desktop protocol or any type of

163
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,319
remote protocol

164
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,560
that the attacker can exploit and get

165
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,120
access to that particular net node of

166
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,479
the network

167
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,800
in terms of review the samples that were

168
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,680
studied and the the research that i did

169
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,720
and literature that i found suggested

170
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,280
that most cases were you were phishing

171
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,240
emails

172
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,319
and in those phishing emails they were

173
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,120
either infected with a url

174
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,479
or a weaponized word document

175
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,759
it is immensely immensely

176
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,319
interesting for me that even in the year

177
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,840
2021

178
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,599
phishing emails are still a thing and

179
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:16,800
people are

180
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,199
avid victims of phishing

181
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,360
and that kind of goes to show that the

182
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,840
lack of cyber security awareness to a

183
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,720
very

184
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,720
ground bottom level

185
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,840
really really needs to be done

186
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,319
correctly uh phishing emails for you

187
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,960
or the sample server setting for you

188
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,360
consisted of when i said urls that were

189
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,800
infected

190
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,840
so basically these were urls that

191
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,759
triggered the download of eight dropper

192
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,840
malware which you will get into in a

193
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,280
couple of minutes

194
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,720
or a weaponized word document now to

195
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,400
people who might not know what a

196
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,720
weaponized word document is

197
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,039
a weaponized word document is something

198
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,080
that contains malicious macro code

199
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,800
there's these things in microsoft office

200
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,960
especially microsoft word called macro

201
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,520
code which really helps you to format

202
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,560
your

203
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,800
document and makes you do a lot of other

204
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,879
cool stuff and once those four have some

205
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,039
type of malicious

206
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,440
you know code inside of them

207
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,199
and the document opens it triggers a

208
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,520
download for you so both of these in

209
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,759
both of these cases either the url or

210
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,479
the recognized for talk what do they do

211
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:31,759
is that they

212
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,799
triggers a specific

213
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,120
download for a dropper malware

214
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,120
now let's get into what that dropper

215
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,640
malware is and what it does

216
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,959
awesome so

217
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,360
when we talk about a dropper malware

218
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,760
it's very very essential to explain what

219
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,800
it is

220
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,440
a dropper malware is a malware that

221
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,080
basically takes the actual

222
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,120
attack

223
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,640
malware

224
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,240
packages it and then delivers it to your

225
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,640
victim's machine so think of it as a

226
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,040
piece man a pizza man is carrying a

227
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,839
pizza for you no it doesn't matter if

228
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,160
the pizza is good or bad it just carries

229
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,839
it to you and then you open the box and

230
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,600
you figure out hey it has mushrooms and

231
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,760
olives and i didn't water that crap

232
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,519
i mean seriously if you're eating pizza

233
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,200
with mushrooms and all this you should

234
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,080
be in jail okay that's that's my verdict

235
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,120
on it

236
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,560
but uh

237
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,480
moving on a little so that's what a

238
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,240
dropper level does and in case of for

239
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,680
you

240
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,480
re before i go further in this i need to

241
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,080
really emphasize

242
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,920
that ryuk is a very ma manual mount it's

243
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,800
not automated it it doesn't work as

244
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,480
other malware it's a very

245
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,080
malmo malware and it needs you to first

246
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,920
clean out the way

247
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,680
so that it can actually do what it needs

248
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,720
to do

249
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,120
and that's where a dropper malware comes

250
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,399
in

251
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,200
so

252
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,240
in the samples where you studied a drop

253
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,680
of malware

254
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,519
there were two very common dropper

255
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,560
numbers so it was either tripod

256
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,480
and place loader

257
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,360
and

258
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,920
in some cases for you there wasn't any

259
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,399
dropper malware and i will tell you why

260
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,240
no they were sorry there was dropper

261
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,839
malware but there wasn't any

262
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,560
other payload involved for that dropper

263
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,680
number and we're going to get into it by

264
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,479
what i mean by that

265
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,480
so

266
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,880
let's get a little deeper on the dropper

267
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,880
malware aspect

268
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,680
so a dropper malware comes in

269
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,480
it

270
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,880
and it's triggered by either the url or

271
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,760
the weaponized word off

272
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,880
that proper wears malware gets into your

273
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,680
system now this is a very stealthy piece

274
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,320
of code it is designed to be hidden

275
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,240
and it is designed to have constant

276
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,360
communication with acnc or command and

277
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,959
control server

278
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,440
now there were two samples studied for

279
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,800
you one of them had a dropper malware

280
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,680
that was just doing what it needed to do

281
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,640
and then get re-downloaded into the

282
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,399
victim's machine

283
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,360
the other samples of ryuk what they did

284
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,760
was that the dropper malware was

285
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,240
downloaded into the victim's machine

286
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,839
then the cnc server was contacted and

287
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,640
that cnc server sent in another payload

288
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,800
that did what the dropper malware was

289
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,480
not able to do

290
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,440
again it really depends on what type of

291
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,480
dropper malware you are using what it is

292
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,519
what it can actually do and what it what

293
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,519
do you need it to do

294
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,399
sometimes it's very very important

295
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,279
in any of these attacks the time is of

296
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,120
the essence and the art of being hidden

297
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,160
is excruciatingly important because if

298
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,920
you're attacking and while you're attack

299
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,160
you're exposed that attack can be

300
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,760
stopped

301
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,040
so

302
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,000
we move to the next slide

303
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,120
so this is a little chart that has been

304
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,240
developed and it kind of shows you the

305
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,680
life cycle of what is done in order to

306
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,240
achieve that download from you

307
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,480
so you get a dropper malware

308
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,000
you drop it

309
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,360
onto

310
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,600
the victim's machine the dropper member

311
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,639
then connects to a cnc server one of the

312
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,200
samples suggested that cnc server was a

313
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,360
forbode strike server

314
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,160
then the kubo strike server sends in a

315
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,839
malicious payload or ver very amazingly

316
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,399
called a bacon so it sends a bacon a

317
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,320
bacon is basically a payload and a

318
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,320
payload is any malicious code that is

319
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,880
there to do something that needs to be

320
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,360
done in order to get further access into

321
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,600
that network

322
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,000
then the bacon starts reaching the

323
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,079
system this is where

324
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,279
the

325
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,839
payload starts disabling your antivirus

326
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,680
programs it starts stealing your

327
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,959
credentials it starts moving your

328
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,279
network laterally until it reaches the

329
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,760
main controller of that network

330
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,320
what is a domain controller if somebody

331
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,839
you have this question well the domain

332
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,920
controller is think of it as the big

333
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,519
daddy of all that is on the network it

334
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,760
controls everything that's going on to

335
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,200
that network from passwords to users to

336
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,600
ip addresses it has every single thing

337
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,160
and it can also decide the privilege

338
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,079
each user needs to have

339
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,160
in those networks

340
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,720
and then lastly once that

341
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,079
bacon

342
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,920
or dropper malware reaches to that

343
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,199
domain controller section it then

344
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,240
triggers

345
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,639
the download of ryuk from the command

346
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,800
and control server one thing that needs

347
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,839
to be

348
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,040
really emphasized in this entire cycle

349
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,839
is

350
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,839
whether you're using a dropper malware

351
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,240
or the dropper malware is then asking

352
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,560
the command and control server to send

353
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,920
in a bacon

354
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,240
in either of these cases

355
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,959
the communication between the dropper

356
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,639
malware and the command and control is

357
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,839
going to exist there's nothing in this

358
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,920
of that sort that i just download

359
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,079
something and suddenly once it's in my

360
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,320
system it stops communicating to this

361
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,360
origin

362
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,079
that i mean if that communication stops

363
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,839
the further invest

364
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,920
the further basically the further mayhem

365
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,079
or the further domino effect

366
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,199
will

367
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,079
not resist for too long

368
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,639
and for a good attack you need to make

369
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,720
sure that the attacker

370
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,440
which basically is somebody controlling

371
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,079
from the command and control point has

372
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,560
continuous information about the

373
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,399
exploitation happening as it's happening

374
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,199
so

375
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,279
we move a little bit

376
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,160
more

377
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,279
uh in this section of the pandemic

378
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,720
so

379
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,639
we discussed the whole strike bacon

380
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,720
that's at the length now i want to

381
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,240
discuss something

382
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,720
uh that i found quite interesting while

383
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,519
my research was that there were samples

384
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,920
of ryu that didn't

385
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,720
require a whole strike taken or any

386
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,120
further payloads in fact the dropper

387
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,440
malware that were used in previous

388
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,360
samples or even some later samples of

389
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,199
ryu were trickbot and emote the s load

390
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,399
laser was also there but i want to talk

391
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,279
a little bit on trigbot and remote

392
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,959
and

393
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,279
the reason for that is is that the

394
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,040
malware they are

395
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,600
standalone malwares themselves so it's

396
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,519
it's not like they're just some

397
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,120
some sort of bacon or some very specific

398
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,040
payload they're very specific but they

399
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,079
are standalone hardware themselves so uh

400
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,720
the way they kind of interact with the

401
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,040
exploitation phase is something i find

402
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,880
so very interesting

403
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,680
and the way that they do it

404
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,880
is that

405
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,639
uh

406
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,639
emote and tripod have special features

407
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,839
if we

408
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,360
uh talk a little bit about tripod

409
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,720
trigpot has the speciality that it can

410
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,560
very rapidly

411
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,040
uh it can very rapidly

412
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,000
disable your endpoint security software

413
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,040
it has it's actually known to do that in

414
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,680
fact this was a malware that

415
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,000
specific was a georgian malware that

416
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,480
specifically did wire frauds

417
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,639
uh for financial institutions around the

418
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,800
world and the very

419
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,120
way that it did it was that it got into

420
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,199
their system disabled the endpoint

421
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,720
security and then did what it had to do

422
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,680
uh when

423
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,920
when we talk about remote emote is much

424
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,399
more uh i feel like it's much more

425
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,880
clever than trick god because while it

426
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,519
does what tripod does it also have this

427
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,959
thing where

428
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,919
it can detect a sandboxing environment

429
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,760
and since all of these malwares are

430
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,520
communicating directly with the command

431
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,359
and control server

432
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,919
once the motor is in your system and it

433
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,160
detects it's in in sandboxing

434
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,480
environment it lays dormant

435
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,000
it doesn't do anything it doesn't

436
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
communicate it just lays dormant which

437
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,679
makes it highly highly highly invisible

438
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,480
and it gives the attacker enough time to

439
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,799
get the hell out of there without having

440
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,200
any active trace

441
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,840
and emote can also actually detect

442
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,879
virtual machine environments as well so

443
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:43,840
the

444
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,640
reuk when they were done through proper

445
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,520
malware such as mode or drinkbot

446
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,039
they have these

447
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,000
very specific routes that they took

448
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,880
almost like the attackers kind of really

449
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,720
knew what they were doing

450
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,480
and while researching a lot under you i

451
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,720
found out that a lot of time

452
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,840
uh the insider's threat

453
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,360
was the major cause of a lot of mouth

454
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,400
and i'm not pointing any fingers to on

455
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,120
anybody because i don't know but

456
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,960
the research really suggests that a lot

457
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,080
of them the malware exploitation cycle

458
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,480
is really really dependent on how much

459
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,120
the attacker knows about the

460
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,640
infrastructure

461
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,720
and most of the time that knowledge of

462
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,240
infrastructure is coming from the

463
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,360
insider actor now this could be a row

464
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,600
employee or it could simply be some

465
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,600
attacker going into the premises and

466
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,799
getting

467
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,720
connected to that infrastructure and

468
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,880
just you know

469
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,880
taking all that information and

470
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,559
extracting it out

471
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:49,679
so

472
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,760
in any cyber security attack in fact

473
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,000
reconnaissance plays a very very

474
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,320
important role and i feel like a lot of

475
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,679
times when we're talking about

476
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,880
reconnaissance we consistently think of

477
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,720
it as a very since it's a very

478
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,080
non-technical phase of the cycle

479
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,919
it's not that important or it doesn't

480
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,200
have any

481
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,320
work doing but good posting or good

482
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,640
reconnaissance can really help you make

483
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,880
or break something

484
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,640
so this is a little bit on that

485
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,880
moving on

486
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,200
again this slide is literally telling

487
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,039
you what i just said

488
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:31,280
a few slides ago emote is a very very

489
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,880
clever malware and again it gets into

490
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,840
your system it detects what it is it

491
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,640
moves laterally it steals credentials it

492
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,880
gets to the domain controller and then

493
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,280
it triggers the download of ryuk in that

494
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,200
particular machine

495
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,600
so enough on a mode let's move on

496
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,160
so this slide is my favorite slide

497
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,480
because this is where we're going to get

498
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,039
really really deep into the uk as deep

499
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,440
as i can get in 15 minutes i wanted to

500
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,159
make sure this the stock is

501
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,559
technical as well as digestible for

502
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,679
folks so that not everybody feel left

503
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:10,720
out

504
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,960
so let's start and analyze the mayhem

505
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,840
okay

506
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,600
so one thing i want to really really

507
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,440
emphasize is that

508
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,400
i've designed this in a manner where i'm

509
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,640
explaining certain topics which may come

510
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,919
across as very basic but i think it is

511
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,640
required if it requires an explanation

512
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,720
because that will really help everybody

513
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,559
understand every single thing that's

514
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:39,840
going on

515
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,640
so

516
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,080
now your dropper malware or your

517
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,880
cs bacon is in the domain controller it

518
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,960
triggers a download for review and it

519
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,400
downloads

520
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,440
what does it do next well the one thing

521
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,559
ryuk

522
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,559
does it's it

523
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,559
does anti-disassembly

524
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,120
and anti-debugging

525
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,440
why what is led assembly and

526
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,840
anti-deposit well

527
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,679
entity assembly

528
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,400
is when

529
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,760
you have

530
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,360
your

531
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,640
source port and you have static and

532
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,720
tools that analyze that source

533
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,559
if you have that

534
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,000
the assembly

535
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,880
that

536
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,440
prevents any kind of tool to analyze

537
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,400
your source port why does ryu does it

538
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,120
well ryuk is essentially a program it

539
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,679
has a source code and it doesn't want

540
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,480
anything to analyze any of its

541
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,720
weaknesses or flaws or its source code

542
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,960
so the very first thing

543
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,640
it does is that it protects its binaries

544
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,840
from being analyzed by any kind of tool

545
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,159
and the next thing that it does is it

546
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,000
enables anti

547
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,200
debugging

548
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,559
and again

549
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,200
both of these are tools both of these

550
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,000
techniques are simultaneously used to

551
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,840
re-reverse engineer some type of source

552
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,640
code

553
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,520
once both of these aspects are disabled

554
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,280
or are some or

555
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,280
or are in a state where they cannot be

556
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,480
utilized

557
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,320
ryuk is somewhat at ease that okay now i

558
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,960
can do my you know damage

559
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,919
in peace nobody's there nagging

560
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,000
and that's what is that that is the

561
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
reason why this is the very very first

562
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,960
thing you've done

563
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,480
okay

564
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,679
so

565
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,120
the next thing

566
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,919
what i really wanted to focus on

567
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,120
was

568
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,159
how this review does it how does do you

569
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,159
do anti-data assembly

570
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,000
and anti-debugging

571
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
well there's something called windows

572
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,280
api

573
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,640
and there might be a question that is

574
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,640
something that is only

575
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,799
penetrated in windows systems no there

576
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,520
are linux and other oss but the samples

577
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,600
that i studied during my research were

578
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,760
window machines so that's what we're

579
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,000
talking from a windows perspective

580
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,880
so windows api what is it

581
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,960
and why is it important for this stock

582
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,000
well

583
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,720
the reason windows api is important is

584
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,520
that

585
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,679
anti-disassembly

586
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,559
and anti-debugging disabling these two

587
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,080
things

588
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,480
is done through the manipulation of

589
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,080
windows api

590
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,679
and

591
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,600
to understand

592
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,600
how it's done you need to understand

593
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,640
what windows api is so window api is

594
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,919
basically

595
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,559
a interface that allows user written

596
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,520
programs to interact with the windows os

597
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,480
kernel

598
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,919
so a little bit on os 101 the kernel is

599
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,080
the core component of any operating

600
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,200
system

601
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,320
and

602
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,679
everything around the kernel is what

603
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,840
makes the whole operating system as what

604
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,000
you can see on your machine

605
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,840
everything interacts with the kernel and

606
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,320
then the kernel interacts interacts back

607
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,159
to it and that's how the whole process

608
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,240
of you using stuff what

609
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,039
the reason for a lot of reuse operations

610
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,960
are dependent on the manipulation of

611
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,880
windows api

612
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,240
and

613
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,840
why is it manipulating windows api is

614
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,159
because window api is

615
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,480
necessarily focusing on using written

616
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,960
program this means endpoint security

617
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,360
software is also there any type of

618
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,000
backup software is also there so that

619
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,799
manipulation can really help review

620
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,360
disable all of those softwares do what

621
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,000
it needs to do and get the hell out well

622
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,159
it doesn't necessarily get out it just

623
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,799
encrypts everything so it just stays

624
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,159
there but

625
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,559
that is why we use windows api

626
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,320
okay so i have five minutes left so i

627
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,279
really need to rush this

628
00:24:55,279 --> 00:25:00,000
okay so review copy itself three times

629
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,880
when the current directory it exists

630
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,799
the first copy

631
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,320
triggers a command line that is

632
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,120
responsible for self-replication

633
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,679
of the files that it started

634
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,840
the second and the third top copy

635
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,279
triggers the

636
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,159
wake on land packet now wake on land

637
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:19,279
packet

638
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,960
is actually a industry level protocol

639
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,520
that sends a packet to every system on

640
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,720
your network to basically power up in a

641
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,120
very low power state

642
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,720
before review

643
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,799
and this is done so that this so that

644
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,279
the malware can spread across the entire

645
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,720
network

646
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,840
so before you start an encryption it

647
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,919
stops certain processes and services

648
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,080
these service numbers and process

649
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,400
numbers may increase and decrease

650
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,840
however the

651
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,679
actual loan and counted are 41 processes

652
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,760
and i think around

653
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,440
64

654
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,000
services either way you guys can see it

655
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,600
on the slides

656
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,679
so the reason for stopping these

657
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,600
services

658
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,159
is because most of these services or

659
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:11,279
processes

660
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,880
are either backup services anti-viruses

661
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,760
some type of service that a file is

662
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,039
utilizing

663
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,520
so that's there again a simple

664
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,640
difference

665
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,640
or basically differentiating between the

666
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,480
two what is the service and what is the

667
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,840
process

668
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,880
a

669
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,440
process is an instance of an executable

670
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,559
file or any file that has a dot exe

671
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,960
a service is something that is

672
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,400
running on the background is

673
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,720
communicating with the os kernel so that

674
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,840
your os system can work properly

675
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,279
okay

676
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,679
moving a little bit further

677
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,640
uh we have uh

678
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,640
a little bit what do you does once it

679
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,279
starts in picture so it encrypts both

680
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:58,000
your network drive and your local drive

681
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,039
every encrypted folder will have an uh

682
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,200
ransom note at the end

683
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,159
and

684
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,279
if there is an index file which is also

685
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:08,200
normally

686
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,760
index.html

687
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,880
it will

688
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,240
append the html ransom node because the

689
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,799
ransom node is essentially an html file

690
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,120
so it will just bend that code into this

691
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,399
file if it finds a php file it does the

692
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,200
same thing it renders the php4 so it

693
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,399
renders the html4 into a php code

694
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,120
and the reason why it does that is that

695
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,000
some researchers suggest that there were

696
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,200
websites or public facing html pages on

697
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,000
certain machines and so you want to also

698
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,399
deface the website while it's encrypting

699
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:45,039
you in the back end

700
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,960
ryuk uses a

701
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,480
encryption key of which is generated

702
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,360
from a window api called trip gen key

703
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,120
that key is uh

704
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,000
a aes 256 bit

705
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,600
and that is a symmetric encryption

706
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,799
uh key

707
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,480
and that encryption key is then

708
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,760
encrypted further within rsa key which

709
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,919
is a asymmetric introduction

710
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,720
at this point

711
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,720
once all of these files are encrypted

712
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,640
and then re-encrypted

713
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,799
the damage is done there's nothing you

714
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,919
can do about it it's better to say rip

715
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,120
and

716
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,880
pay the ransom

717
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,360
and that is pretty much however you kind

718
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,399
of gets into your system destroys it and

719
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:35,600
then laughs at your face

720
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,360
some media appearances that the youth

721
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,840
has made recently

722
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,399
and make and the victims

723
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,799
are on your screen there were other

724
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,880
multiple victims which were

725
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,279
either not known or were

726
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,320
con

727
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,960
were due to confidentiality reasons

728
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,399
not reported

729
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,960
so these are the names of those victims

730
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,399
as you can see most of them are

731
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,720
government agencies

732
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,720
moving down

733
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,399
the final slide

734
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:05,840
i don't like

735
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,279
talking about a problem without

736
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,520
providing some type of solution

737
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,640
so

738
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,559
as an analyst and as somebody who's

739
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,039
working in the industry i think there

740
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:18,080
are three most common ways which you can

741
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,640
do to avoid any type of malware or any

742
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,679
type of attack essentially number one

743
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,039
patch management do it every single

744
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,720
month if you have to

745
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,279
technology is rapidly rapidly

746
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,840
increasing its vector where the attack

747
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,880
surface is just phenomenally fake

748
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,760
so do that number two stop

749
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,760
any unnecessary thing that you're not

750
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,799
using

751
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,799
if it if those are ports if those are

752
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:47,200
services if those are software stop them

753
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,000
delete them uninstall them get rid of

754
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,919
them there's no point of having them in

755
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,480
your pc if you're not using that

756
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,360
last and certainly not the least cyber

757
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,120
security awareness

758
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,279
and endpoint security

759
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,120
you can not

760
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,360
uh i think the best investment any

761
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,640
company can ever make is actually giving

762
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,760
your users the education on how to

763
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,480
handle technology and what to do and

764
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,159
what not to do

765
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,640
and also buy an endpoint security

766
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,000
product that is specifically there to

767
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,799
solve your company's problems not don't

768
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:27,120
follow a fair trend that this one is top

769
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,520
and this one isn't use your brain it's

770
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,240
the best tool you can ever have

771
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,760
and

772
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,679
this concludes my 50 minutes of

773
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,000
review shinigami talk

774
