1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,320
um today i'm going to be talking about

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,600
air and cyber security from the attack

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,919
and defense perspective

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,800
but before that um a little about me my

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,200
name is rachel okoji and um the first

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,759
thing you need to know about me is

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,240
i'm a total noob so

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,439
please go easy on me and

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,240
i'm nigerian as well and definitely not

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,000
related to nigerian prince

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,159
i'm interested in a and cyber security

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,520
and i've been trying to get my skills up

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,840
using online platforms

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,920
and try to break into the industry as

15
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,879
well

16
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,440
i love oceans and every now and then i

17
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,320
participate and uh oh

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,600
trace labs um search party event

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,399
and uh holy yeah

20
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,640
yes so technically this is my first

21
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,079
speaking engagement and i say

22
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,879
technically because i spoke at isolation

23
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,280
con hexi and infosec

24
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,319
but i did those with my mentor dominique

25
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,519
and

26
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,080
i mostly hid behind him the whole time

27
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,159
so this is me

28
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,159
breaking out on my own into the big bad

29
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,119
world

30
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,479
so oh nice yeah

31
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:17,680
um

32
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,159
so yeah i found a near perfect name for

33
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,119
my presentation um

34
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,840
this

35
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,960
um well i would like to say we're going

36
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,159
into the future and yes in future but um

37
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,640
i think ai is here already so i don't

38
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,119
know about using the word future

39
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,320
um we have ai we have self-driving cars

40
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,079
we have air and vr

41
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,439
so basically futures here and it's both

42
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,759
it's terrifying and it's exciting at the

43
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,880
same time

44
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,960
um

45
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,680
so yeah just a little bit about ai first

46
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,680
of all artificial intelligence is

47
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,680
basically a collective term

48
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,600
used to describe the machine's

49
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,719
capability to sense comprehend and learn

50
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,360
like we do

51
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,000
ai is capable of speech image and video

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,120
recognition augmented creativity

53
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,840
smart automation advanced simulation

54
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,680
complex analytics

55
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,360
predictions and blah blah blah

56
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,200
so under ai uh we have machine learning

57
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,840
which is basically a subset of ai

58
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,040
um

59
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,360
it's basically machines being able to

60
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,680
operate without being explicitly

61
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,160
programmed machine learning systems

62
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,480
constantly learn with the data they're

63
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,200
provided and um

64
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,120
we also have deep learning which is a

65
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,840
subset of machine learning it's a more

66
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,239
advanced form of machine learning in the

67
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,760
sense that um it works with all

68
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,840
designed to mimic the working of the

69
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,200
human brain

70
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,080
um

71
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,000
which basically they're called neural

72
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,239
networks they operate like the human

73
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,959
brain and they require

74
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,080
almost

75
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,280
no human

76
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,920
inter intervention they just keep

77
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,720
learning that way

78
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,680
anyway um what does ai have to do with

79
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,000
cyber security

80
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,239
um ai can efficiently process huge

81
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,360
volumes of data which is very essential

82
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,840
when it comes to cyber security when it

83
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,640
comes to protecting data because

84
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,000
that makes the process of

85
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,640
analyzing this data faster and more

86
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,799
effective

87
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,120
machine learning and deep learning can

88
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,879
be used to observe

89
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,280
patterns across networks and detect

90
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,159
anomalies and because they keep learning

91
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,440
it's a huge um

92
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,000
it's an important part in developing new

93
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,440
security

94
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,400
measures and new security tools as well

95
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,360
um

96
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,599
these systems need very little human

97
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,599
intervention like i said

98
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,640
and

99
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,159
in cases where there's a lack of

100
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,239
security teams which we notice in a lot

101
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,680
of places actually um ai can make up for

102
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,920
that

103
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,599
now

104
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,400
the attack perspective um machine

105
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,120
learning and deep learning are

106
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,160
great

107
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,199
but um

108
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,199
they're also great for attackers because

109
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,279
then they can make they can facilitate

110
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:21,918
it

111
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,199
they can facilitate faster targets

112
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,280
faster targeted and more sophisticated

113
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,840
cyber attacks and these attacks

114
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,479
obviously can have significantly higher

115
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,000
impact than

116
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,919
legacy attacks

117
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:36,960
um

118
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,360
so i'm just going to talk about a few um

119
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,840
ai in the enabled

120
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,919
cyber attacks

121
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,479
number one on the list of course

122
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,639
and enabled phishing attacks now

123
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,160
natural language processing in ai

124
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,560
makes it easier for attackers to create

125
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,720
vision emails that appear more

126
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,000
believable

127
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,759
and um there's a natural language

128
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,840
there's a language called gpt-3

129
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,160
basically gbt3 is able to analyze human

130
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,280
interactions from social media and how

131
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,840
people chat and everything and

132
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,120
put together

133
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,360
this information and

134
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,479
form

135
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:23,600
um

136
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,240
and and produce emails that look

137
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,960
believable it can personalize

138
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,280
information um

139
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,199
particular to a person

140
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,919
and send a phishing email which would

141
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,639
make it more possible for which will

142
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,680
make it

143
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,280
more believable for the person and the

144
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,560
person gets deceived and pressed linked

145
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,600
actually at defcon the singapore

146
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,360
government's

147
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,360
technology agency

148
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,520
they carried out a research where they

149
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,720
sent out

150
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,120
ai efficient emails to

151
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,280
about 200 colleagues

152
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,720
they sent out a couple of emails

153
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,120
including ai efficient emails and most

154
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,080
people clicked on the ai efficient

155
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,880
emails because it contained details that

156
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,360
you normally wouldn't find in

157
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,360
other official emails

158
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,319
these details were sourced from mostly

159
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,240
just social media and they were very

160
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,199
personalized

161
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,680
so next um

162
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,560
talking about botnet attacks

163
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,600
we saw what happened with sony with the

164
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,759
ps5

165
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,560
botnet attacks where they got sold out

166
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,880
almost immediately because people used

167
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,919
bots to purchase them but think about

168
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,560
that and think about it

169
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,240
with ai

170
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,600
enhancement

171
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,840
so

172
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,240
basically what happens is the attackers

173
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,560
introduce malicious code into this box

174
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,280
and then these bots are able to behave

175
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,960
like humans and it's difficult for this

176
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,199
website to

177
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,440
recognize that these are bots

178
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,039
um in 2018 taskrabbits their their

179
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,080
website for laborers and

180
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,120
clients

181
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,560
they suffered a massive security breach

182
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,160
which is facilitated by ai powered bots

183
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,599
and it resulted in

184
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:25,360
145 million compromised user data

185
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,680
including social security numbers and

186
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,440
bank details

187
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,360
there are a couple of other attacks that

188
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,720
have been recorded in similar fashion

189
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,560
but that's just an example of the kind

190
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,360
of attacks that can be powered by ai

191
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:42,800
so

192
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,599
reverse engineering of machine learning

193
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,639
model now um this

194
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,919
attackers usually do this using what is

195
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,199
called a model extraction attack where

196
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,520
they send queries repeatedly to the api

197
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,919
of the neural network of the machine

198
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,280
learning model

199
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,759
and when they receive responses they

200
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,400
gather these responses analyze it and

201
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,960
they're able to

202
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,120
reconstruct a similar model um

203
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,960
they're able to almost accurately

204
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,960
reconstruct the similar model

205
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,440
um of this machine learning model so um

206
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,800
when this happens

207
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,199
if this is successful it can really um

208
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,279
affect the integrity of this machine

209
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,958
learning models

210
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,559
and

211
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,519
it's

212
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,200
crazy

213
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,839
anyway um next

214
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,360
training data poisoning usually this

215
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,880
can happen if the attacker has access to

216
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,080
proprietary data um the trading data

217
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,839
specifically

218
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,880
it's usually an inside job and it

219
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,000
obviously

220
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,399
affects the integrity it alters the

221
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,279
machine learning model training data

222
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,959
basically the attacker forces the

223
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,560
machine to accept the poison data as

224
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,240
training data

225
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,760
and um

226
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,760
this actually takes a while poisoning

227
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,640
takes a while but if it's successful

228
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,519
um then the integrity of the machine is

229
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,000
totally compromised

230
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,320
now

231
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,399
finally um i want to talk about some

232
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,839
deep fakes deep fakes are

233
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,120
basically

234
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,240
um

235
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,839
a lot of people playing around with deep

236
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,920
fakes right now on social media tick

237
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,519
tock it's fun

238
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,200
um but they can also be used to

239
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,360
coordinate attacks they can be used to

240
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,839
pass around false information

241
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,800
and they can be used um in very

242
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,040
dangerous ways and politics and

243
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,880
everything so i just want to share this

244
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,080
fun video

245
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,880
um there's this

246
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,880
this is supposed to be tom cruise but

247
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,200
this is an ex excellent example of

248
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,600
feature

249
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,519
not sure we can hear the sound here

250
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,480
okay

251
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,800
now um that isn't tom cruise at all um

252
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,040
but it looks so much like him and that's

253
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,279
what um deep cakes can be used for they

254
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,720
can be used to

255
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,160
manipulate

256
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,079
videos and

257
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,519
pictures

258
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,360
to

259
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,839
look um a certain way they can also

260
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,639
imitate a mouth of movements and eye

261
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,639
movements and all that

262
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,360
this is a more extensive form of it

263
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,320
so moving on to the defense perspective

264
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,880
um if harnessed correctly ai can be a

265
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,839
very essential tool for creating

266
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,120
calculated and accurate security

267
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,760
solutions using automated decision

268
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,720
making and evaluation processes

269
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,839
the predictive nature of ai as well can

270
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,360
be used to predict potential attacks

271
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,639
using

272
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,839
patterns

273
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:48,959
ai

274
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,000
models

275
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,639
algorithms can study

276
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,440
what is a normal pattern and tell that

277
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,800
from an anomaly and with that it can

278
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,360
predict potential attacks and

279
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,120
prevent even zero-day attacks

280
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,399
so first of all ai sponsor filtering for

281
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,519
example

282
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,760
l a s bomb fit

283
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,800
ai spawn filtering like um

284
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,639
ai phishing

285
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,360
uses natural language processing

286
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,279
but this time around it

287
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,200
uses it to weed out fission emails

288
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,959
and it also comes with built-in

289
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,200
automated white listing and blacklisting

290
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,959
functions

291
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,360
these functions actually use the

292
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,920
algorithm they actually span filter

293
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,200
algorithm

294
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,079
to

295
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,160
filter out dangerous emails from um

296
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,399
from data that they've learned from from

297
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,920
past data

298
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,959
and

299
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,600
they also filter out

300
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,560
emails from untrusted sources like um

301
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,120
ip addresses that are suspicious or

302
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,199
websites that are suspicious or have

303
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,000
been marked as suspicious

304
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,959
and it can also detect malware embedded

305
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,800
in emails

306
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,800
in email attachments for example

307
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,480
another very effective way ai has been

308
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,639
applied to cyber security

309
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,800
is anomaly based

310
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,760
network intrusion and prevention

311
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,120
systems

312
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,800
intuition detection and prevention

313
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,320
systems

314
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,720
these systems use deep learning to

315
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,279
observe normal network behavior and

316
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,000
filter out what networks have unusual

317
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,120
behavior

318
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,079
um

319
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,040
the

320
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,240
what's different about these systems is

321
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,880
what's what um

322
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,720
the advantage they have about

323
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,120
signature-based um

324
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,639
ideas in ips systems is that they

325
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,320
continuously learn

326
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,519
and they self-adjust

327
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,480
this can be very important in predicting

328
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,440
and preventing zero-day attacks

329
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,040
and

330
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,800
next um

331
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,600
cyber threat intelligence reports

332
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,279
now um threats intelligence reports are

333
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,680
quite over can be quite overwhelming

334
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,839
especially now that their

335
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,079
attacks every day it's difficult to keep

336
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,279
up and

337
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,440
put together all this information and

338
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,880
analyze it

339
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,120
and now they are open source ai tools

340
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,199
that can automatically generate these

341
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,079
reports and save time and

342
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,480
save cost and

343
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,000
they're generally more

344
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,040
effective at

345
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,759
producing these reports and

346
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,320
um so people can update their security

347
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,360
systems and their security plans as well

348
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,120
um

349
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,279
just to conclude um

350
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,519
i'm not saying that ai is

351
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,600
100

352
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,959
it's a 100 solution for cyber security

353
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,880
well it's really important going forward

354
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,000
because what what better way to fight um

355
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,320
ai attack ai um enhance cyber attacks

356
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,240
than with machines

357
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,600
and um

358
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,279
of course we still need to work on

359
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,440
security awareness because i'm an

360
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,120
advocate for

361
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,440
people our first line of defense um

362
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,759
if we don't create that um

363
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,519
first line of defense if we don't

364
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,320
educate people about cyber security

365
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,120
and protect that first line of defense

366
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,519
then we are going to have issues

367
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,199
with um efficient attacks and

368
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,480
those at the

369
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,440
where

370
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,240
a lot we're opening ourselves up to

371
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,240
major attacks and everything so

372
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,440
that's all

373
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,759
thank you um is there any questions

374
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,639
thank you so much that was awesome

375
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,320
yeah awesome i was going to say if you

376
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,639
got like a contact sheet put that off

377
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,360
because that's that'd be great yeah and

378
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,599
the deep fake thing i i always

379
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,480
think about the potential applications

380
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,919
for deep fake

381
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,000
um and the tom cruise's example there

382
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,599
you could readily and it's there are

383
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,199
examples of it actually you could

384
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,520
readily imagine it to be used by

385
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,400
world leaders in propaganda but but

386
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,319
coercive and subversive propaganda

387
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,559
exercises and psyops i think there was

388
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,559
an obama one that there wasn't a battle

389
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,200
yeah a trump one as well and yeah

390
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,360
yeah and the minute that lands on social

391
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,600
media it was a wake up call but i don't

392
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,760
even think from that good lord like a

393
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,400
company suddenly the ceo is saying i

394
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,799
need all this data emailed to this this

395
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,520
thing on a video called something

396
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,320
suddenly have a way yeah or the ceo

397
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,080
sends somebody working in your in your

398
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,240
finance department a requirement to send

399
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,240
cash somewhere yeah it's

400
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,240
highly plausible yeah the scenarios are

401
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,280
amazing

402
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,280
