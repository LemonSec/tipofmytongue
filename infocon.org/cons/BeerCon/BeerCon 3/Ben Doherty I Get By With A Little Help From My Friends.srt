having a few other things for this talk

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,840
but things happen

8
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,640
uh so i've instead wrote a little script

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,880
for myself and uh we're going slideless

10

12
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,720
farmers accompanying me for when i

13
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,000

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,690
more support

15
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,359

a good few years

19
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,399
since i've known you

20
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,520
cool so i thought i'd uh i

21
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,600
popped this talk in uh first of all i'd

22
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,360
like to say welcome to everyone to my

23
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,840
talk uh this is i get both a little help

24
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,960
from my friends

25
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,520
or alternatively wow some paramaniac

26
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,960
from the north may to b sides and it's

27
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,320
freaking awesome

28
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,960
how the title works uh so

29
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,719
first thing a little bit about me i'm

30
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,280
ben dougherty i'm a team leader over at

31
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,719
uh team leader of engineering over at

32
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,080
gorham cyber

33
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,119
uh i'm quite an empathetic person and

34
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,880
what i mean by that is i bounce off the

35
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,400
energy in a room nothing makes me

36
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,840
happier than being in a room full of

37
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,799
energy

38
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,479
uh it's

39
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,520
my drug of choice really that that kick

40
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,759
of everyone working towards one goal and

41
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,720
that's what i love about cyber really uh

42
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,320
i did plan this talk a little

43
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,560
differently uh to how it's turned out i

44
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,040
had a full script set up i had obs

45
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,880
scenes and things going across the

46
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,360
bottom and all of that but

47
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,960
unfortunately some gates decided to

48
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,640
break into my shirt and make me laptop

49
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,640
with all that along with other stuff so

50
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,240
hey these things happen but plan b time

51
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,880
uh it's time to run over it this is the

52
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,399
version with 0.05 of the research uh a

53
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,240
lot more of the uh

54
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,960
energy and yeah skimming over a few of

55
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,479
the difficult bits that are just a

56
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,280
little bit too difficult to go into so

57
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,000
my talk i need uh i get by with a little

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,840
help from my friends what do i mean by

59
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,119
that well

60
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,799
i'm here to talk to you all about the

61
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,399
story of

62
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:07,680
an odd

63
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,840
fire-liking guy from the north that

64
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,319
somehow managed to make a conference uh

65
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,800
it's and it wouldn't have happened with

66
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,040
without well a lot of people sitting

67
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,160
that you can see on the other side of

68
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,120
the screen

69
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,959
uh it's uh it all starts with the chat

70
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,720
with the guy in the office next door to

71
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,440
me

72
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,520
this is many moons ago in a far

73
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,280
different company to what i work at uh

74
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,560
work out now

75
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,239
uh andrew waite uh he was a security guy

76
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,560
at where i'd worked at that time uh we

77
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,560
got chatting about security we got

78
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,080
chatting about the things that we know

79
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,239
and he mentioned b-sides london so i

80
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,280
thought right

81
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,879
i'll cool down i'll go down with him

82
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,080
i'll see if i can swing it from work

83
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,959
work managed to cover it uh and when i

84
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,879
got there it was just like

85
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:51,680
wow

86
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,319
i found my community i found my people i

87
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,400
was nowhere near the smartest guy in the

88
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,400
room i'm not normally but it's nice to

89

know that you're nowhere near the

90
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,680
smartest guy in the room and the energy

91
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,239
in the room of everyone that was there

92
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,879
for the same goal to see awesome talks

93

uh it's everyone being in there working

109
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,560
towards the same goal and went to the

110
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,560
same room and i as soon as i saw i

111
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,680
wanted to bring this home i want to

112

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,519

114
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,440
that hey we can do it we can make

115
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,280
something

116
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,080
but

117
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,280
that thought

118
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,560
it was in my head i didn't really know

119
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,799
many people it was there i was a lovely

120
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,720
security consultant i had a couple of

121
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,560
friends in the field but nothing much

122
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,920
but that's kind of where my journey

123
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,920
started uh it's been a couple years

124
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,840
after that and uh

125
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,840
after i'd started chatting with a few

126
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,680
people here at twitter and started

127
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,280
that's here on twitter and just started

128
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,959
kind of trying to make make myself a

129
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,079
little bit known uh i was

130
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,759
chatting at 44 con 2019 uh with jenny

131
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,759
radcliffe and chris morgan sitting

132
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,280
outside the ilec

133
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,639
i think it was

134
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,720
either just before or just after i

135
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,880
showed cyber sex stew how to spit how to

136
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,320
play with fire properly actually

137
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,000
spinning fires would be a glorious thing

138
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,199
to try and mix with infosec uh and

139
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,680
jenny was just chatting about how uh how

140
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,120
she'd set up and how she'd start to run

141
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,600
the b-side specs we started talking a

142
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,600
little bit more uh and by the end of the

143
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,280
conversation she gave me her contact

144
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,360
details and she was happy to mentor me

145
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,880
and guide me towards

146
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,880
helping with b-sides she'd give me the

147
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,400
information that i needed she told me

148
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,040
who to talk to she told me everything so

149
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,280
as all the b-sides organizers out there

150
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,680
know the crucial part of the process is

151
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,440
the jack chat

152
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,639
uh

153
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,360

168
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,720
those glorious things that i totally

169
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,880
ignored

170
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,680
uh

171
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,600
and he was particularly worried about

172
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,880
the time scale

173
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,440
uh at the time that was uh a little bit

174
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,120
after uh 44 con 2019 so that was

175
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,120
mid to late september and we were

176
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,600
planning on uh

177
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,440
having it in

178
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,880
oh

179
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,160
apparently gone uh september november uh

180
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,000
to plan on having b-sides in november i

181
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,680
think it was november 13th off the top

182
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,600
of my head or is that because i said

183
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,160
and it was about nine weeks by that time

184
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,520
he really didn't think we'd be able to

185
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,039
pull it off we'd be able to get the

186
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,319
people in and he warned me you know

187
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,840
don't don't tie yourself to it don't do

188
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,759
that so

189
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,360
now that we've got authorization it's

190
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,440
time for me to kind of go right we'll do

191
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,600
it and if anyone that knows me when i

192
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,600
say we'll do it it's happening it may be

193
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,280
a little bit late it may sometimes be a

194
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,319
little bit different to what was

195
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,800
originally designed but it's happening

196
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,400
uh and that's

197
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,840
when things started so what do you do

198
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,759
first you reach out you reach out on

199
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:36,880
twitter you reach out to the community

200
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,720
you ask people for help

201
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,560
uh and that's where

202
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,720
one of the people that

203
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,720
has kind of really really helped me all

204
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,600
along the process sam has had stepped in

205
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,039
and uh and phil had stepped in to kind

206
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,319
of help me run it uh sam she asked for a

207
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,240
sponsor form and then said oh is there

208
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,240
anything we can do to help

209
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,639
oh silly mistake

210
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,479
so she ended up roped in as one of the

211
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,840
organizers with me uh there was phil who

212
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,319
uh who runs quite a few of the north

213
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,560
east uh cyber fest north east a few

214
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,400
things like that chipped into right i'll

215
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,560
give you a hand organizing it so we had

216
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,440
our little team uh there was a lot more

217
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,440
people and as i've said there was a lot

218
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,800
more research version of this and there

219
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,160
should be a load of names going across

220
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,759
the bottom but it's not going to happen

221
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,919
i will give everyone credit anything in

222
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,199
the end but hey

223
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,880
uh

224
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,520
yeah so now we had some people who

225
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,199
wanted to run a thing next we need the

226
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,160
venue

227
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,560
so same again i'm this kind of person i

228
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,840
went to my friends

229
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,960
uh

230
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,400
i tried looking around for venues i

231
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,639
tried looking around for things and i

232
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,400
thought right let's let's think a little

233
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,120
bit off the uh off the reservation here

234
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,520
another off my plot yeah that's my plot

235
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,840
somewhere around that lines uh and i

236
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,520
reached out to one of my friends who'd

237
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,840
uh who ran a skate park in the area

238
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,879
so we had our venue we had a indoor

239
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,199
skatepark in the middle of november with

240
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,120
no heating but we'll get back to that

241
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,000
later

242
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,560
uh we had them offering to do it for

243
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,240
essentially the cost of covering what

244
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,080
they'd lose that day with being shut

245
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,479
which was awesome of them and better

246
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,160
still because they were friends they

247
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,080
didn't ask for a deposit

248
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,440
or other things like that but they

249
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,759
probably should have but hey

250
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,280
i was blagging everything at this point

251
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,280
we had very few sponsors involved we had

252
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,960
nothing kind of there

253
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,840
so yeah that's we had our venue we had

254
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,520
somewhere to put it currently was a

255
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,599
little bit odd but we had somewhere so

256
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,599
what did we need now

257
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,479
well we needed money

258
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,320
and that's the difficult bit finding the

259
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,200
sponsors but again that was made easy by

260
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,640
friends friends were reaching out to the

261
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,958
companies that they worked for uh people

262
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,080
were reaching out to other people that

263
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,279
they knew in recruiting other people

264
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,240
that they knew and that kind of thing

265
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,320
and they were working together to

266
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,160
really find and help me get this off the

267
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,920
ground uh quite a lot of friends

268
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,600
including some of the beer farmers

269
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,560
themselves

270
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,120
uh chipped in money off their own back

271
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,200
to get it running which really

272
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,800
made me want to do it so much better

273
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,959
because it wasn't just a semi-faceless

274
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,800
organization it was a friend that put

275
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,959
money in and really wanted to help make

276
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,720
something good so yeah it's

277
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,720
it's kind of i mean the sponsors that we

278
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,279
had in that first year there's x being

279

uh octopi research well yeah moon on a

282

283
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,399
recruitment all people giving their

284
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,080
hard-earned money the valuable time to

285
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,080
make it come true to make the dream of

286
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,240
this weird madman who thrown them up out

287
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,360
the blue and said here give me some

288

money i want to run something give me

289
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,319
some money worked

290
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,360
so

291
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,080
once we had a little bit of money sorted

292
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:38,880
out

293
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,040
i wasn't i was freaking out about uh

294
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,519
about being essentially really badly on

295
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,200
the hook for all of the money for the

296
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,320
conference

297
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,000
but i still was

298
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,440
things hadn't cleared stuff like that

299
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,360
but hey uh so

300

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,680
most important bit the speakers and

334
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,399
again we ran a cfp over i think there's

335
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,240
three or four weeks

336
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,839
ridiculously short time scale

337
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,200
ridiculously badly planned uh

338
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,000
google uh form to fill in for it oh it

339
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,720
was it was it was barely running barely

340
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,959
getting everything but it worked and we

341
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,279
got enough to enough people to fill up

342
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,880
the one track that we were planning and

343
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,959
then we got small people so we thought

344
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,959
we'll open up another track so we had to

345
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,160
work out where we're putting the other

346
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,240
track put the other track in

347
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,240
and it was uh

348
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,560
it was awesome i mean we had a load of

349
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,160
spat i did have the number in front of

350
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,839
me but it's not my list now but we had a

351
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,360
load of speakers there

352
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,880
uh we had a lot of people reaching out

353
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,399
on their personal accounts to get more

354
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,000
people involved in these more people

355
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,519
coming down to the b sides i mean at

356
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,360
that point i think b sides newcastle had

357
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,680
about 100 followers give or take uh on

358
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,320
twitter which is nothing uh but yeah

359
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,839
it's really

360
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,600
it was trying to uh

361
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,839
trying to get there uh we decided where

362
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,920
we're gonna put the second track

363
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,360
it ended up being quite close to the

364
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,440
wrestlers but again we'll come to that

365
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,639
one later on

366
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,560
uh and we started to feel that it was

367
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,800
going to work and work well

368
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,600
so on other finishing touches

369
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,360
many people who've organized conferences

370
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,120
will know what what's the most important

371
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,279
thing food

372
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,440
you get them fed they tend to be happy

373
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,959
you don't feed people they tend to get

374
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,560
grumpy halfway through especially if

375
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,240
you're doing something in a warehouse

376
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,160
with no food places around and nothing

377
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,120
in walking distance apart from

378
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,440
mcdonald's which

379
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,880
i'll leave that open as to whether that

380
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,760
counts as sustenance uh but yeah so so

381
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,920
what'd they do again more friends more

382
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,160
people came in i put a shout out

383
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,760
to a few people that i knew and said

384
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,920
look are we able to do anything is there

385
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,000
anyone got a food van that comes down

386
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,360
there's a limited kitchen but we can

387
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,279
maybe try and do that see what we can do

388
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,040
and uh it ended up uh some of my friends

389
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,040
who ran their own pizza truck a log five

390
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,519
pizza company come down and give us some

391
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,959
freaking awesome pizzas

392
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:49,920
funny

393
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,040
uh

394
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,839
but it dawned on me what would people do

395
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,920
while eating their pizza

396
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,440
of course they'd want something to do

397
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,680
they're not just gonna sit around so

398
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,959
run a wrestler

399
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,120
don't put a wrestling event on that's

400
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,680
gonna work i was uh i was walking

401
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,079
through with rico and rosa uh the owners

402
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,000
of uh dynamics the venue that we put it

403
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,240
at uh and there was a lot of grunting

404
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,320
coming from one of the corners

405
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,360
and

406
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,360
initially i thought this was a bit odd

407
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,040
lots of shouting slapping and grunting

408
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,639
but hey you know what happens in a

409
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,880
warehouse stays in a warehouse uh but on

410
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,800
a plate more investigation it was a

411
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,079
wrestling gym

412
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,959
so agreements were made pizza was traded

413
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,639
and all of a sudden we had a nice

414
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,760
wrestling show something odd we can't be

415
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,839
normal we put b sides in a

416
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,320
that's a freaking uh

417
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,240
skate park in the middle of november

418
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,240
it's it's gonna be cold uh yeah

419
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,399
so with with all the people involved it

420
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,720
was gonna absolutely kick ass

421
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,040
and then the problem started

422
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,000
uh

423
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,079
we didn't have projectors projector

424
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,639
rentals freaking expensive so me being

425
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,880
me yeah

426
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,680

427
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,639

428
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,560
uh shipping company

429
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,519
uh

430
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,680
we ordered some projectors 60 quid

431
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,680
projector what could go wrong

432
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,639
uh no speakers ah speakers with the mic

433
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,120
25 quid what could go wrong

434
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,120
uh recording again

435
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,600
i had a few laptops

436
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,399
now they're gone but hey uh so hey order

437
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,040

got some cheap cameras sorted

439
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,519
so

440
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,279
that point we've got everything we

441
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,120
thought right

442
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,320
everything's there let's throw the

443
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,600
tickets open

444
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,440
so we threw some tickets out there this

445
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,240
old

446
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,040
we threw a few more out there they sold

447
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,040

450
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,199
there's 250 people coming to this event

451
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,639
it's an event

452
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,920
uh time to panic

453
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,720
burnt panic we did as people who know me

454
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,639
know i do a very good headless chicken

455
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,399
impression uh but in the end it worked

456
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,040
everyone pulled together we had

457
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,160
speakers

458
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,720
filling the swag bags before the event

459
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,959
we had people printing stuff off at last

460
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,120
minute everyone who was involved in it

461
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,240
chipped in uh it was

462
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,320
it was it was good i mean we get on to

463
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,399
the the day of the event so near the

464
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,920
event pitch up it's knee tables

465
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,600
minor problem

466
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,680
sort it again managed to get in touch

467
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,920
with a local church borrowed some tables

468
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,399
off them happy enough got that done

469
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,480
so i got back and i got informed on the

470
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,000
other problem while i was there oh yeah

471
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,160
uh you forgot to set up your stages oh

472
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,639
okay okay so standard room only all

473
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,320
right everyone fixed that they went they

474
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,160
looked around they found benches they

475
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,720
found chairs they found stools they

476
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,320
found camping things they sat on the

477
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,279
side of half pipes and we made it work

478
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,040
it was the only conference that i'm

479
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,120
aware of where the attendees have built

480
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,759
the venue essentially

481
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,759
we had people running around hammering

482
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,519
nails into walls and all kinds so we

483
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,600
could get screens up and

484
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,600
it was insanity but it was

485
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,519
possibly my favorite event i've ever

486
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,759
been to and i mean i only caught three

487
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,600
talks out of it alive the rest i watched

488
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,079
catch up uh but yeah only caught well no

489
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,920
i didn't they never got recorded i only

490
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,680
caught a few few talks live on it but it

491
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,800
was awesome uh

492
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,440
oh yeah i forgot about the cold it was

493
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,880
freaking cold

494
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,560
we did warn everyone we said put a

495
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,240
hoodie on we said put a jumper on we

496
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,560
said it's maybe not the warmest of

497
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,440
events and we even got a heater rendered

498
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,160
a heater a little bit of a tip check

499
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,880
sizes of things

500
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,199

501
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,880
course you can't see that's about that

502
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,880
big

503
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,639
it's not the biggest of things

504
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,959
uh but we set it up at the village area

505
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,519
we got that going uh dr king has quickly

506
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,399
annexed it uh but hey

507
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,560
and it provided heat for maybe two or

508
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,399
three people okay

509
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,399
it worked it was part of the event it

510
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,240
was there it was part of the feel of the

511
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,519
event and

512
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,720

518
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,319
they went off it was the only bit that

519
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,400
went off without a hitch they managed to

520
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,640
find and steal the only airtight room or

521

with a few laptop fans spinning they

523
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,640
even managed to heat it which was pretty

524
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,160
good for them

525
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,799

event that i'd organized having that

540
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,440
feeling of

541
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,799
i helped do this

542
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,559
i pulled everyone together i i

543
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,400
seems a little bit me centric that

544
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,000
little bit but it's it's to to walk

545
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,280
around to get that feeling of

546
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,360
accomplishment that feeling of

547
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,360
this is awesome all of these people here

548
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,640
they've put their time in they're

549
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,720
talking to other people people having

550
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,720
conversations it just makes you so happy

551
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,080
on the inside

552
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,320
uh i mean

553
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,679
yeah uh

554
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,600
yeah so always running well they

555
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,760
proceeded the talks were awesome all was

556
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,799
good then i realized about lunchtime

557
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,039
cameras never got set up

558
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,799
a little bit of a scary one there so we

559
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,200
uh i bought it around trying to fix the

560
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,880
cameras trying to get things up

561
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,559
absolutely no hope the lighting was

562
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,039
ruined the camera shot was massive

563
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,320
nothing got recorded and that's my big

564
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,559
that's my big regret and that's that's

565
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,880
my only big regret about 2019 b-sides

566
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,200
that nothing got recorded but i kind of

567
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,679
get over it by saying it was

568
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,600
it was the woodstock of b-sides events

569
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,440
if you were there you were there

570
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,039
if you weren't you missed out and it was

571
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,280
 awesome

572
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,520
i'm sure come come many a moon's time

573
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,960
there'll be people pretending they were

574
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,760
there because it was there

575
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,080
but anyway while i was trying to uh

576
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,080
trying to fix the cameras we had a

577
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,080
wrestling show and that was freaking

578
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,360
awesome i caught some little bits from

579
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,400
over the top when i was sitting on the

580
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,240
top trying to sort some cameras out

581
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,640
uh still to know who won but plenty of

582
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,440
people look confused as hell uh why was

583
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,840
that there so job done on that one

584
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,000
uh the second part of the day rolled on

585
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,600
no more awesome talks

586
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,919
took us towards the end of the day uh we

587
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,480
had our other stage that had to share

588
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,160
their sound with the wrestling uh

589
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,160
practice so uh

590
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,919
there was a few odd grunts and things

591
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,760
like that coming over at inopportune

592
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,200
moments but hey

593
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,240
uh

594
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,760
and we got we really uh

595
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,640
yeah it really started to uh start to

596
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,160
look good and then as the light faded

597
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,159
another problem popped up

598
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,919
we had a minor issue

599
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,760
if we switch the lights on no one can

600
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,520
see the the uh

601
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,600
screens on either one

602
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,600
and there's only one circuit of light

603
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,440
for this whole warehouse

604
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,440
so what's the solution switch the lights

605
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,039
off

606
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,360
so towards the end of the day we shut

607
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,280
down a few of the other villages left

608
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,480
mental health building because it had

609
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,520
its own likes it was a little bit

610
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,720
indoors uh and thought sorry we'll just

611
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,799
do it with the lights off uh so that

612
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,480
that kind of gets to

613
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,960
get to my kind of major memory of the

614
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,760
event and uh it was kind of thanks to

615
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,000
one of the uh on the beer farmers who's

616
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,840
see it's still empty

617
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,120
get yourself running you should be here

618
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,240
by now

619
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,120
uh

620
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,520
and that was watching ian

621
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,480
give his origin talk essentially while i

622
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,480
was sitting on the edge of a half pipe

623
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,799
so well sorry sorry watching ian

624
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,360
silhouetted against the screen because

625
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,640
obviously you couldn't see him you could

626
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,799
just about see the projector

627
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,120
i was sitting on the edge of a half pipe

628
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,440
i was surrounded by friends and i really

629
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,320
felt at home that was

630
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,720
that was just the best feeling

631
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,760
and that

632
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,360
that's the feeling that makes me do

633
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,520
b-sides again and again and again and

634
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,760
it's going to keep me going it was it

635
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,520
was awesome

636
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,280
uh

637
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,200
all right so what where'd it go from

638
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,000
there we had 2019 the bag weird guy

639
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,520
community pulled together and we all

640
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,159
made it happen uh so we started planning

641
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,080
for 2020 thought right 2020 is going to

642
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,600
be our year it's going to be excellent

643
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,120
then the venue polls

644
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,159
because they're going to get read about

645
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,600
dinner housing thing and then we've got

646
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,679
another venue who also counsel on us

647
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,080
because a reservation without a deposit

648
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,080
gets trumped by a wedding

649
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,960
hey

650
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,440
uh and then kobe happened

651
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,559
which kind of everyone that's

652
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,120
sorry mocked everyone up uh you know

653
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,679
it's it's yeah so

654
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,840
to be honest i started panicking

655
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,320
i started locking down

656
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,559
i didn't know what to do i wasn't

657
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,320
reaching out for help i wasn't asking

658
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,080
and i wasn't doing what i should and

659
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,440
that's where happy hour kind of came

660
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,919
into the fruit came into the fray so on

661
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,480
happy hour i met people i met great

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,159
the list goes on and should really be

667
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,440
scrolling along the bottom but hey we

668
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,559

669
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:23,760

i was talking about the planning and it

673
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,720
was probably about a week before the

674
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,720
event was meant to happen and the

675
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,480
planning was in a disarray everything

676
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,840
was ruined

677
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,159
and i was in a bit of a state on happy

678
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,520
hour and

679
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,159

stepping in at what

685
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,200
i i've got down in my notes a week but

686
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,320
i'm pretty sure it was something like

687
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,799
three days

688
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,400
maybe two uh the that uh yeah we managed

689
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,760
to pull it together

690
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,120
we put on a great conference again we

691
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,760
managed to do two days we doubled the

692
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,559
size of it uh we did one and a half

693
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:13,919

track and we kept it open we we kept it

698
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,960
as much of the feeling of the b-sides

699
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,559
newcastle as we could

700
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,640

701
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,919
it was

702
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,320
yeah it was getting

703
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,280
sorry i've lost my space on my notes uh

704
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,960
yeah that a huge response everyone

705
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,960
chipped in and it was really a community

706
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,640
effort and that's when the community

707
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,720
started feeling really like a family

708
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,000
everyone was looking out for each other

709
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,320
everyone was helping out uh it was a

710
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,080
case of right what can we do to help

711
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,159

724
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,919
out there uh at the time the many hats

725
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:21,120
club really helped us out as well uh

726
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,400
yeah uh but yeah we were really

727
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,840
for the first time really kind of

728
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,360
starting to realize that hey this this

729
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,039
pandemic crack

730
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,640
still do things we can still run

731
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,400
comforters we would still be

732
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,799
bb side events at that year i believe we

733
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,760
were the only post covered

734
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,320
uk b-sides event to have ran that year

735
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,640
uh and i wasn't gonna not run it there

736
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,440
was no time in that where i genuinely

737
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,200
thought that's not gonna happen if it

738
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,880
would have been me sitting there ranting

739
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,520
at you all for for eight hours that's

740
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,159
what would have happened

741
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,360
but yeah it was it was awesome uh i mean

742
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,200
we had that's where we start to get some

743
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,279
of the little bit more order twitches in

744
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,799
so we decided how could we keep the

745
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,480
oddness well i know a few people at the

746
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,799
bartette association so hey two grown

747
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,279
men beating uh each other up

748
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,720
one kneeling down and pretending he's in

749
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,559
a hall and all of that yep yep yep

750
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,880
sounds exactly right so yeah we got them

751
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,039
into a talk at lunch uh i was chatting

752
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,279
with uh with one of my friends adam uh

753
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,799
and he had some contacts and managed to

754
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,320
get frank white to come over and talk to

755
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,799
us uh he did the lunchtime chat why

756
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,799
hacker should get involved with space he

757
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,559
went over the overview effect and all

758
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,720
kinds of awesome talks that really

759
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,000
i'd thought it existed but i didn't know

760
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,679
how to explain things and yeah he's

761
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,159
really is his talks were awesome we

762
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,240
managed to broadcast over twitch and

763
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,720
youtube and the only reason we managed

764
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,360
to get anything done was the crew that

765
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,279
all chipped in at essentially the last

766
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,000
minute everyone stood up everyone

767
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,840
put time out of their day put the effort

768
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,520
in and really worked together and that

769
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,440
that's where you get to it's the whole

770
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,320
community bringing things in and being

771
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,559
one big family and getting things done

772
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,960
it's uh i mean there was issues with the

773
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,039
stream there was issues with the

774
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,120
recordings i mean i stupidly record the

775
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,279
whole thing as one chunk don't do that

776
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,039
that that leaves you with a 14 gig video

777
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,279
file which doesn't edit well on like

778
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,320
eight gig i5s first jedi fives of that

779
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,600
uh and ten plus year old zeons no so

780
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,720
things like things like that the

781
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,559
recordings took a while to get up but

782
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,240
they were there it was an improvement

783
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,640
over last year and because everyone else

784
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,799
had reached out it was the real feeling

785
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,400
of everyone pushing towards the goal so

786
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,080
we actually managed to get all of it

787
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,679
kind of sorted out

788
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,320
uh it was awesome i mean

789
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,640
we had sponsors reaching out that we

790
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,919
were reaching out to them and like the

791
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,559
last days before the event and they'll

792
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,240
come back right we can't sponsor but

793
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,919
here's a prize we can't sponsor but

794
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,520
we'll help you with licensing we can

795
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,880
help you with this we can help you with

796
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,640
that and it really did feel like

797
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,320
everyone was just pulling together for

798
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,159
the for the main goal

799
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:55,039
so

800
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,480
where do we get to after that and i'm

801
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,760
skimming on because i know i'm chatting

802
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,679
a bit too much uh but we get to 2021

803
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,279
uh we are we were proudly the first live

804
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,919
b-sides event after call vid

805
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,760
it's it was

806
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,440
awesome we had

807
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,880
yeah we didn't have as many turn up as

808
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,799
we sold the tickets for yes a few people

809
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,480
dropped out judy covered which totally

810
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,760
understandable a few people dropped out

811
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,880
because they just didn't feel like they

812
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,360
could get there

813
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,520
but to help that we ran our platform on

814
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,360
gather james one of the guys that i've

815
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,080
met on happy hour uh i found this

816
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,919
platform was working with it and it's

817
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,679
awesome platform so we had that and the

818
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,600
interactions that we had on that we had

819
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,520
the feeling that it started bringing the

820
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,520
the b-sides flavor back to the online

821
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,159
ones uh we had all kinds of companies i

822
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,360
mean

823
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,279
the sponsors from last year colin over

824
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,440
at jumping uh sorry from this oh colin

825
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,880
over at jumping rivers without him we

826
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,399
wouldn't have had a venue

827
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,080
uh it was only because they'd got

828
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,080
involved that we managed to get as cheap

829
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,360
a price as we did on the venue we

830
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,640

the the beer farmers helping out with

848
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,039
every event i've done

849
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,960
uh and being there for the shoulder to

850
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,240
cry on in a lot of the situations as uh

851
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,840
as scott's rather wet shoulders would

852
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,399
tell you uh but yeah being there as a

853
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:45,120
friend and being there for it really

854
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,399
i mean

855
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:49,600
before i found myself my community in

856
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,000
cyber and my family in cyber

857
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,039
i was

858
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,640
that weird guy that liked playing with

859
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,039
things that that liked oh it

860
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,159
why are you plotting bits on your

861
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,200
network why are you doing that you meant

862
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,720
to be an itg you meant to play around

863
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,880
with computers i was that weird fire

864
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,000
spinning guy and with the family that i

865
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,559
found through infosec i'm not

866
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,480
i'm one of the one of the brothers when

867
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,880
i've got millions brothers in infosec

868
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,480
well thousands of brothers and sisters

869
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,640
in infosec and we all pull together for

870
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,200
the same goal it's all about

871
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,799
being better

872
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,720
getting better and growing with each

873
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,880
other and that's

874
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,799
i know it's been a bit of a choppy talk

875
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,279
but that that's pretty much it

876
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,440
i mean we're going to go on to 2022

877
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,279
we've got the same venue booked for that

878
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,440
double the space booked we've got so

879
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,840
many ideas in the planning

880
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,000
i mean speaking of ideas in the planning

881
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,600
all of the event things we were thinking

882
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,360
about the previous ones they're all

883
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,120
still there we're still thinking about

884
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,880
trying to do the highest hack i've still

885
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,760
got a iot catapult sitting in my garden

886
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,520
i've still got other things like that

887
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,279
that are going to be tied in i mean

888
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,279
duckless ships will be back it will be

889
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:58,000
rebuilt at some point but hey until it

890
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,360
gets to the point where we can all be

891
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,480
100

892
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,720
in a big area without masks without that

893
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,240
then it's just

894
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,000
i can't wait a bit but everything's

895
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,600
still there everything will be planned

896
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,240
and we'll get done but yeah i mean to to

897
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,840
wrap up i think one of the most

898
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,600
important things i need to say

899
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,679

900
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,919
