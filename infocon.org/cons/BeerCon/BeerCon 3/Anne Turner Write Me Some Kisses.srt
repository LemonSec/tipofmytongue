1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,040
hi everyone my name is anne turner and i

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,359
am going to uh give you my talk today

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,480
write me some kisses

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,280
yeah okay

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,920
so you started working in information

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,720
security due to an undying love for

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,800
writing reports and smashing your head

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,279
against the wall right

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,480
well

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,080
communication

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,920
is the thing that gives what we do

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,920
purpose it's the connection between the

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,760
work that we do and the things that we

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,000
know are important and the rest of the

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,880
world paying attention and listening to

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,120
what we have to say

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,719
um and like it i love it writing is a

18
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,600
large part of the job and it's the way

19
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,760
that we share knowledge and information

20
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,160
beyond the security bubble

21
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,520
so my talk today is about writing clear

22
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,559
plain language reports that have impact

23
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,199
and may save you some time and energy

24
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,120
too

25
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,800
so i thought i'd better give you a bit

26
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,000
of background about me um if you follow

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,600
me on twitter on either of my account so

28
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,240
my normal account at furry cake pixie or

29
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,960
my responsible adult account affinity

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,080
editing um you may know that i have a

31
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,920
massive cat who's affectionately known

32
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,439
as horsey cat

33
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,759
we also have a scaredy cat but he

34
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,280
believes that the camera steals your

35
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,720
soul so

36
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,520
um i haven't put him on the screen here

37
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,520
i also spend an inordinate amount of

38
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,360
time riding miles whilst going

39
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,479
absolutely nowhere in zwift

40
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,799
professionally i've been working in

41
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,439
information security for 13 years now

42
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,920
and most of that time within consultant

43
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,880
roles

44
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,320
and internal and externally facing ones

45
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,560
and specializing in security standards

46
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,240
and risk management

47
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,240
but in all the roles that i've had

48
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,759
during my career

49
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,119
report qa document qa and peer review

50
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,520
has always been a significant part

51
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,320
of my responsibility

52
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,680
because the thing is i'm a bit of an

53
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,399
interloper when it comes to security my

54
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,800
background is actually in language and

55
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,399
linguistics

56
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,560
i came into security

57
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,040
via training and communications

58
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,440
and when i'm asked i've always described

59
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,080
my place in security as being one of

60
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,440
translator

61
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,760
between the technical specialists and

62
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,840
their non-technical counterparts in the

63
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,360
business

64
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,040
and now

65
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,239
i've

66
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,920
retrained as an editor and proofreader

67
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,760
specializing in plain language editing

68
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,080
for information security cyber security

69
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,280
and technology writing

70
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,319
as security professionals we work in a

71
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,519
highly technical field and we have loads

72
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,519
of our own specialist language and

73
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,519
jargon that's not something that's

74
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,680
unique to security

75
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,319
by the way um it serves us well within

76
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,319
our own community it's a form of

77
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,879
identity a sign that we belong

78
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:03,760
but

79
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,319
and among our peers it can also be a

80
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,200
sign of authority and capability however

81
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,440
misguided that may be

82
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,680
unfortunately that's not the case when

83
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,920
we exit our own security bubble and it

84
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,680
can actually cause a surprising amount

85
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,239
of harm

86
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,360
so my talk today

87
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,840
i'm going to share with you some

88
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,599
examples of what not to do when we're

89
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,080
writing for other people

90
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,239
and also explain a little bit about why

91
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,159
we sometimes fall into these habits when

92
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,680
we write

93
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,760
i'm going to introduce you to the kiss

94
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,200
principles of writing and also explain

95
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,120
a little bit more background about why

96
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,720
it matters and the type of difference it

97
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,560
can make

98
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,799
i'm also throughout this talk going to

99
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,879
give you tips and techniques to help you

100
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,599
write more simply more clearly and maybe

101
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,840
more quickly too i will summarize these

102
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,280
towards the end and add a couple of

103
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,840
bonus ones in there

104
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,760
too and i'm going to finish by sharing

105
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,920
some additional resources that may be

106
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,200
useful to you

107
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,640
we are inadvertently trained to write in

108
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,640
language that makes things sound more

109
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,600
impressive than they are so take this

110
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
meaningless phrase that we have here as

111
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,720
an example

112
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,840
we need a more contemporary reimagining

113
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,000
of our homogenized transitional

114
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,800
contingencies

115
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,800
it's not hard to imagine something like

116
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,600
this being spouted in any meeting in any

117
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,479
organization anywhere we've all been

118
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,479
part of meetings that sound

119
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,040
very much like this

120
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,639
this kind of thing sounds familiar

121
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,040
because we hear it all over the place

122
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,680
this kind of hyperbolic and euphemistic

123
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,800
language that is ultimately meaningless

124
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,919
we hear it in business meetings and

125
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,719
boardrooms marketing and politics

126
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,479
it has no real content but it feels like

127
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,440
it expresses something we're just not

128
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,199
quite sure exactly what it is

129
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,120
now we emulate the language that we hear

130
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,000
around us so it's easy to end up

131
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,800
adopting this management speak phrasing

132
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,840
in our own writing it's what we hear and

133
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,960
so it becomes what we write

134
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,320
we are also taught most often through

135
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,639
standard education especially once we

136
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,000
get up

137
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,400
into university level education

138
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,320
to choose language that's far more

139
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,400
complex than we need in order to sound

140
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,720
more intelligent

141
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,560
now there is a place for this style of

142
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,360
writing but it has very little value

143
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,120
when we want to make sure that we can be

144
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,639
understood by as many people as possible

145
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,520
and even less so when we're suggesting

146
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,759
actions to deal with things like

147
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,759
critical vulnerabilities and security

148
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,080
failures or when we're trying to raise

149
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,520
awareness of good security practices

150
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,440
the language that we use doesn't even

151
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,759
have to be that complex to make it hard

152
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,360
to understand

153
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,960
and when we come across unfamiliar

154
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,000
terminology jargon or acronyms it slows

155
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,160
us down and it can quickly make a text

156
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,160
inaccessible

157
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,639
and that's without considering someone's

158
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,720
literacy level whether they're reading

159
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,360
in a second or third language or if they

160
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,800
have any reading or language

161
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,280
difficulties

162
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,680
now the example on the screen here a

163
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,080
handheld ground excavation tool was

164
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,240
deployed to penetrate the mantle super

165
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,240
substrate resulting in the formation of

166
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,720
a vertically descending shaft or in

167
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,240
other words

168
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,319
a spade was used to dig a hole

169
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,240
is problematic even when we do strip

170
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,800
away the ridiculous vocabulary because

171
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,639
it uses something called the passive

172
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:53,840
voice

173
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,080
now the passive voice highlights the

174
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,160
thing that was done rather than who or

175
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,160
what did the thing

176
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,800
and we see it a lot in reports and

177
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,759
formal writing

178
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,800
just as a quick aside

179
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,639
you can spot a passive sentence

180
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,319
relatively easily

181
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,880
so if you can add by zombies to the end

182
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,039
of your sentence then the chances are

183
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,199
it's in the past a voice so as an

184
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,319
example

185
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,240
a vulnerability in the firewall was

186
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,840
exploited

187
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,680
by zombies

188
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,440
in the active voice that would be

189
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,759
zombies exploited of vulnerability in

190
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,280
the firewall

191
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,039
now you'll find that zombies do a

192
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,520
surprising amount in formal reports so

193
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,039
if there's a chance to knock a few out

194
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,960
then do it your readers will thank you

195
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,360
now to be really clear

196
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,919
the passive can be useful in placing

197
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,680
distance between the situation being

198
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,080
described and how it happened

199
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,080
and who was responsible

200
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,319
or who was to blame

201
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,560
now in incident reports that might be

202
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,039
useful we may want to focus a lot more

203
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,039
on what actually happened rather than

204
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,960
who did it

205
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,400
but in test reports and audit reports

206
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,759
and assessments

207
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,000
you where you want people to grasp any

208
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,919
weaknesses that you were able to exploit

209
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,360
are a problem

210
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,240
it's often more helpful to show that you

211
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,759
did it it ground it in reality

212
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,199
so for example

213
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,199
weaknesses in the server configuration

214
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,960
were compromised and administrator

215
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,199
privileges were obtained

216
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,160
as a passive construction is a lot less

217
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,279
punchy and easy to skim past than

218
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,599
we exploited weaknesses in a server

219
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,919
configuration that allowed us to obtain

220
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,958
administrative privileges it's far more

221
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:41,839
real

222
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,200
when you did it

223
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,640
now the passive voice is also a problem

224
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,920
when we want other people to take action

225
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,800
passive is as passive does to bastardize

226
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,399
a phrase

227
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,040
it's not very good at compelling someone

228
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,279
to do something

229
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,600
so if you can state who should take an

230
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,640
action

231
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,000
then do

232
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,320
and even if you can't you can still

233
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,040
present a list of actions in in such a

234
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,200
way that doesn't need you to fall back

235
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,000
on the passive construction

236
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,800
so

237
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,120
just to give some examples here instead

238
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,519
of saying xyz systems need to be patched

239
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,279
you could say

240
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,399
the ops team need to apply patches to

241
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,279
xyz systems

242
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,440
or you could say something instead of

243
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,880
saying something like

244
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,959
multi-factor authentication should be

245
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,640
implemented for all users accessing

246
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,279
their network which is the passive

247
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,279
you could say

248
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,880
we should implement multi-factor

249
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,959
authentication for all users accessing

250
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,120
the network the royal we is just fine

251
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,320
you can even use something like an hour

252
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,480
recommendations r and then a set of

253
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,519
instructions to avoid falling into the

254
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,440
by zombies

255
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,040
approach

256
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,959
so you could say something like our

257
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,720
recommendations are

258
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,040
patch xyz systems

259
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,880
implement multi-factor authentication

260
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,040
for all users accessing the network

261
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,880
now another problem with the passive

262
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,200
voice is that it takes a lot more time

263
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,320
to absorb and interpret meaning than a

264
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,480
simpler more active and direct sentence

265
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,720
would

266
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,279
so taking away again the ridiculous

267
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,200
vocabulary here so we're left with a

268
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,680
spade was used to dig a hole

269
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,120
that is

270
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,279
takes us way longer to process than

271
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,320
saying

272
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,800
bob and anna dug a hole with a spade

273
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,959
they're diversifying a little bit

274
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,279
and the second is much faster for us to

275
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,920
understand and we also have a more

276
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,920
complete picture of the situation

277
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,160
because we know that it was bob or anna

278
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,760
that did the digging

279
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,000
we don't have to plug any information

280
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,160
gaps

281
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,160
now i don't want to tell you not to use

282
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,320
past sentences ever they do have their

283
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,399
place and so it isn't helpful for me to

284
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,680
say that

285
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,079
but what i will say is don't overuse

286
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,320
them and especially don't use them when

287
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,720
you're recommending or expecting someone

288
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,519
to take action

289
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,920
so i think when we're writing

290
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,320
for other people we need to assume at

291
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,360
least two things the first is that the

292
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,600
person reading what we've written has

293
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,519
absolutely zero time to spend doing so

294
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,680
and the second thing is that they don't

295
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,040
share the same vocabulary as you do

296
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,519
so they might know the same words that

297
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,920
you do but the definition that they have

298
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,760
for them may vary

299
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,959
slightly

300
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,680
or quite significantly from your own so

301
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,200
we shouldn't make any assumptions here

302
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,519
either

303
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,760
now my talk is called write me some

304
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,959
kisses

305
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,760
keep it simple stupid or keep it super

306
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,000
simple if you prefer and i make no

307
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,360
apology for using this acronym

308
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,440
it is a widely understood acronym that

309
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,200
was coined in the 1960s by a u.s navy

310
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,560
aircraft engineer called kelly johnson

311
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,760
and

312
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,880
he it was defined as a design principle

313
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,880
that meant that a jet aircraft could be

314
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,880
repaired by an average mechanic using

315
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,320
basic tools in the field

316
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,079
with no specialist equipment or

317
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,120
knowledge required to do so

318
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,639
now we can use this principle in our

319
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,040
writing by making sure that our language

320
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,600
is clear and that it doesn't need the

321
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,600
same specialist knowledge that we may

322
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,480
have

323
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,120
to write it in order to understand it as

324
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,680
a reader

325
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,160
now we do work in a technical field and

326
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,880
sometimes we will need to use specialist

327
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,439
language

328
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,720
that's fine where we need to use it but

329
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,200
if there is an everyday alternative word

330
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,680
instead then my suggestion would be to

331
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,560
use that

332
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,480
but we do sometimes need to use that

333
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,079
specialist language and that's where i

334
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,320
like this alternative version to keep it

335
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,279
simple stupid phrase make everything as

336
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,320
simple as possible but not simpler

337
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,399
now this is attributed to einstein but

338
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,160
whether or not he actually said it is

339
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,120
quite another matter

340
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,560
and i like this because

341
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,560
it suggests that when we do use

342
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,800
specialist language that's fine where we

343
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,560
need to use it we should

344
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,399
but we always need to provide a brief

345
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,040
explanation of it in everyday terms

346
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,880
sometimes using the correct terminology

347
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,320
is as important as making sure that

348
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,839
people understand what we're talking

349
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,760
about

350
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,880
now

351
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,040
when we try to explain our specialist

352
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,839
terminology using everyday language

353
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,800
we may need to make a payoff between

354
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,199
understanding so someone else's

355
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,760
understanding of our explanation and

356
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,160
total accuracy of the thing that we're

357
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,399
trying to define

358
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,240
so for example

359
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,480
a firewall can refer to a myriad of

360
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,480
technologies and solutions for i.t and

361
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,560
security professionals

362
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,120
but it's probably sufficient for most

363
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,240
non-techies to explain it as a safety

364
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,440
barrier to protect our internal systems

365
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,440
now that provides people with a simple

366
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,920
concept to refer back to

367
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,720
and it allows us to continue using the

368
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,959
accurate and correct term where there

369
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,880
isn't an alternative for the rest of our

370
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,480
document or report

371
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,279
so i wanted to just step back a minute

372
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,600
and share some data with you that shows

373
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,399
no matter who you're writing for

374
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,240
that more straightforward and plain

375
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,320
language really does kind of help

376
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,240
everyone

377
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,680
so on this screen

378
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,240
on the chart on the left of this screen

379
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,560
this is showing levels of literacy for

380
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,240
adults across australia the uk the us

381
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,000
and the oecd

382
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,839
countries um for

383
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,240
uh adult literacy and it's taken from

384
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,399
the 2013 and 2019 survey of adult

385
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,199
competencies run

386
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,440
and each colored bar

387
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,480
on this chart shows the percentage of

388
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,040
the adult population at a given literacy

389
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,560
level

390
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,880
now it may be quite small on the screens

391
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,279
in front of you but hopefully you can

392
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,000
see

393
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,320
that at the bottom of each column there

394
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,199
is a narrow gray bar now these are for

395
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,920
adults who have a literacy level

396
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,440
considered to be the low level one

397
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,920
now what that means is these adults

398
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,839
can't read a text

399
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,240
and they can't understand the structure

400
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,120
of a sentence or a paragraph when it's

401
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,880
given to them in a written form

402
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,519
at level 1 which is the yellowy orange

403
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,440
bar just above that

404
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,320
they may be able to identify a single

405
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,720
piece of information in a text

406
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,600
if

407
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,000
it's identical

408
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,800
to

409
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,120
information that they've been given in a

410
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,240
question

411
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,720
so if i asked someone with this level of

412
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,920
literacy something like what color is

413
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,519
jane's ball

414
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,279
and they had a sentence in front of them

415
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,560
that said jane's ball is red they may be

416
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,959
able to tell me that jane's ball is red

417
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,079
but if i

418
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,839
you know if i gave them a more lengthy

419
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,360
text and asked them a slightly more

420
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,360
ambiguous question

421
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,360
they would not be able to respond to

422
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,759
that

423
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,279
it isn't until above level three

424
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,519
which is the black

425
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,959
line and the

426
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,360
black color in the columns in front of

427
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,120
you and above that

428
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,000
slightly wider purple bar

429
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,800
on that chart it isn't until above that

430
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,880
level that adults are able to read and

431
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,839
navigate longer texts

432
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,839
and that is generally considered to be

433
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,319
the minimum level of literacy required

434
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,520
for coping with everyday life

435
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,959
okay

436
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,599
so for anyone below that line

437
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,839
things that we may well take for granted

438
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,319
such as navigating a bus timetable

439
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,280
reading a menu or following instructions

440
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,880
in a recipe

441
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,799
is off the table for those people

442
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,520
and what's staggering is that in the uk

443
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,880
that represents 49 and a half percent of

444
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,840
the adult population

445
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,840
we assume that everyone we're working

446
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,919
with has the same level of literacy that

447
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,000
we do

448
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,440
but that couldn't be further from the

449
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,640
truth

450
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,799
and the more clearly and simply that we

451
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,360
can communicate important information

452
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,919
the more accessible it becomes to more

453
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,640
of those people

454
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,679
now on the other hand the statement on

455
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,360
the right hand side of the slide is a

456
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,760
quote taken from a gov dot uk writing

457
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,919
guide considering writing well for

458
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,520
specialists

459
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,679
so research shows that higher literacy

460
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,320
people prefer plain english because it

461
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,760
allows them to understand the

462
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,440
information as quickly as possible

463
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,679
so these are people that we can assume

464
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,320
have higher levels of literacy and

465
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,559
generally will understand the specialist

466
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,679
terminology jargon and acronym specific

467
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,640
to their field

468
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,240
so i'm just going to quote a little bit

469
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,960
from the website here

470
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,240
so

471
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,720
they've conducted some research into the

472
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,480
use of specialist legal language

473
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,720
and in legal documents they found that

474
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,360
80 of people preferred sentences that

475
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,679
were written in clear english

476
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,919
and the more complex the issue the

477
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,960
greater that preference became

478
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,679
in addition to that over 90 percent of

479
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:56,400
people

480
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,679
preferred

481
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,120
plain english alternatives to latin

482
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,559
phrases even though in legal documents

483
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,039
latin phrases are really common to see

484
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,000
and they will be very familiar with them

485
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,320
now the more educated the person is and

486
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,559
the more specialist their knowledge the

487
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,880
greater their preference becomes for

488
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,640
plain english

489
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,960
so people may understand complex

490
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,559
specialist language but they don't want

491
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,919
to read it if there's an alternative

492
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,400
and often that's because these people

493
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,039
are incredibly short on time and the

494
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,360
reading demands required of them are

495
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,720
extremely high i think most of us will

496
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,360
be able to relate to that

497
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,440
so it helps when we can take in the

498
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,840
information that we need to

499
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,960
quickly

500
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,840
and plain and plain english

501
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,160
plain language and simple sentence

502
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,080
structures and constructions help to

503
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,080
make that much easier to do

504
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,640
so i said i'd give you some tips and

505
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,679
techniques

506
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,000
for how to do this in your writing now

507
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,600
i've talked about a number of these

508
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,840
already but i'm going to summarize those

509
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,760
again here and i'm also going to share a

510
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,280
couple of other

511
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,039
tips as well

512
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,919
so the first thing is be concise

513
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,919
say what you need to say without

514
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,520
embellishing it

515
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,880
and keep your sentences short

516
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,400
bear in mind that the shorter your

517
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,880
document overall the more likely it is

518
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,280
that someone will take the time to read

519
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,360
it

520
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,880
say who as well as what so this is about

521
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,520
avoiding the passive voice or

522
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,760
getting rid of a few zombies in our

523
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,679
documents

524
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,880
bob did x and anna needs to do y has so

525
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,080
much more impact than saying x happened

526
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,559
and y needs to be done

527
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,679
one drives action and the other probably

528
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,919
just gets ignored because no one has any

529
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,919
direct responsibility to do anything

530
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,039
use plain everyday language as much as

531
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,240
possible

532
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,880
avoid hyperbole and euphemism

533
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,919
so in summary say it as it is

534
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,159
minimize jargon and acronyms where you

535
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,320
can as well

536
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,880
straightforward everyday language helps

537
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,000
everyone

538
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,080
for those with no time

539
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,000
it's faster to read

540
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,840
for those reading in a second or third

541
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,480
language it's easier to interpret

542
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,799
and for those with reading difficulties

543
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,400
it's more accessible for them too

544
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,880
explain any specialist terms and we have

545
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,760
a lot of them in everyday language

546
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,159
even if that means compromising slightly

547
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,919
on the technical accuracy in your

548
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,240
description

549
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,039
and also this helps to get around people

550
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,640
who know the same

551
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,960
words that you do but hold a slightly

552
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,840
different definition for them as well

553
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,400
it gives people a

554
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,120
familiar and specific frame of reference

555
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,039
that makes the rest of your writing

556
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,840
easier to follow

557
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,200
now i would also say separate the

558
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,919
summary from the detail most people will

559
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,080
only skim the first few paragraphs of

560
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,320
anything that you write so provide them

561
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,880
with a summary to skin

562
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,280
focus on describing the problem and why

563
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,240
it matters and explain who needs to do

564
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,880
what to address it and if you need to

565
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,039
trim that back even further

566
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,880
describe the problem

567
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,799
and what needs to be done to fix it

568
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
now most cases you will still need to

569
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,480
include the details because

570
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,799
some people will still need to be able

571
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,840
to access that information so what you

572
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,159
did how you did it the full details of

573
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,159
any findings

574
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,080
but when we do this we should still

575
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,080
follow the case principles that i've

576
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,559
outlined here today

577
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,760
these people may be more specialists

578
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,480
and they may well have a greater vested

579
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,320
interest and a deeper understanding of

580
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,240
what you have to say

581
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,320
but these people are still short on time

582
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,280
to take everything in so help them to

583
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,760
help you stick to the point and only

584
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,440
share what they need to know

585
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,919
and i just want to close

586
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:18,880
the main

587
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,080
body of my talk with this quote here um

588
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,159
writers of plain english let their

589
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,880
audience concentrate on the message

590
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,640
instead of being distracted by

591
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,200
complicated language

592
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,520
they make sure that their audience

593
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,640
understands the message easily

594
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,919
and that

595
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,919
is what we should all be trying to do

596
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,559
so

597
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,960
in this talk today i've barely touched

598
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,640
on all there is to say about writing

599
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,960
with kisses and using plain language for

600
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,480
everyday writing

601
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,799
i've just focused on some of the basics

602
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,600
so preferring everyday vocabulary and

603
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,000
shorter direct sentences

604
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,080
offering summary information to help to

605
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,080
get your message across even if someone

606
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,640
doesn't read your whole document

607
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,880
avoiding meaningless gobbledygook and

608
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,960
complex sentence structures that can be

609
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,919
ambiguous and hard to interpret

610
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,520
if we do these things it makes our

611
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,240
writing more accessible to more people

612
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,559
it makes it faster to read and easier to

613
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,760
understand

614
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,559
and

615
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,440
as a bonus for us it can save us time

616
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,440
writing it as well

617
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,880
now there is so much more that's

618
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,279
relevant to plain language writing and

619
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,600
effective writing and from the way that

620
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,520
we write and the words we use to the

621
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,600
structure the format the layout choices

622
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,960
that we make

623
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,559
and the decisions that we make around

624
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,679
conscious and inclusive language as well

625
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,360
these are all talks for another day and

626
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,120
i hope to be able to cover more of them

627
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,760
in the future

628
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,400
if you want to ask about anything i've

629
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,640
talked about here today please get in

630
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,559
touch um my details are on the slide

631
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,559
the slides i will make those available

632
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,320
as well as a transcript of the full um

633
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,960
talk as well

634
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,200
i have also included a couple of links

635
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,640
here to

636
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,559
two plain english plain language

637
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:13,760
campaigns

638
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,960
there's some great resources out there

639
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,039
to help with this subject

640
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,279
so the first one is the plain english

641
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,679
campaign in the uk which focuses

642
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,159
obviously on british english and i've

643
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,640
also included plain language.gov in the

644
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,960
us for american english

645
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,080
there are differences it does matter so

646
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,240
if your organization

647
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,080
uses american english i would point you

648
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,159
to the plain language.gov site and if

649
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,159
it's british english than the plain

650
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,440
english campaign in the uk

651
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,799
now

652
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:47,679
all

653
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,480
uh that remains for me to say is

654
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,159
thank you for your time

655
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,159
and a massive thanks to the beer farmers

656
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,120
for organising and hosting vidcon

657
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,720
as well as all the behind the scenes

658
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,520
support for the speakers too and that's

659
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,640
been awesome

660
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,799
thank you and thank you thank you very

661
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,679
much i've got a i have an observation to

662
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,960
make or just a thing to share really and

663
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,760
and it reflects on how incredibly valid

664
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,159
everything that you've said is

665
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:16,960
so

666
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,200
in the information security community

667
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,600
there are trendy jobs or jobs that are

668
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,000
perceived to be quite trendy and we have

669
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,080
this conversation in the car

670
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,000
on the way down from scotland via

671
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,720
manchester yesterday morning afternoon

672
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,200
and evening

673
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,159
and

674
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,760
and the the notion was proposed that

675
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,200
people want to be in pen testing

676
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,080
penetration testing because there is

677
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,840
perhaps a perception

678
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,919
that it's super cool and you're doing

679
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,159
hacky hacky and all that kind of stuff

680
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:49,840
and yeah of course to a certain extent

681
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,600
that is true

682
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,880
but to a larger extent a significantly

683
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,240
large extent

684
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,640
it's about writing stuff down and

685
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,360
delivering it to people with probably

686
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,360
less of an understanding of the material

687
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,200
the content of that material than than

688
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,120
you have as the as the person that

689
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,960
produce it

690
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,080
and when pen testers find that out

691
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,760
they suddenly realize that the job isn't

692
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,600
quite as cool as they thought it was in

693
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,840
the first place

694
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,600
and and dave

695
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,120
our crew member

696
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,320
hey dave

697
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,120
um

698
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,640
speaker and

699
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,279
currently nerf gun wielder and a hacker

700
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,640
and a hacker

701
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,799
uh he made a point which was really

702
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,000
interesting that

703
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,360
a lot of people are now going no i want

704
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,840
to get into incident response

705
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,760
because that seems cool you know fending

706
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,559
off the bad people bad guys or whatever

707
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,399
but what they don't realize

708
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,720
is that's five percent doing cool stuff

709
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,600
and 95 writing reports

710
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,039
but at 3am

711
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,120
because it's incident response

712
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:51,919
so

713
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:53,840
that's all i wanted to say in it but it

714
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,600
the point i was getting at really is

715
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,679
you've got to communicate to people and

716
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,360
more often than not they know less about

717
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,880
the subject matter than you do and

718
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,440
that's why everything you've said is 100

719
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,799
right

720
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,520
i i want to just jump into this because

721
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,679
there is no better investment that you

722
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,039
can make in infosec or in your career

723
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,279
than learning how to write and how to

724
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,520
write effectively for people to read

725
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,240
your stuff and and i think that's really

726
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,039
important and i i will be the first to

727
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,320
admit that i was not a strong writer i

728
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,960
was i was not like at a quality at a

729
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,919
journalism level quality and you know he

730
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,679
even struggled putting together criminal

731
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,360
analysis reports when i was with the

732
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,799
rcmp

733
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,679
um but i made that investment to learn

734
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,159
both business writing and intelligence

735
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,799
analyst writing and you know haven't

736
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,760
looked back it's a huge career

737
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,399
accelerator and if you actually expect

738
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:53,120
people to do what you need them to do

739
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,960
then you absolutely have to write

740
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,880
clearly because then you'll have a

741
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,640
chance the other thing i want to point

742
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,039
out which was amazing that claire

743
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,279
dropped that statistic that it was just

744
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,679
so that i got that right it was 47

745
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,000
percent of uk

746
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,679
what was what was the stuff

747
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,600
49 and a half

748
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,840
said that

749
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,559
49.5

750
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,559
that's unbelievable and when you think

751
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,399
that you're trying to get across you

752
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:21,840
know technical

753
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,120
uh cyber security things and the

754
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,440
equipment the people that you're trying

755
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,080
to get that message across aren't going

756
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,440
to be at that literary literacy level

757
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,600
it just you know it's startling no

758
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,799
wonder things are as bad as they are so

759
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,799
i have a question

760
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,240
um

761
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,480
my question is i'm new to the industry

762
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,320
and i'm starting off and i want to build

763
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,840
up my skills

764
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,080
what would be your recommendations anne

765
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,240
for someone new trying to build up their

766
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,760
skills especially their writing skills

767
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,360
and trying to get

768
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,080
that sort of knowledge of not only the

769
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,640
writing skills but how to present that

770
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,600
to

771
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,879
say senior management

772
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,760
developing skills in writing i think

773
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,480
partly it's doing it you have to do it

774
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,960
but the thing i would say is really make

775
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,279
sure you know your subject

776
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:18,399
we think that we need to use we use

777
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,000
clever words to make ourselves sound

778
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,440
clever right

779
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,360
actually the most clever people in the

780
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,200
room are the ones that can explain the

781
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,440
most complex thing in the most

782
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,880
straightforward way possible so make

783
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,360
sure that you understand what you're

784
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,960
talking about before you talk about it

785
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,600
it's kind of like less is more tap

786
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,760
a sort of thing yeah and don't

787
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,320
underestimate the amount of effort that

788
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,760
goes into that

789
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,159
as well

790
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,559
i love that by zombies reference though

791
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,799
i'm gonna start responding to well we we

792
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,240
don't check it we don't ever read each

793
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,640
other's emails anyway but

794
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,159
i'm gonna now start going through them

795
00:30:58,159 --> 00:30:59,840
and go well actually you know you should

796
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,279
have changed this to something more

797
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,519
assertive because it's too passive

798
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,760
yeah absolutely yeah no that was really

799
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,760
good yeah absolutely amazing talk

800
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,080
there's a lot of great feedback um on

801
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,880
the twitch um chat so yeah thank you

802
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,600
yeah wonderful thanks thank you and um

803
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,960
and it's it's been brilliant because

804
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,720
it's been a

805
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,039
it's it's added to the variety of topics

806
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,039
i think that we've covered yeah it's not

807
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,600
good it's not all about the tech

808
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,399
and the perceived cool stuff there are a

809
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:29,919
lot of other things that people need to

810
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:33,600
know about and a lot of it is scaling up

811
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,440
um obviously people will have challenges

812
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,720
that will make it more

813
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,159
more difficult for them to do this kind

814
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,159
of stuff and we appreciate that

815
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,159
but um yeah it's been fantastic so

816
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,000
thanks ever so much yeah brilliant

817
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,840
thanks again everyone cheers
