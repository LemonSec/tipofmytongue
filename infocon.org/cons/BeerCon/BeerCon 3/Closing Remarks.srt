and they're the people that have made it

61
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,360
easier and in some cases very easy for

62
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,280
the people to

63
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,360

70
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,959
behind the scenes but

71
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,560
more often than not freely available for

72
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,400
our speakers to get in touch with

73
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,840
share their presentations get some

74
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,920
coaching get some support and the

75
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,760
speakers supported each other as well

76
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,840
which was super cool and typically like

77
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,480
we did last year the bay farms kept out

78
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,000
of the whole mentoring scheme so it was

79
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,319
not to interfere with it really

80
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,800
because we're not mental

81
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,760
right

82
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,640

90
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,640

yeah because we did it for you

125
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,120
we did it to enlighten people stretch

126
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,960
people's imagination and i think you'll

127
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,800
agree that there was a really why i

128
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,040
mentioned it earlier really wide variety

129
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,800
of talk topics that we've covered over

130
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,160
the two days

131
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,639
some very technical some not technical

132
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,560
some about people because it's all about

133
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,360
people yeah that's what we do you know

134
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,639
we talk about people processing

135
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,280
technology in technology as an industry

136
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,720
but it's nothing without the people

137
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,320
people build things

138
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,240
people operate processes but in

139
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,960
businesses people take orders

140
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,880
they do billing the provision systems

141
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,960
that's what it's all about people and

142
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,400
communities been mentioned a lot of

143
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,320
concepts across the two days

144
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,720
and that's really really important daily

145
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,160
and deeply important to the bear farmers

146
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,919
and the people that work with us

147
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,520
and that's why they're here because

148
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,720
we've all

149
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,400
dedicated our time and effort and the

150
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,840
speakers have dedicated their time and

151
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,080
effort and the crew

152
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,680
but the people that have listened in and

153
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,919
watched in over the two days of the con

154
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,400
conference no comic con so this concert

155
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,479
yeah it's a festival yeah it's a

156
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,600
festival um i've made it what it is

157
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,400
so

158
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,960
a lot of engineering and a lot of effort

159
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,400
we took a risk doing this we could we

160
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,840
could have all just sat home and did it

161
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,880
via zoom

162
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,360
and used heavenly biscuit our magic

163
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,000
computer to make it all work for us but

164
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,440
we haven't seen each other in a long

165
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,280
time long time very long two years

166
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,360
probably we've never met scott

167
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,720
hi um it's a big bear farmer by proxy in

168
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,000
many ways

169
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,199
but

170
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,960
we give a [ __ ] and that's why we put

171
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,160
this stuff together and the people that

172
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,479
work with us care as much as we do and

173
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,919
the people that come and talk at our

174
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,560
conventions they care as much as we do

175
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,800
so that's kind of a wrap

176
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,759
um have i forgotten anything

177
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,080
the road is yeah

178
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,880
yeah okay you missed your point now yeah

179
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,720
jared so not only has jared been our

180
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,960
engineering rock

181
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,880
but he's also been the guy and that this

182
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,400
feels really pathetic but he's been the

183
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,160
guy that's brought his teeth

184
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,560
and and bears and and broke some egg

185
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,960
cups and he shattered some egg cups that

186
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,280
hexa beam donated that apparently don't

187
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,039
like pachin

188
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,759
as the evidence

189
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,960
i think the moral of that story is don't

190
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,638
pour drain cleaner into an egg cup

191
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,720
all right we're going to sign off now in

192
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,960

215
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,240
tuning in from their respective

216
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,039
countries and homes so we thank you we

217
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,199
hope you enjoyed it the next steps in

218
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,520
terms of the materials we will we had we

219
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,120
know we had some

220
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,560
seems like a distant memory now but we

221
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,919
did have some

222
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,319
issues yesterday morning um

223
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,879
but we will review

224
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,000
an edit the recordings if we think we

225
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,759
might need to maybe redo them and we're

226
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,039
willing to do that because we will

227
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,719
always promise that you get an artifact

228
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,640
a speaker gets a thing at the end of

229
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,159
this as well as the kudos and feeling

230
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:36,958
good

231
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,120
about the event they get something that

232
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,120
they can say i did that that was my

233
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,599
thing so if we do need to reach out and

234
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,920
maybe do a podcast equivalent of your

235
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,000
talk slot then that's exactly what we'll

236
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,080
do and we'll do it soon so you'll get a

237
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,000
recording for all the material that

238
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,760
we're able to publish that'll go out as

239
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,440
soon as we get it done and last time we

240
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,560
did it within two days no guarantees but

241
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,000
we'll get it to you as quickly as we can

242
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,200
and that's it

243
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,040
and that's it so we hope you've had a

244
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,120
good time and continue to have a good

245
