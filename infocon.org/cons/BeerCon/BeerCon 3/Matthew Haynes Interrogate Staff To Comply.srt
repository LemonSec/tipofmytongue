1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:02,240
so it gives us very

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,640
great pleasure to welcome matt haynes uh

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,319
somebody that we've known for quite a

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:08,000
few years now

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,320
um we've met a lot on the conference

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,400
circuit around the uk

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,920
great guy um and he's gonna talk to us

8
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,400
about well it seems a curious title

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,600
to this talk

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,119
but it's around

11
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,560
bringing your

12
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,400
your people along with you i think is

13
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,720
possibly the best way to describe it

14
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,359
so we'll uh we'll give you the format if

15
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,279
you want to share any slides you've got

16
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,160
absolutely yeah no problem and um

17
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,079
we will

18
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,760
shut the hell up

19
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,239
and allow you to proceed so

20
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,000
which is a rare occurrence i'll take the

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,360
opportunity while i can get it

22
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,960
absolutely

23
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,800
we are running a few minutes late but

24
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,800
don't let that worry you you just run

25
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,399
the course of the time that you've got

26
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,559
your 30 minutes excellent and uh yeah

27
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,480
thank you very much

28
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,039
any of you to interject and i always do

29
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,680
like a bit of a bit of banter for sure

30
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,280
but hopefully the slides are displayed

31
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,159
now and you guys can see them okay

32
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:04,959
yeah

33
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,600
wonderful stuff okay absolutely so for

34
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,119
those who don't really know who i am my

35
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,200
name is matthew haynes um i do try to

36
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,000
get involved in the community as much

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,080
it's never enough um

38
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,000
and a couple years ago i gave a few

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,920
talks around intelligence

40
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,040
and that is a lot of my background

41
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,000
so

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,880
i

43
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,080
thought you know what we could try and

44
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,960
bring

45
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,920
that

46
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,880
into into this talk today um so it's all

47
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,240
about interrogating your staff

48
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,920
so on the start percent that your users

49
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,640
your staff are your weakest link

50
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,759
they're the ones that are clicking on

51
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,840
the links and they're the ones that are

52
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,680
causing organizations to become

53
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,320
compromised

54
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,119
a mindset like that antiquated and will

55
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,680
only lose to failure of your security

56
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,079
program

57
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,200
with those sort of concepts and those

58
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,719
sort of approaches i want you to have a

59
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,880
think about what intent integration

60
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,280
integration to interrogate what

61
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,400
interrogating actually means to you what

62
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,520
sort of

63
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,680
actions and thoughts come to mind what

64
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,520
images do you sort of see when you see

65
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,239
it

66
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,400
and maybe you see things like this is

67
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,480
typically how we sort of see uh

68
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,920
interrogation

69
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,800
the spotlight put on you uh the use of

70
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,040
fear uh and and damage and and an injury

71
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,840
is brought to us to actually

72
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,560
to

73
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,560
uh release information

74
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,840
effectively that's what we want or to

75
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,120
comply

76
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,519
to actually use these attributes these

77
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,560
sort of skills uh tools in the toolbox

78
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,080
to actually get someone to do what you

79
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,920
want them to do

80
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,920
so let's have a quick look at a

81
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,120
description

82
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,599
so oxford is saying interrogation

83
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,760
is act of asking somebody a lot of

84
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,480
questions over a long period of time

85
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,119
especially in an aggressive way

86
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,080
but i'd like to actually think well

87
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,760
what yes okay that does come to mind

88
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,519
with those images but is there another

89
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,360
way and i want to try and show you

90
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,360
another way

91
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,560
i have here

92
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,560
our completely opposite

93
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,680
images that we saw but these are in fact

94
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,840
uh interrogation techniques

95
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,480
we've got here warmth comfort support

96
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,799
caring even seduction

97
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,159
and what we're trying to do here is

98
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,680
we're trying to get the same outcome

99
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,560
we're trying to help those people abide

100
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,599
or apply

101
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,798
buy this information

102
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,360
let's look at another description

103
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,440
so miriam webster actually saying that

104
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,000
interrogation is the sending of an a

105
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,959
electronic signal intended to trigger a

106
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,560
particular response

107
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,159
for those who know very technical on the

108
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,000
line you probably think that maybe

109
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,680
that's not really a human fac

110
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,000
due to related uh response but it

111
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,920
ultimately is the interrogation

112
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,239
and we are kind of doing that today and

113
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,080
when we do that with our with our

114
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,000
training security awareness training

115
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,080
programs we are

116
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,680
sending out training

117
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,000
and then we're quizzing them on it we're

118
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,760
asking them questions and expect them to

119
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,599
provide us with answers we're

120
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,879
effectively

121
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,920
interrogating them

122
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,959
so

123
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,880
if we look a bit further into sort of

124
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,040
the way that we have in a very

125
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,560
simplistic manner

126
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,440
how we're actually trying to compa uh

127
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,600
deal with it in phishing and threats

128
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,199
that are coming from that

129
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,080
and look at some statistics and what the

130
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,320
training perspective

131
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,479
these are all sort of um

132
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:39,680
a little bit of fun with the camera now

133
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,960
it's going a bit blurry let me just sort

134
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,840
that out very quickly

135
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,440
there we go so

136
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,199
on average email's coming through all

137
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,440
the bad that hits the perimeter

138
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,360
20 of that bypasses your security

139
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,680
gateway on average

140
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,479
anything in our staff mailboxes

141
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,120
so today typically your staff are about

142
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,600
thirty percent susceptibility so one out

143
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,120
of every so three out of every ten of

144
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,639
your staff would like to click an

145
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,039
average phishing email we're not talking

146
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,600
about highly um sophisticated or

147
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,199
spearfishing we're talking generic

148
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,520
standard stuff

149
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,520
if your staff on average you're getting

150
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,240
down to about 13 susceptibility

151
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,840
and depending on the quality of the

152
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,759
training and other factors whether the

153
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,080
engagement of your staff depends on how

154
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,919
low you can get to 13

155
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,639
and beyond

156
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,320
now our staff

157
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,440
aren't

158
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,120
where they were 10 years ago they've

159
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,720
evolved

160
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,880
10 years ago we would say absolutely our

161
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,560
staff are our weakest link you know even

162
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,520
though you could probably argue back

163
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,720
then that wasn't the most appropriate

164
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,039
thing to say it was a lot more true back

165
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,840
than it is today

166
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,759
a week doesn't really go by but we don't

167
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,919
talk about a breach or an attack or a

168
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,680
compromise

169
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,840
a major news outlet

170
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,680
our staff are a lot more switched onto

171
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,240
this term of cyber security and fishing

172
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,360
so therefore we need to be thinking

173
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,840
about how we can further evolve that

174
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,440
now unfortunately fishing it becomes

175
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,560
more sophisticated

176
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,120
and also by volume so the problem is

177
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,039
getting worse but our staff are getting

178
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,840
better so we've got a bit of a

179
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,199
nuance here that we need to sort of

180
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,000
compensate for

181
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,960
so

182
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,560
the government many of you are probably

183
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,720
aware of this as abused a number of

184
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,400
years ago by our government so by the uk

185
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,840
government so the uk government

186
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,600
recognizes that cyber security is a very

187
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,800
big problem

188
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,840
i think they recently reported about 27

189
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,120
billion cyber crime in the uk alone

190
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,120
and they want to try to compensate for

191
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,280
that by creating new jobs bringing

192
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,199
skilled workers into that profession to

193
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,759
help reduce that impact that is cyber

194
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,440
crime

195
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,759
but the problem is this highlights so

196
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:50,880
i'll just say this highlights our

197
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,479
particular problem with the fact that

198
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,919
although i

199
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,840
cyber security is awesome i get very

200
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,360
excited by it and i'm sure the majority

201
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,520
of people in the call do as well we

202
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,960
recognize how important it is we rely on

203
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,599
people that don't think the same way

204
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,039
we're relying on people that actually

205
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,039
think security is quite mundane and

206
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,560
quite boring

207
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,680
and certainly not something they're

208
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,520
interested in but yet

209
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,840
we tell them to not click a link and

210
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,680
compromise the business

211
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,070
so this particular

212
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,240
[Music]

213
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,319
poster got a lot of backlash and

214
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,560
rightfully so because it's perfectly

215
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,800
acceptable to be a profession of the

216
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,840
arts

217
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,759
or to be a profession of something else

218
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,599
because cyber security really isn't that

219
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,960
big really isn't that important

220
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:36,800
so what we need to try to do is have

221
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,720
that understanding that while we do

222
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,720
think this is important we actually need

223
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,440
to engage people who may they may not

224
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,080
think the same way

225
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,199
and it all kind of goes back typically

226
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,720
our security program around questions

227
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,560
and nonsense we've trained our staff in

228
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,599
some occasions and that training

229
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,960
down the throats of of our of our users

230
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,400
and by doing so what we're doing is

231
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,240
we're creating a barrier we're actually

232
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,199
becoming

233
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,960
become more disgruntled so we're

234
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,960
creating further barriers and separating

235
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,479
them in us

236
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,080
and this idea of questioning and

237
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,919
answering we've trained our staff and

238
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,319
now we're going to quiz them

239
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,840
whether they understood the material

240
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,680
we've just taught them and we need to

241
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,440
know this really from a

242
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,360
reassurance perspective

243
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,120
have they adopted that training is the

244
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,560
training correct is it actually

245
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,400
training our staff to become compliant

246
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,000
or actually ultimately so we actually

247
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,559
become safer

248
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,919
but one of

249
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,519
with this is that

250
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,599
is this really truly a good

251
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,440
representation of actually an attack

252
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,519
this is knowledge but we need more of a

253
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,839
practical way of dealing with that

254
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,480
so a way that we can actually deal

255
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,160
with this uh this training is through

256
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,240
fist simulation and i'll go into that in

257
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,680
just a moment but one thing i want to

258
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,760
say as well about the security

259
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,680
training and question and answering

260
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,519
is we do it periodically

261
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,200
and why do we do it periodically because

262
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,040
of skill fade and skill fade is

263
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,959
something we need to be aware of as well

264
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,720
so when we train someone or just tell

265
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,399
someone about something it becomes the

266
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,640
forefront of that mind

267
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,880
so when you come to a decision process

268
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,680
so

269
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,480
link

270
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,600
or selecting what you're going to have

271
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,760
for dinner whatever the topic

272
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,040
whatever's a foot in the forefront of

273
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,320
the mind is going to help and influence

274
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,920
that decision process

275
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,920
so that's why we get skill fading and

276
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,000
that's why we need to actually emphasize

277
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,560
almost on a micro level that security is

278
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,320
important and it's something they need

279
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,680
to be this

280
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,839
of in that decision process during

281
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,680
clicking links going to websites or

282
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,760
whatever it may be

283
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,600
so in this realistic scenario we

284
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,640
actually want to sort of do fish

285
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,959
simulation well how do we do that well

286
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,880
what we do is we put on our hoodies we

287
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,040
sort of come one with the hacker and we

288
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,760
sort of start to simulate a criminal

289
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,800
see in an ethical way and we're sort of

290
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,880
sending our staff

291
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,560
uh phishing emails to actually

292
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,000
understand yes they've got the knowledge

293
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,160
and yes they understand the material but

294
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,120
what do they actually do in that

295
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,640
real-life situation

296
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,519
and i just want to be really really

297
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,800
conscious that not everyone's a dog

298
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,120
lover so people with cats can actually

299
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,399
do the same thing

300
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,560
and you know they can be involved uh

301
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,680
with

302
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,760
with this fishing simulation

303
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,720
but

304
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,120
while it is a proven metric and can be

305
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,880
done in in a in a very positive manner

306
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,680
there's a certain way to do it

307
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,480
and

308
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,240
the other question around how do we do

309
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,720
it but how far should we go with this

310
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,920
mimicking of a criminal

311
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,480
the two major organizations have come

312
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,720
out and um there's actually many other

313
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,480
scenarios these two really do stand out

314
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,880
quite prominently they fished

315
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,480
their staff not a unknown tactic

316
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,240
but the way they went around it and

317
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,399
probably even the timing of it

318
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,560
probably wasn't the best way

319
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,680
they would be

320
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,839
their staff you're going to get a bonus

321
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,519
or you're going to actually get

322
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,000
a holiday bonus or workers bonus as part

323
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,760
of their program

324
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,560
now this is a particularly emotionally

325
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,640
driven and sore point for many

326
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,079
especially the last couple of years for

327
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,000
certain industries where money has been

328
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,760
a huge issue for some

329
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,440
or even having work

330
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,040
really sort of jump on those heart

331
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,079
strings

332
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,440
you have to question is that even

333
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,760
ethical and the ncrc actually massively

334
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,360
discourage this type of behavior

335
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,480
and two things that come to mind

336
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,160
straight away around this is that what a

337
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,000
great way to cause your staff to become

338
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,560
disgruntled and become an insider threat

339
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,160
they're already inside your organization

340
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,920
um nobody got the opportunity they may

341
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,200
or may not have the capability but

342
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,959
you've just given them a sort of reason

343
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,079
um to do it an intent

344
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,040
and the other thing as well is you're

345
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,480
just creating barriers in between

346
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,480
security and staff again and it's the

347
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,920
last thing that we want to do we don't

348
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,839
want to separate these two well security

349
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,120
is very good about putting layers of

350
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,240
security in it's one of those areas

351
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,000
we actually want to bring those staff as

352
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,440
part of the cohesive manner

353
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,160
and because we actually want to

354
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,760
understand our staff we need to be

355
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,760
really reliant on metrics there are lots

356
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,600
of solutions out there that actually can

357
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,000
help understand those behavior metrics

358
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,120
but you actually want to go a little bit

359
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,160
beyond whether they're getting it

360
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,480
correct or incorrect you actually want

361
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,480
to understand the engagement factor you

362
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,720
also understand you know who is getting

363
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,040
what type of material correct and also

364
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,959
be mindful of that when they're in a

365
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,480
certain profession

366
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,720
they may be more susceptible so if

367
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,160
they're in recruitment they're going to

368
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,920
be receiving a lot more

369
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,600
documents

370
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,880
if you work in another sector for

371
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,480
example they're getting in a document

372
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,560
might be quite unique thing so for them

373
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,160
they might instantly trigger into this

374
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,800
is abnormal

375
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,360
so the way that we sort of deal with

376
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,880
this i want to break it down in into

377
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,680
sort of two major areas uh what about

378
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,600
caring and all about skills now the

379
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,839
skills is kind of an area we spend

380
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,320
in this sort of security awareness

381
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,839
space but carrying on what i want to

382
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,639
talk a little bit more around today

383
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:01,519
and

384
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,200
when we do this we want to actually try

385
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,920
to create a number zero to ten so as

386
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,600
security professionals i'm sure that we

387
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,760
are all number ten i'm sure we all care

388
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,519
about security and we all have the

389
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,519
skills to actually do something

390
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,680
about it but we need to be realistic in

391
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,920
our goals and our aspirations with our

392
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,160
staff perhaps our staff are not even a

393
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,240
five perhaps there are three

394
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,639
but that might be okay based on the

395
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:25,519
threat

396
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,920
our first point of cure is to not be the

397
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,600
lowest hanging fruit

398
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,839
so being a two might be okay our

399
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:34,560
aspirations show them not to attend as

400
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,040
high as possible but within a realistic

401
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,480
and in a pragmatic manner

402
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,560
so care is broken into two elements

403
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,399
it's being a significance what we call

404
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,959
and the relation piece okay

405
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,399
so the the the significant factor is the

406
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,760
scale

407
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,519
is this particular threat

408
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,320
actually a big deal you know the so what

409
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,720
factor we get compromised we get

410
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,800
ransomware that's fine we're backed up

411
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,720
we've got a backup to restore please the

412
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,120
threat isn't as big or maybe we don't

413
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,199
have very good backups and actually the

414
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:08,399
bigger issue

415
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,320
being significant and communicating that

416
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,639
connected course um could be quite you

417
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:13,680
know

418
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,600
understanding what the ramifications of

419
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,279
a particular attack is

420
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,920
and then the relatability is is sort of

421
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,440
while being aware of something is big

422
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,720
you know i know

423
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,440
that nuclear bombs are a big problem

424
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,279
but where's the relationship to me is it

425
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,600
going to happen to me hopefully wood

426
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,839
unlikely but there's a sort of different

427
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,440
factor there

428
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,680
a really good way of doing it so so musk

429
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,680
um shipping containers were massively

430
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,760
impacted by not petty uh if you're not

431
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,760
aware of this it's a really interesting

432
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,360
use case and i'd highly recommend to go

433
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,959
and look into it

434
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,399
but we couldn't even use this as use

435
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,880
case now a shipping container or sorry

436
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,519
should i say a a shipping um

437
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,000
organization as a

438
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,839
in this simulation has nothing to do

439
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,760
with us so why would the threat that

440
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,399
they went through impacted us well they

441
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,440
actually got impacted or the the vector

442
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,880
was um

443
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,079
ukrainian

444
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,120
software

445
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,959
used for tax purposes

446
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,880
well we use that in this simulation so

447
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,800
therefore that therefore i care about

448
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,760
that

449
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,920
and i just realized that that particular

450
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,920
software is set inside my network and no

451
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,839
longer on the boundary and we therefore

452
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,079
because inside safe

453
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,519
we have less controls we're not

454
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,199
monitoring it so now i can actually

455
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,320
understand the relationship and the

456
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,800
significance of that particular scenario

457
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,600
and then skills i

458
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,959
don't miss about this too much because

459
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,199
it's spoken about quite a lot and

460
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,800
there's a lot of material online that

461
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,000
can really go into this but it's

462
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,560
basically how to spot fishing

463
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,959
and this is an ever increasing list and

464
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,959
it gets kind of complex so the main

465
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,399
point of here with the identification

466
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,600
piece is

467
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,920
try not to make it too complicated

468
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,320
very very difficult i appreciate but

469
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,320
we're dealing with people that who may

470
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,920
even struggle turn the computer on and

471
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,600
off when you start to explain to them

472
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,279
about the differences between puny code

473
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,160
and and and other links and and foreign

474
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,399
characters they they may not understand

475
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,639
it and they may also have much interest

476
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,120
in it have not willing to invest that

477
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,759
time to learn

478
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,519
told our staff that something is really

479
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,040
important and is really important to

480
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,680
them and how to spot it we need to tell

481
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,519
them what to do and this is very

482
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,920
organizational specific it might be

483
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,759
click the button report you might before

484
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,600
that email on it might be just to tell

485
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,240
someone call up delete the email

486
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,839
tell management whatever it is in your

487
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,240
process

488
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,000
just make sure you disseminate them to

489
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,800
your to your guys

490
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,800
so just sort of a couple of last little

491
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,320
points and then we're sort of wrapping

492
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,000
up so don't forget we're down with a

493
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,600
human being here not dealing with the

494
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,240
computer and dealing with emotions and

495
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,759
we can impact those emotions through

496
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,440
many different attributes

497
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,920
like we can when we interrogate someone

498
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,040
so we actually want to try and get

499
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,240
someone to be happy and and be enjoyment

500
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,640
and that's that's ours the optimum space

501
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,160
where people are engaged and willing to

502
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,720
learn new things and be most productive

503
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,079
if we're in other elements whether

504
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,959
they're in an anger or a fear state such

505
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,160
as if you click that link you're sacked

506
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,240
as opposed to if you actually spot

507
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,959
fishing will reward you you have to also

508
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,160
question which one of those two is going

509
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,799
to be more um effective it's not just on

510
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,000
a short but in a long time

511
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,440
gamification is something i want to

512
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,840
mention as well it's a feature as a

513
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,840
functionality it's basically the art of

514
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,000
creating a game-like situation

515
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,720
um to elicit um

516
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,919
engagement

517
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,280
and gamification is fantastic and

518
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,360
there's lots of ways of doing that

519
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,520
so i would highly recommend that if you

520
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,080
try to look at using gamification as

521
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,520
part of your security program

522
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,280
so it's actually ultimately up to you on

523
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,720
how you want to interrogate your staff

524
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,720
to comply you might actually want to do

525
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,160
a open hand approach and be

526
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,919
willing to engage in a very supportive

527
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,440
manner or perhaps you actually want to

528
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,280
use a fear approach it depends on you

529
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,960
and your organization

530
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,720
but just be mindful that if you do use a

531
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,360
fair approach that your staff actually

532
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,600
may leave you with something

533
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,440
behind

534
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,799
so i hope that was really helpful and i

535
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,640
hope that sort of made you think about

536
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,160
uh how to actually deal with your

537
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,520
security awareness programs in your

538
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,520
organization um as a tournament as a

539
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,320
human being um i just want to mention

540
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,360
that we're doing some research with

541
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,280
bristol university so if you want to be

542
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,120
involved in trying to help understand

543
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,520
humans within the office space

544
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,880
please sign up

545
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,960
um and i will literally

546
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,880
wrap up there so thank you very much for

547
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,640
your time i hope that was helpful

548
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,080
it certainly was matt and i tell you

549
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,440
what the the overwhelming feedback in

550
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,799
the twitch chat

551
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,160
is around

552
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,799
do the right thing by your people not to

553
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,919
your people

554
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:54,880
and

555
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,440
very much the sentiment is that

556
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,280
this is a journey you've got to take

557
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,480
people on

558
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,320
not push people down or push people

559
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,640
sideways or out the door or any of that

560
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,039
stuff because as i as a senior manager

561
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,880
in my organization responsible for

562
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,760
security and we've spoken recently as

563
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,440
you will remember

564
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,520
for us it's all about

565
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,600
making people feel good about getting on

566
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,000
the journey yep making them understand

567
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,840
that it's our responsibility to equip

568
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,440
them with the right knowledge skills and

569
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,799
understanding to make the right

570
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:27,919
decisions

571
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,080
it's not then there are those people

572
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,000
that are ultimately accountable for a

573
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,760
control failure it's the people that

574
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,919
apply the control and often that's your

575
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,880
grc and your infosec cybersec people

576
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,880
so if you get an opportunity to read the

577
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,080
twitch

578
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,400
the the open hand approach that you

579
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,799
described is the most the more popular

580
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,880
and it seems to me the more effective

581
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,200
one rather than the pistol

582
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,080
but it was a fantastic talk really good

583
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,840
um from somebody who clearly knows what

584
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,320
they're talking about so

585
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,320
thanks ever so much we really appreciate
