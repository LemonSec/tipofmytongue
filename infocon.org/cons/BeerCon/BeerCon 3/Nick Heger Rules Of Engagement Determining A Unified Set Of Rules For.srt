i

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,240
this is a controversial topic and i

8
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,840
think this is going to be really really

9
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,079
interesting there's please join us on

10
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,640

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,039
hold on to your seats this is going to

12
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,519
get wild so over to you nick

of thanks everybody this is my first

15
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,960
time ever giving a talk at

16
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,400
a conference and i am

17
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,479
so excited and also you know tiny bit

18
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,360
nervous but like mostly real excited

19
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,120
um so hi everybody

20
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,280
i'm nick i'm a telecom administrator at

21
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,280
the university of manitoba here in sunny

22
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,360
winnipeg even though it's it's not sunny

23
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,200
at all right now

24
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,000
um

25
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,360
we're going to talk today a little bit

26
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,000
about fishing pretexts in simulated

27
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,920
engagements uh specifically in the

28
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,079
context of cobid

29
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,680
uh the coronavirus pandemic it's

30
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,000
obviously given us a lot of things for

31
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,359
you know people to be stressed and

32
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,559
nervous about

33
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,840
and we're seeing that exploited pretty

34
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,438
pretty significantly in the wild by

35
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,119
malicious actors

36
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,400
so we're going to try and address

37
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,479
what this means in the context of

38
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,320
simulated attacks and see if we can't

39
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,400
come up with the set of rules that will

40
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,000
enable us to

41
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,640
use this or or not as the case may be if

42
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,280
it seems more responsible

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,920
all right so real

44
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,759
quick outline here uh just so that we

45
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,360
all know what we're getting into uh

46
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,640
there's gonna be some interesting facts

47
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,640
about where i'm from and where i work uh

48
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,320
we're gonna talk about what elements

49
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,640
contribute to a good pretext

50
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,079
we're also going to talk real briefly

51
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,399
about why we even bother with

52
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,560
fishing simulations and then we're going

53
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,079
to talk about some suggestions about

54
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,479
integrating covad

55
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,360
into your fishing simulations or or not

56
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,920
um also i've got a lot of memes in my

57
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,920
presentation i'm hoping that if it's not

58
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,360
super informative for you at least it

59
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,159
can be entertaining

60
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,280
all right so fun winnipeg facts i'm

61
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,880
going to assume that most people aren't

62
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,759
from canada here in the audience

63
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,360
this is a picture that i took last

64
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,000
winter and it was

65
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,480
as cold as it looks uh so the two things

66
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,400
that every canadian knows about winnipeg

67
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,720
are that it's real cold in winter and

68
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,239
whenever it's not freezing cold there

69
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,800
are a ton of mosquitoes

70
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,800
there's also an interesting thing it's

71
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,480
been

72
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,400
it's been inhabited for the last about 6

73
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,400
000 years because it's a major meeting

74
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,720
place of two rivers and was super vital

75
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,879
during canoe trade

76
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,800
and today it's the eighth largest city

77
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,959
in canada and it's a hub for aerospace

78
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,440
technology and a ton of agribusiness

79
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,560
so i work at the university of manitoba

80
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,400
is it really a university if it doesn't

81
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,239
have some kind of castle-like structure

82
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,120
i don't think it counts

83
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,680
um i'm a telecom administrator i oversee

84
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,920
about 10 000 cisco and avaya voip end

85
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,000
points as well as about a thousand cell

86
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,400
phones

87
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,680
i noticed over the last few years that

88
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,480
we

89
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,840
very consistently get what i would term

90
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,920
or think of as low effort phishing

91
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,599
simulation emails from our information

92
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,800
security folks uh they reflect a lot of

93
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,760
what they see and walk in

94
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,840
in real life but it got me really

95
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,400
wondering about who falls for these kind

96
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,319
of things and

97
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,519
basically what we can do for him

98
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,760
working at a university one of the

99
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,560
most interesting fringe benefits is that

100
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,400
you get free access to almost all the

101
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,080
academic journals in the world and any

102
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,920
book you can imagine

103
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,680
so the more i got reading into this

104
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,879
because i was curious the more

105
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,440
interesting it became

106
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,280
it gets me real phishing research gets

107
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,239
me really excited because i've i've got

108
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,920
a communications degree and the idea of

109
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,239
the psychology of influencing people how

110
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,439
to

111
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,200
do something that isn't necessarily in

112
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,959
their best interest it's it's

113
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,720
fascinating to me

114
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,519
um i'm real bad at diving into things on

115
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,599
the deep end so just for a real quick

116
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,760
second we're going to take um a couple

117
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,840
of moments here and just do

118
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,840
some definitions

119
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,320
phishing is when a molasses actor

120
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,238
uses a crafted message to get a victim

121
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,839
to take an action that would otherwise

122
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,720
be considered undesirable or insecure

123
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,880
traditionally we talk about fishing in

124
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,840
terms of account or credential

125
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,520
compromise but with the rise of um

126
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,919
come on brain uh with the rise of

127
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,840
ransomware and um

128
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,680
like gift card scams and

129
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,520
wire transfer scams

130
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,040
i like to expand that definition a

131
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,440
little bit to just include any action

132
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,199
that is otherwise undesirable or

133
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,040
insecure

134
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,560
as an aside i don't know if it's the

135
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,040
same everywhere but here anywhere that

136
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,680
sells gift cards now has signs the size

137
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,479
of my head that say the government isn't

138
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,160
going to ask you to pay your taxes with

139
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,360
a gift card

140
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,560
the police aren't going to ask you to

141
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,479
pay a fine with a gift card

142
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,080
and if you have questions to talk to the

143
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,639
people at customer service so it's it's

144
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,840
obviously a huge issue

145
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,680
and

146
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,680
it's lots of people are falling for it

147
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,280
to the tunes of thousands of dollars a

148
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,520
day

149
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:20,880
so

150
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,479
why do we even bother with fishing

151
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,000
simulations

152
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,400
pretty much however it goes somebody's

153
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,400
going to fail either your red team is

154
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,560
going to when your users don't fall for

155
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,160
it or the users are going to fail when

156
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,479
they do

157
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,320
the objectives that you have going into

158
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,639
this are going to do a lot tell a lot

159
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,400
about the maturity of your information

160
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,160
security program

161
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,479
uh your vendor for example they probably

162
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,080
want as many people as possible to take

163
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,360
the baits that they can sell your

164
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,639
follow-up training

165
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,759
uh your information security

166
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,360
probably wants something in the middle

167
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,160
so they can get a decent

168
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,840
feel for the risk and exposure of their

169
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,039
business

170
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,199
and then the higher ups your your cio

171
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,360
and your cso probably want as few people

172
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,800
as possible to fall for it so they can

173
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,720
go to their bosses and say hey look what

174
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,680
we're doing it's working

175
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,560
the other thing that we do

176
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,000
at the university is we feed the fishing

177
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,120
simulation to awareness pipeline

178
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,360
in my sort of platonic ideal fishing

179
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,440
simulation pipeline uh the first time a

180
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,400
user clicks on a uh on a message they

181
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,639
get a captain america detention video

182
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,080
that says hey

183
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,240
you clicked on a phishing email

184
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,560
you screwed up it's okay happens to

185
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,479
everybody these are the things you

186
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,840
should look out for

187
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,919
real short video just sort of brings it

188
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,680
back to the front of their mind

189
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,840
uh second failure they should be sent to

190
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,120
an actual online course through your lms

191
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,800
bit more information about recognizing

192
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,560
liza's messages and sort of building

193
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,639
resistance to them uh with a third

194
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,199
failure i would have the half day

195
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,199
probably in person and in class thing

196
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,360
with your information security team

197
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,919
just so that we can figure out you know

198
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,919
what it is that's going on and then

199
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,360
fourth time onwards it's time for

200
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,479
one-on-one attention

201
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,479
they probably are like something's

202
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,000
obviously wrong if they keep falling for

203
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,080
the same tricks over and over again um

204
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,919
are they doing it as a joke is it

205
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,560
malicious are they just so overworked

206
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,000
that they don't have time to pause and

207
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,319
analyze their messages uh because i mean

208
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,800
repeated insecure behavior it's it's a

209
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,120
huge liability and we should probably be

210
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,360
figuring out the actual root causes for

211
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,520
it

212
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,160
so jumping right in what makes a real

213
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,400
good fishing pretext

214
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,199
um should be timely and rel relevant to

215
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,319
current events um surprisingly this is

216
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,120
one of those things that is maybe the

217
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,520
most controversial um studies are

218
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,199
showing that it only contributes to

219
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,919
about a four percent conversion rate

220
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,639
but um at the same time every year to

221
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,759
tax time

222
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,039
we see an enormous spike of hey this is

223
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,319
the government you need to pay your

224
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,520
taxes or else you're going to be in

225
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,680
trouble so it's obviously working for

226
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,680
the malicious actors even if it doesn't

227
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,520
necessarily bear out in the research

228
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,479
your phishing project should require

229
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,400
some kind of urgent action

230
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,000
uh there's sort of two ways to go about

231
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,520
this there's the rewards based or the

232
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,800
loss based

233
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,280
uh the reward based is if you don't

234
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,000
click this you're going to miss out

235
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,479
uh the fear of missing out or fomo

236
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,400
uh the law space is if you don't click

237
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,520
this you're gonna lose access to

238
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,960
something important

239
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,120
and um this is really interesting and

240
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,799
it's important because if you can

241
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,159
stimulate

242
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,799
someone's fear response it leads to a 15

243
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,559
decrease in self-efficacy

244
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,000
which is the likelihood that the target

245
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,839
will take your correct action

246
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,920
um we see this

247
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,440
in the real world as it were because

248
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,480
malicious actors will claim that

249
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,240
if you don't take this action and do

250
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,519
this thing that we want you to you're

251
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,320
going to go to jail

252
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,560
they should come from a trusted source

253
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,560
or at least they should appear to

254
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,360
um this elon musk fake

255
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,279
bitcoin ethereum scam is one of my

256
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,360
favorite things in the world

257
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,920
it is wildly successful

258
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,920
they've taken people for about 2 million

259
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,480
us dollars that we know of it's about

260
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,120
1.4 million pounds

261
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,720
and people just send the money and hope

262
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,640
that it comes back doubled

263
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,240
um so what they're doing is they're

264
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,120
combining in need for immediate action

265
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,160
uh the promotional only lasts 24 hours

266
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,240
and the fear of missing out

267
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,120
um

268
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,440
which i mean it gets otherwise tech

269
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,519
savvy people with fairly good judgment i

270
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,480
mean who else invested in like bitcoin

271
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,680
to uh

272
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,000
to take actions that otherwise they

273
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,880
would just laugh at somebody else for

274
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,200
in a phishing simulation we can

275
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,839
sort of trigger this

276
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,480
trusted source or not by making sure

277
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,240
that our emails come either from an

278
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,640
internal address or from an external

279
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,839
address

280
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,360
and hope that people will actually

281
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,440
notice that

282
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,600
pretext should include a trusted design

283
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,040
element

284
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,200
did you know you can right click on any

285
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,959
of these logos and just add them to

286
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,439
everything

287
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,519
take yourself in the chat if you're here

288
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,760
with us on twitch i am shopsite high

289
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,000
security

290
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,600
uh so trusted design elements they don't

291
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,079
need to include logo uh having something

292
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,000
as simple as like a copyright notice at

293
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,320
the bottom of your email or this message

294
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,519
is for the use of the independent

295
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,000
recipient only uh it adds credibility to

296
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,680
a message that would otherwise have

297
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,360
people strongly doubting

298
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,959
uh having the correct design elements it

299
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,279
increases trust and conversion rate

300
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,640
between 17 and 25

301
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,000
which is just incredible like that

302
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,920
that is the biggest single jump that

303
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,120
you're going to see

304
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,680
uh the versailles logo on a website

305
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,760
has the biggest impact because people

306
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,000
recognize it from websites that they

307
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,399
like stuff like amazon or with

308
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,760
wikipedia

309
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,600
but um nobody really understands how

310
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,800
these things work and when they're

311
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,640
interviewed they just say oh yeah i've

312
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,880
seen that before and they don't know how

313
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,440
it secures the website or what it

314
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,839
actually means

315
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:10,959
uh the other one that i found really

316
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,959
entertaining is inclusion of a twitter

317
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,560
or a facebook link

318
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,440
increases trustworthiness by 19 in one

319
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,279
study because participants when they're

320
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,720
interviewed about it are going to say if

321
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,720
it was a scam the victims would post

322
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,680
reviews and warn others

323
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,720
so with all of these design elements

324
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,160
that we're talking about how do we still

325
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,000
have this problem if we compare these

326
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,800
two messages the one on the left is an

327
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,160
honest-to-goodness message that a

328
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,920
national telecom is sending out during

329
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,160
cyber security awareness month to get

330
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,079
people to download

331
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,640
a maybe slightly sketchy looking free

332
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,839
mobile security app

333
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,519
on

334
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,279
the right we have a

335
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,600
genuine phishing message that we got

336
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,560
which we're going to look at a little

337
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,160
bit more detail they should be well

338
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,320
constructed a few or no spelling or

339
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,560
grammar errors uniform font throughout

340
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,000
if it looks like a random note it's

341
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,560
going to get treated like a ransom note

342
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,279
um and like this one especially is it's

343
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,279
one of my favorites that i've ever seen

344
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,519
and it's it's incredible because there's

345
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,600
outages every single day a lot of them

346
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,519
are real short so your individual users

347
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:20,880
might not notice

348
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,120
uh the the potential win of the free

349
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,000
gift is it's a reasonable dollar amount

350
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,279
nobody's saying you're gonna win a

351
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,440
million dollars for this outage

352
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,160
and everything about it is designed to

353
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,399
get you to click the slightly sketchy

354
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,680
survey link right below it

355
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,720
so

356
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,480
with all that in mind

357
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,519
is cro

358
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,040
coronavirus the ultimate free text

359
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,040
um it it's hugely impactful to our

360
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,480
day-to-day life it has caused massive

361
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,399
disruptions things are changing all the

362
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,800
time so there is urgent action required

363
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,959
um you can put

364
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,519
basically anything about your government

365
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,320
or your company or your universities or

366
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,200
the cdc because nobody's quite sure

367
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,760
what can constitute a trusted source and

368
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,000
it generates a

369
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,760
huge emotional response we've all i'm

370
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,200
sure seen videos of people losing their

371
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,079
marbles on servers or retail staff who

372
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,600
are just saying hey could you just pull

373
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,200
your mask up over your nose please

374
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,480
so

375
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,800
let's talk about rules

376
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,279
is a blanket ban on code related pretext

377
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,680
practicable and is it desirable i think

378
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,680
we can all agree um malicious actors are

379
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,440
definitely using coven as a pretext for

380
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,680
crime um

381
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,920
that being said

382
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,440
my opinion is that we should take a high

383
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,800
road we still have to work with these

384
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,839
people once we're once we're done our

385
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,839
simulation uh we consistently see about

386
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,040
a 10 increase in click rate uh more or

387
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,320
less regardless of the pre-tax and it's

388
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,240
debatable if we fool more people uh

389
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,680
we'll get them into that first step of

390
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,160
the pipeline but at the same time there

391
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,519
is a chance to breed some real

392
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,519
resentment about it

393
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,839
uh by contro i figured by combining

394
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,000
training consistent mess

395
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,680
messaging and leveraging our technical

396
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,519
tools available um so stuff like flag

397
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,920
emails as suspected spam or as external

398
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,000
to your organization and making

399
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,440
reporting easier

400
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,519
i'm a big believer in a spam at

401
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,120
organization.com

402
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,880
email address

403
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,320
we can decrease the incidence of people

404
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,760
feeling like they need to click these

405
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,639
emails to find out what they're about

406
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,040
on a related note the front face of our

407
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,560
information security program at the

408
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,720
university is like the calmest

409
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,920
friendliest dude in the world

410
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,279
and i think

411
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,360
that having people who are good at

412
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,959
making you feel

413
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,120
not stupid for asking questions and not

414
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,760
intimidated is really important in terms

415
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,040
of getting

416
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,040
desirable behavior out of your out of

417
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,440
your users and i think that it

418
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,120
goes a long way to

419
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,880
finding out problems early versus when

420
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,000
you have to

421
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,839
institute your disaster recovery plan

422
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,320
because you've gotten ransomware

423
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,120
um

424
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,120
if you are going to use it i have a

425
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,720
couple of suggestions uh excel sheets

426
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,199
with macros in them are

427
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,920
super tempting as a delivery method

428
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,240
but if you have it pretending to be a

429
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,320
list of employees who have not declared

430
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,160
that they intend to get back

431
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,320
vaccinated a lot of people are going to

432
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,760
click on it

433
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,040
a lot of people are going to have bad

434
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,199
feelings about it afterwards um one

435
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,399
thing we're doing at the university

436
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,519
right now is we've got a link to a

437
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,839
portal to self-declare your vaccination

438
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,759
status and it'd be a real good thing to

439
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:40,720
fake

440
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,240
um

441
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,600
have it fail the first time when they

442
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,680
punched in a username and password and

443
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,160
then go to the correct one so that they

444
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,759
can actually log in

445
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,279
most people just assume they typed it

446
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,560
wrong

447
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,040
and they will go through

448
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,800
and not even think twice about punching

449
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,560
their username and password in and you

450
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,759
will get a ton of credentials that way

451
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,480
so i think i'm about out of time

452
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,880
uh real quick if there's any questions

453
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,480
or comments i'm going to hang out in the

454
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,759
discord

455
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,639
i am at nick hager on twitter and on and

456
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,480
underscore hager on instagram you can

wow that was just awesome and uh shout

460
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,440
out to my fellow winnipegger what's up

461
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,240
hey

462
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,120
i was uh i was making fun of uh every of

463
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,040
your accent to all the rest of the beer

464
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,440
farmers oh i have an accent don't you

465
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,120
know oh no

466
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,360
just just a tiny one don't you know oh

467
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,600
no um yeah that was fantastic and i

468
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,000
think it really opens a huge

469
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,639
dialogue around you know what does the

470
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,560
relationship need to be between a

471
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,519
security team and security awareness

472
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,880
programs and not like humiliating and

473
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,279
and just becoming the bastard in your

474
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,759
organization i think is a great topic

475
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,519
and thank you so much for sharing your

476
