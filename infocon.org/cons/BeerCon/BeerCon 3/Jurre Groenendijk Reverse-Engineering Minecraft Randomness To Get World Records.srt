5
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,080
world records

6
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,280

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,000
away with corona but 19 year old um

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,680
scholar student studying computer

11
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,600
science and engineering at studio dels

12
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,240
my pronouns are he him

13
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,400
and i'm currently the owner of the

14
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,039
biggest minecraft co-op speedrunning

15
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,800
um

16
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,440
server in the world on discord

17
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,760
um we currently hold

18
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,000
between 40 and 70

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,600
world records

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,960
um

21
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,120
yeah that's it about me but before i get

22
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,039
started for some terminology and

23
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,559
starting info because

24
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,480
i assume some people in the audience

25
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,920
know exactly what half of those words

26
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,879
mean

27
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,640
so um

28
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,160
what is speed running

29
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,160
speed running is the art of trying to

30
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,120
finish a game as fast as possible

31
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,079
within speed running there are some

32
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,000
other terms like pb which is a personal

33
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,440
best

34
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,000
and wr world record which is the first

35
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,200
time anyone has ever beaten so far

36
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,280
then what is minecraft

37
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,640
a lot of us have probably grown up with

38
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,240
it but for people who don't know

39
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,159
minecraft is a

40
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,360
sandbox

41
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,640
um

42
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,080
yeah building mining crafting game

43
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,759
so it's kind of like an mmrpg where you

44
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,240
just go around you you can mine stuff

45
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,439
you can craft stuff like the name

46
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,759
implies but there's also combats there's

47
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:30,640
um

48
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,079
mobs loots dungeons everything

49
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,079
um

50
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,520
within minecraft there's a few things

51
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,759
that you can do for speedrunning

52
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,079
so there's uh the categories relevant to

53
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,439
us today are

54
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,000
uh any percent which is just beating the

55
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,799
game

56
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,040
which i will get back to in a bit and

57
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,600
minor chunk which is where you take a 16

58
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,360
by 16 area and mind the entire thing out

59
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,280
um within these categories is also

60
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,280
subcategories namely random see glitch

61
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,200
list where you create a random world you

62
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,479
have no idea what you're doing and you

63
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,000
just go in

64
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and set the english list where you get a

65
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,318
world that you've already chosen

66
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,639
beforehand and you you know exactly

67
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,160
where everything is that you just go in

68
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,239
and do everything as fast as possible

69
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,599
there's also for the any percent

70
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,599
category it's also filter t glitchless

71
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,680
which is where you get a world that you

72
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,280
have never seen before

73
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,959
but it is guaranteed to have the

74
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,120
features like the villages and the

75
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,640
portals and stuff in the right place

76
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,280
i talked about beating the game but what

77
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,080
exactly does that entail so there is

78
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,080
three dimensions within minecraft uh as

79
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,440
of right now

80
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,879
you have the overworld which is where

81
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,160
you spawn

82
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,239
and where you yeah when you start out

83
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,800
run around

84
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,120
then eventually you will make a nether

85
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,400
portal which will bring you to the

86
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,680
nether which is the second dimension

87
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,120
here

88
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,519
um and then last but not least you go

89
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,519
back to the overworld and then when you

90
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,040
find the stronghold you can go to the

91
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,120
end and within the end third dimension

92
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,440
here you can beat the ender dragon and

93
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,040
then when you kill the underdragon you

94
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,640
go into the portal

95
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,440
you've beaten the game

96
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,440
to get there there are a few steps you

97
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,720
need to go you can't just run to the

98
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,120
portal jump in and be done with it

99
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,000
so

100
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,239
to actually get to the portal and enter

101
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,879
it you need blade rods

102
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:19,680
so

103
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,200
which you can get from blazes within the

104
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,840
nether which are the top creatures and

105
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,440
the ender pearls which you get from

106
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,360
endermen which are the bottom creature

107
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,760
together you can combine those and they

108
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,599
make an eye vendor which will point

109
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,440
towards the stronghold and when you get

110
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,239
to the stronghold you can go to the end

111
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,519
and beat the game

112
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,400
this is a very crucial part

113
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,840
about

114
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,920
yeah about speedrunning

115
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,959
how do you find a stronghold so the

116
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,640
issue with finding a throttle is that

117
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,400
when you throw a pearl it will point you

118
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,080
towards the stronghold but

119
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,439
that's just a straight line and still

120
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,280
it's really hard to find it

121
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,400
so

122
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,920
the trick that i'm going to be talking

123
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,560
about today or one of the tricks

124
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,080
is this

125
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,799
there are fossils in the nether

126
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,200
and by looking at the position of the

127
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,480
fossil

128
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,360
you can actually find the location of

129
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,560
the stronghold without throwing or well

130
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,478
by well drastically reducing the amount

131
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,798
of pearl throw

132
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,639
when you actually get to the end uh you

133
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,240
can use a little trick where better blow

134
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,000
up if you sleep in them

135
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,720
and by clicking on the bed on the exact

136
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,560
the right timing

137
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,199
you can kill the underdragon just by

138
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,440
sleeping in a bed

139
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,600
while it is above you

140
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,120
um this is known as for bedding or five

141
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,080
bedding if you're worth it or

142
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,639
shakespearing like me um but yeah this

143
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,960
is just a little easter egg that just

144
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,120
turned into one of the most important

145
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,560
mechanics within minecraft speed running

146
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,960
um there's also some version differences

147
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,280
when it comes to speed running

148
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,040
namely pre 1.9 so before version 1.9

149
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,240
um

150
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,919
you had to actually kill enderman for

151
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,120
the ender pearls

152
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,520
between 1.9 and 1.15 villages uh

153
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,039
villagers got added and actually made

154
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,360
decent for trading so there instead of

155
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,960
killing under enderman for the pearls

156
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,000
you actually

157
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,560
um traded with villagers and then 116

158
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,280
plus which is the version that um

159
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,680
i'm talking about now or that

160
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,680
is most relevant to speedrunners today

161
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,160
is you actually go to a bastion uh

162
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,639
within another and you trade you partner

163
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,360
with the piglets there to get pearls

164
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,520
and i think the last bit of terminology

165
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,199
about minor chunk

166
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,919
uh where as i said you take a 16 by 16

167
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,320
area and you just completely mine it out

168
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,680
this is footage from one of our world

169
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,560
records

170
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,800
and you can just see a bunch of us just

171
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,600
happily mining away with our group

172
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,479
um

173
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,759
yeah and as you can see on the left

174
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,680
that's a 60 second area or a chunk and

175
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,800
that's the

176
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,919
yeah you start with a full one and you

177
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,280
just go

178
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,919
and it's empty

179
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,800
um all right now to go into my journey

180
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,280
as a speedrunner

181
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,759
so it started out when um i wasn't

182
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,560
university and i had a little bit of a

183
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,080
disagreement about how they thought

184
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,039
things

185
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,680
so within university discord i said hey

186
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,520
everybody at everyone

187
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,520
i'm going to give a

188
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,840
mini workshop on assembly

189
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,680
we have to do an assembly assignment for

190
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,759
this end of this week so

191
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,080
we'll we'll see how it goes um i'm gonna

192
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,280
be in the discord y'all can join if you

193
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,600
want i don't i don't mind

194
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,479
um

195
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,160
and that went on i did that for about

196
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,440
four hours and then halfway through i

197
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,160
got a message saying hey uh

198
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,039
we're at 150 people and we cannot fit

199
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,800
any more in the discord

200
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,960
so then my brother had to live stream my

201
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,600
discord to twitch to get everyone in

202
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,800
there and from that i had a little bit

203
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,720
of a following on yeah within the

204
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,800
university class of computer science

205
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,240
engineering cohort 20 uh 2020 2021

206
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,680
so

207
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,440
um yeah

208
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,840
one fateful evening after we were done

209
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,919
with some of our exams

210
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:00,880
um

211
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,880
we actually thought you know what we

212
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,479
have a bunch of people in here let's

213
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,720
just do a micro speed run

214
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,960
um within the speed running categories

215
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,400
there's like you can do it solo you can

216
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,880
do it with suit people three to four

217
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,960
five to nine or ten plus

218
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,160
and since 1.16 just released

219
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,080
and we did it with more than 10 people

220
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,919
or exactly 10

221
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,160
we were the very first person the very

222
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,840
first group to actually get or to

223
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,479
actually complete this category

224
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,759
and therefore we got a world record

225
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:32,639
um

226
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,080
that's done with my introduction to

227
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,160
speedrunning and we were like whoa

228
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,680
this is free

229
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,520
we can get a lot of these

230
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,680
so i made a separate discord

231
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,720
um

232
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,960
i invited a bunch of other speedrunners

233
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,759
and

234
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,280
uh well that grew out to be still the

235
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,039
discord that i used today for

236
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,599
uh for my co-speed runs

237
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,919
um and then about a few months later

238
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,319
once we were you know uh we were a

239
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,319
little bit burnt out on all the normal

240
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,240
80 percent speed running

241
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,319
we started thinking about minor chunk

242
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,400
and we started doing minor junk runs and

243
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,160
our minor chunk runs were

244
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,919
decent

245
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,759
but then

246
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,360
we started to get into minor chunk ssg

247
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,080
or chatseed glitchless

248
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,319
it's time to get technical

249
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,039
first off i want to give a big shout out

250
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,400
to these two people

251
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,160
on the left here we have neil i put a

252
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,919
little crown on his profile picture

253
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,840
because he's a king

254
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,560
this guy together with captain woodsex

255
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,240
set up the minecraft seat finding

256
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,240
libraries that we and most other

257
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,880
minecraft finders use today

258
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,120
and it has been amazing

259
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,760
and also this is henry on the right side

260
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,480
who actually has a um who actually

261
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,560
helped me and the other people with it

262
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,480
within this project figure out how

263
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,040
ravines work within minecraft

264
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,920
all right

265
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,800
so minecraft randomness minecraft when

266
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,000
you create a world you can enter a seed

267
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,360
you can enter letters as well but that

268
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,000
just turns it into numbers and it just

269
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,080
basically always makes it a 64-bit

270
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,600
number

271
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,279
that 64-bit number consists out of two

272
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,360
parts the structure seed which is the

273
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,839
left for the right most 48 bits and the

274
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,560
biom chip which is the left mode 16 bits

275
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,399
worlds with the same structure sheet

276
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,320
will have the exact same

277
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,440
structures

278
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,839
so villages

279
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,839
portal location ravine everything else

280
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,000
like that will always be the same

281
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,920
if a seed has the same structure sheet

282
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,720
we call those seeds sister seeds

283
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,320
then also the biome seeds and those

284
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,160
those bits get used for

285
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,399
generation of biomes terrain

286
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,800
mountains everything like that

287
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,040
so say you have a seat which has very

288
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,360
good uh location of the structure but

289
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,959
you know there's a giant hill in the

290
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,320
middle of everything

291
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,560
you can use you can just

292
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,920
make the biome sheet something different

293
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,959
while keeping the structure sheet the

294
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,760
same and you can get something else

295
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,120
all right

296
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,640
as i mentioned earlier neil made this

297
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,279
amazing library called feature utils

298
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,279
and feature utils

299
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,120
is amazing

300
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,040
before this existed we had to launch a

301
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,720
minecraft world hope it was a good seed

302
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,000
and try to see if we could find

303
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,920
something decent and that would take

304
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,040
hours

305
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,399
oh it would take

306
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,000
we have we would have like

307
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,760
tens hundreds of people trying to reset

308
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,760
to find a good seed for

309
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,560
any percent or minor junk or anything

310
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,920
really

311
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,399
but now with with the feature utils

312
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,160
you can just say okay

313
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,680
create

314
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,320
a world for 161 with this seed and tell

315
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,279
me

316
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,120
uh tell me the location of the four

317
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,360
villages in these regions and then we

318
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,360
just print it out to the console it

319
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,279
would simulate the random calls and it

320
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,959
would give the output

321
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,920
and then suddenly instead of this taking

322
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,760
i don't know a minute

323
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,360
it takes less than

324
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,320
say what

325
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,760
10 milliseconds to figure out the

326
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,160
location of four villages in any seat

327
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,079
it's changed everything we were suddenly

328
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,000
able to automate

329
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,440
and program

330
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,360
everything that we needed for

331
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,120
seed fighting well

332
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,279
not everything i'll get to that later

333
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,680
these are reveals

334
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,720
ravines

335
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,600
are

336
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,800
extremely useful for minor chunk runners

337
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,480
because as you can see

338
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,480
that is a lot of blocks that are not

339
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,760
there

340
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,160
it's a big gap in the world

341
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,000
but if you're doing minor chunk and if

342
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,600
this ravine goes through the middle of a

343
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,640
chunk

344
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,800
then suddenly you can cut away well

345
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,160
thousand two thousand three thousand

346
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,760
blocks just straight up out of your

347
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,959
chunk

348
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,279
that drastically reduces

349
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,800
the amount of time you need to mine

350
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,120
so they're a gold mine and we started

351
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,079
digging

352
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,360
is the code that then resent me about uh

353
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,120
reviews

354
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,040
so you could pass a random object it

355
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,040
would do some stuff with the

356
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,519
um with the position of the chunk

357
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,440
and it would say hey

358
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,720
is there

359
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,839
a

360
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:58,720
um

361
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,360
is there a veneer yes or no

362
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,320
this was huge this means for any chunk

363
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,480
in the world for any world

364
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,440
we can tell if they're a ravine or not

365
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,760
by just programming by just coding by

366
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,839
doing some yava it's it's

367
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,200
amazing

368
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,440
not only that

369
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,240
this code also contain the x y and z

370
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,880
offset so within the chunk so within the

371
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,720
16 by 16 area you also saw the exact

372
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,680
dial

373
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,000
or the exact block where it would uh

374
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,760
yeah it would generate

375
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,480
but also the yaw pitch

376
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,320
and more importantly

377
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,160
width

378
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,680
we could use

379
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,120
a we could find

380
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,440
the widths of the ravines that spawned

381
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,200
the direction they spawned in and

382
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,120
whether or not they spawn

383
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,200
this was amazing

384
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,720
so we started coding

385
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,600
we had um

386
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,760
we did a bunch of stuff just in pure

387
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,440
java with just our own code and neil's

388
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,600
code and then reach code

389
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,000
and we made a program that multithreaded

390
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,920
went through all the seeds

391
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,320
and tries to look okay can i find one

392
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,639
ravine that is decently wide another

393
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,560
ravine that is decently wide

394
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,959
do they intersect somewhere and

395
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,560
you know close enough that it's actually

396
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,480
useful

397
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,079
and if so

398
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,920
can we get some nice structure sheets

399
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,160
that are not from like world seeds so

400
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,720
that it is actually close to spawn

401
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,079
so here we combine all our knowledge so

402
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,440
far you know the structure sheets where

403
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,040
you would get the ravines the world

404
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,200
seeds where the spawn location change

405
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,560
and it would give us a bunch of seeds

406
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,600
together with the location where they

407
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,200
intersected

408
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,839
but this was still a lot of seats we had

409
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,560
thousands if not tens of thousands of

410
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,440
seats

411
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,839
to manually check and see how many

412
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,720
blocks are here is this a good spawn is

413
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,480
this decent you know it was a lot of

414
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,920
work

415
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,839
then we went on to part two you see

416
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,760
checker

417
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,199
so what uh what gullah and utroth two

418
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,760
people within our group actually did

419
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,199
is they made a um

420
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:04,880
they made a script that would straight

421
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,000
up call minecraft code in java

422
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,240
it would create a world

423
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,800
and it would

424
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,880
as you can see here it would call check

425
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,880
world and we'll check what would do it

426
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,240
would take the world and it would see

427
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,440
okay how many blocks are in here

428
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,680
and

429
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,880
yeah

430
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,160
that's it it would go through every

431
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,880
chunk through every 16 by 16 area around

432
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,680
uh

433
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,040
around the ravine

434
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,120
and it would see okay what's the best 16

435
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,720
by 16 area

436
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,720
that we can find

437
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,560
and it will be an output for example for

438
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,440
sheet 380 blah blah blah

439
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,519
we have a chunk that only has four

440
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,800
thousand blocks

441
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,600
within with x x coordinated thirty five

442
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,880
and that coordinates minus fifty

443
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,680
this is amazing

444
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,959
we found this with it

445
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,240
so there's a 16 by 16 area here

446
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,480
that is intersected

447
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,360
by five different ravines at least from

448
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,880
what we could tell

449
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,959
all going towards the same point in the

450
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,040
middle here

451
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,440
just got rid of a lot of blocks

452
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,959
and just to illustrate how many blocks

453
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,120
got rid of uh it got rid of

454
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,360
this is it side by side to a normal

455
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,120
minecraft chunks approximately 16 000

456
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,920
block

457
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,880
compared to our chunk

458
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,279
and eighty 3687 blocks

459
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,160
this was an enormous improvement for

460
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,079
minor chunk across the board

461
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,759
set seed run or well set seats uh solo

462
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,240
sets c go up sets the quads set c five

463
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,959
to nine sets c ten plus shattered within

464
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,279
a week

465
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,040
it ends up giving us this record

466
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,720
four minutes and thirteen seconds

467
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,320
that is how long it took

468
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,839
to mine out an entire chunk in minecraft

469
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,519
that is less than a third of the time

470
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,120
that i've been talking so far

471
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,360
this shattered everything but you can

472
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,639
ask yourself

473
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:05,600
how

474
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,800
how do we figure this all out

475
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,480
so as i said before neil is a king a god

476
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,880
an absolute shad within the world of

477
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,560
minecraft or at least within minecraft

478
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,720
speedrunning

479
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,440
within the old server we found uh he

480
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,480
made this which i i used the second one

481
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,880
the decompiler mc but these are all ways

482
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,959
that you can actually look at

483
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,399
minecraft code

484
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,000
and you can use mappings different

485
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,079
mappings and you can just see what it

486
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,399
says and how it works decompile it have

487
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,800
a look at how have a look at it

488
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,440
side note it is an absolute mess

489
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,920
trying to understand this stuff is

490
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,519
very tricky and sometimes you'll just

491
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,720
spend like

492
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,600
like three four five six out hours up to

493
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,480
days

494
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,079
looking at a piece of code trying to

495
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,360
figure out what is it doing and how

496
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,199
they're doing it just because you want

497
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,360
to make sure a chest spawns instead of

498
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,720
being overwritten by air for example

499
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,959
but now that we can read minecraft code

500
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,679
we can see this

501
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,359
this is the code for ravines that um

502
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,160
that then we found in um

503
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,679
in minecraft code it's actually called

504
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,679
canyons instead of ravines

505
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,280
and this is the official version of it

506
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,959
at the top you can see the

507
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,400
israelite on the next float is less than

508
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,160
0.02

509
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,439
um

510
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,199
which basically is you know does the

511
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,280
ravine spawn here and if it does then it

512
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,600
calls it guar function and then it will

513
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,760
give you the x y and z coordinates which

514
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,240
are d d2 and d3 it'll give you the yaw

515
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,679
and which and pitch which are f2 and f3

516
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,840
and it will give the length which is n7

517
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,039
so

518
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,600
it is definitely not legible

519
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,760
but if you do a bit of research try to

520
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,360
figure out what what

521
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,360
what goes where and what the variable

522
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,799
names actually mean

523
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,520
you can figure out what a thought is

524
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,480
so

525
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,400
back to the knee trick

526
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,240
stronghold

527
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,720
strongholds are procedurally generated

528
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,919
in rings

529
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,120
there are nine rings in total i think

530
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:07,919
and

531
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,919
um these rings generate around zero zero

532
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:12,799
um

533
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,720
and for example in the first ring there

534
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,799
will be three strongholds within twelve

535
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,640
hundred and twenty eight hundred blocks

536
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,080
from spawn

537
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,160
second ring is between four thousand and

538
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,000
six thousand there's six uh six drones

539
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,600
etcetera etcetera etcetera

540
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,039
we don't care

541
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,160
when you're speed running you want to be

542
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,000
as fast as possible and having to travel

543
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,080
all the way to a second ring stronghold

544
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,720
no way nobody does that we only care

545
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,440
about this first ring

546
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,640
uh which is good because limit

547
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,160
situations for us and it also makes the

548
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,640
programming a lot easier so there's a

549
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,400
few types that you can do to actually

550
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,480
find the stronghold

551
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,640
so as i said when you throw an ender

552
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,039
pearl it gives you an arrow straight

553
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,280
towards where the um where the throne

554
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,400
will be

555
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,160
so here is an example of how you would

556
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,600
travel to it

557
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,280
so you would draw a pearl travel

558
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,679
approximately that way you know go off

559
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,120
throw another one see how far they are

560
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,679
apart see what the angle distance is

561
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,360
um and just go all the way until it's

562
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,919
really close then go 90 degrees off your

563
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,200
path and throw another one and you can

564
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,600
triangulate it using the two yeah to

565
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,559
skew

566
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,400
point and then you found the throttle it

567
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,919
takes a long time

568
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,480
this is a lot of walking

569
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,039
so what people have figured out

570
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,080
is um an important note here

571
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,320
within the nether that second dimension

572
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,600
i'm talking about

573
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,000
every single block you travel actually

574
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,880
equates to eight blocks in the overworld

575
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,600
so

576
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,720
when you

577
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,400
um when you go into the nether when you

578
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,799
travel 100 blocks or 200 blocks

579
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,520
that in the overall actually 800 or 1600

580
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,240
blocks that cuts your time by eight

581
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,679
you know logically

582
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,120
so what people started doing is they

583
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,280
went into the into the nether tried to

584
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,960
find their uh their fortress and bastion

585
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,960
to get the blade rods and pearls

586
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,240
and then instead of traveling all the

587
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,280
way back

588
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,200
going out and then traveling all the way

589
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,440
to the to the fortress or to the um to

590
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,559
the stronghold

591
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,200
what they would do is they would go to

592
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,640
approximately a place that would bring

593
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,200
you to the ring place the portal

594
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,799
and pray

595
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:11,760
hope that you get close to the

596
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,120
strongholds

597
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,360
in some documented cases

598
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,159
people just randomly placed their portal

599
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,400
and got put right smack dab in the

600
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,159
center of the stronghold

601
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,919
like a few rooms away from the portal

602
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,440
room

603
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,200
um this was the meta for a while it

604
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,720
actually still is the meta because any

605
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,799
other method takes a little bit longer

606
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,640
but it's also

607
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,720
really inconsistent like if you have a

608
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,000
good blind you can be in the portal if

609
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,120
you're blocked away but if you have a

610
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,039
bad blind you can be up to 1300 blocks

611
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,080
away and that's

612
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,679
still really really bad if you have to

613
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,200
go out walk all the distance you know

614
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,880
your runs dead

615
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,720
so what people started doing is doing

616
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,159
estimated travel where they would leave

617
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,400
the portal throw a single pearl see okay

618
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,240
it's in this direction then go back to

619
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,080
the nether travel a few blocks a few

620
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,600
other blocks or whatever and then make

621
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,919
another portal and hope they're closer

622
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,280
uh then there's another one which is

623
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,799
calculated travel which is where you

624
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,760
would take

625
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,640
two pearls and uh you would very

626
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,320
carefully note down the coordinates and

627
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,120
the

628
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,960
angle of the intersection and hope you

629
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,840
know

630
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,000
see if it see if it works

631
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,880
um and then put it into a calculator and

632
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,640
because you have two lines they will

633
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,919
eventually meet somewhere and you can

634
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,280
actually calculate where the throttle

635
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,559
will be

636
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:21,760
but then

637
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,600
one fateful day

638
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,520
match you did and i quote

639
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,120
hacking invent of a threat

640
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,760
divine travel

641
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,440
people were calling this this because it

642
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,440
simply looked divine

643
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,440
made by the gods there's no way this

644
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,960
could make sense but somehow it does

645
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,880
to explain what this is i need to get

646
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,240
into the different kinds of random

647
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,520
minecraft users

648
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,760
so minecraft random object and chunk

649
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,559
rand

650
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:49,679
uses

651
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,600
a set seed like just any other random

652
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,120
object you can say okay this is the seed

653
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,240
and then all the random numbers that

654
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,559
come from it will always be the same

655
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:57,600
if you say

656
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,159
set seed one next number will be five if

657
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,440
you do it somewhere else in the other

658
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,039
side of the world set seed one next

659
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,679
number will still be five

660
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,440
they also have a thing called set garber

661
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,679
sheet which you can use to

662
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,280
get a specific random number for every

663
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,159
chunk so it will be different per world

664
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,080
seed per chunk

665
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,080
but it will always be the same for that

666
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,600
chunk for that world

667
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,880
then there's also set terrain seed

668
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,320
population seed decorated seed feature

669
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,520
seed there's a bunch of other stuff but

670
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,360
we will not be going into that now

671
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,880
we just have to look at that garbage

672
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,480
sheet

673
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,440
set garbage sheet takes the world seed

674
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,480
um

675
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,919
puts that on a random object this is

676
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,760
within a random object

677
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,000
creates two next longs

678
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,679
multiplies those by the chunk a and

679
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:40,720
chunk z

680
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,640
and then xors those two numbers with the

681
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,039
world seed and then set that as the c

682
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,720
that's like the actual seed that gets

683
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,559
used for the random thing

684
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,400
it sounds really complex

685
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,720
but what match you figured out

686
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,559
is that if you put the chunk x and chunk

687
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,880
z at exactly zero so if you're within

688
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,799
the chunk zero zero

689
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,799
then the actual final calculation this

690
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,400
one for seed

691
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,120
will be zero times something

692
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,440
xor zero times something x extra world

693
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,200
seed or

694
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,360
just world seed

695
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,919
so what a set garbage sheet call at

696
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,679
chunk zero zero does

697
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,400
is exactly the same as just setting the

698
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,320
seed to the world seed that is the most

699
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,840
important thing to take away from here

700
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,840
and if you look at the codes for

701
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,520
fossils which are those things i showed

702
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,039
before

703
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,559
um

704
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,039
it calls the shed garber seed with the

705
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,039
structure sheet and then the chunk x

706
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,640
trunk g and then it does a random call

707
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,640
again at chunk zero zero that will just

708
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,919
be the same as saying seed world seed

709
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,760
for the ravines it does the exact same

710
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,279
thing there's a plus one here but that's

711
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,919
that's semantics you can ignore that

712
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,000
that also has the same effect as just

713
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,679
setting it to the world seat

714
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,039
and as you can see

715
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,400
it goes for the strongholds the

716
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,080
generation of the strongholds and like

717
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,200
the placement for those three

718
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,200
strongholds within the ring

719
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,080
is shedding the seed to the world seed

720
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,840
and then it calls the next double which

721
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,279
gives you the random number between zero

722
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,720
and one

723
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,960
and multiplies that by

724
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,520
um by two pi to get an

725
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,919
angle within the in radian within the

726
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,120
circle

727
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,720
so by looking at the x coordinate

728
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,840
of a four though at chunk zero zero

729
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,400
you can directly map that

730
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,760
to the angle

731
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,960
of the stronghold within the first ring

732
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,159
and also the second and the third

733
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,440
stronghold because they're always

734
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,840
equally spaced apart so you can add

735
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,600
a circle divided by three and it will be

736
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,000
like you know one here one ear one here

737
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,320
so they will be equally spaced apart

738
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,480
same works for ravines however that is a

739
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,760
little less consistent but it's also

740
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,440
something that i found out

741
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,720
at 0 0 if a ravine spawns we know that

742
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,960
the angle will be less than 0.02

743
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,360
this is amazing this gives us a way to

744
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,120
look where the stronghold is without

745
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,840
throwing any pearls whatsoever

746
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,400
and people started making charge for it

747
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,760
so

748
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,799
um

749
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,240
yeah if you find a fossil with x

750
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,080
coordinate zero then your first divine

751
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,400
location is in another two five one

752
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,240
fifty

753
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,880
and people started using this

754
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,960
many of these charts started popping up

755
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,320
and by god did it work

756
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,400
because a few weeks later

757
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,840
this run was had by brent

758
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,480
dilba nine minutes and 38 seconds

759
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,320
by using the vine travel

760
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,720
you can see here uh he pauses game looks

761
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,080
at the um

762
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,200
looks at the fossil and the fossil is at

763
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,400
let's see

764
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,720
expedition eight within chunk zero zero

765
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,159
which you can see here but it's a little

766
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,559
bit illegible but it's expedition eight

767
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:47,919
so he went to the chart looked up for

768
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,960
expedition eight and made a portal

769
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,600
somewhere close to the coordinates

770
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,120
and he spawned

771
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,080
right in the middle of the stronghold

772
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,960
no enderpearl's throne no triangulation

773
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,200
no calculated travel straight up divine

774
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,480
travel

775
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,799
sprayed went in there and

776
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,000
shattered

777
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,480
the world record

778
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,919
second place our first place before the

779
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,240
run was 11 minutes and 7 seconds in game

780
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,279
time

781
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:16,960
this guy didn't cut off

782
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,039
a minute

783
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,200
not a minute 15 seconds he got off

784
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,960
one and a half minutes

785
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,279
from the time he shattered the 11 minute

786
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,360
barrier he shattered the 10 minute 30

787
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,039
barrier he shattered the 10 minute

788
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,039
barrier he shattered 9 45 and went

789
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,400
straight for the 936

790
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,559
that's my talk i want to give a quick

791
