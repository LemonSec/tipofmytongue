1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,960
and welcoming david carson uh mental

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,040
health the good the bad and the

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,480
unobtainable

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,040
i see where you're going with this david

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,360
so why don't you share your screen and

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,559
uh rock on as they are as we say cool so

7
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:15,360
yeah

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,600
this says mental health the good the bad

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,920
and obtainable

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,680
so yeah i'm going to be discussing

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,519
mental health as such some of the

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,599
content may be triggering

13
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,519
it's going to try and make it short and

14
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,599
sweet it's only 15 minutes so i'm going

15
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,439
to try and cover as much as possible so

16
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:32,800
i'm not going to be going too deep in

17
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,280
anything but i'm going to touch on

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,360
substance use and make mention of eating

19
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,440
disorder

20
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,280
but won't be discussing things in any

21
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,559
depth and

22
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,559
i will be referring to notes but largely

23
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:45,920
trying to keep it as unscripted as

24
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,840
possible so i'm going to do my best not

25
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,520
to embarrass myself for our hosts

26
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,960
so who am i i'm david uh i'm not in any

27
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,399
way qualified to be speaking about

28
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,640
mental health but so do your own

29
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,120
research and speak to a doctor i'm just

30
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,280
coming at this from my own perspective

31
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,760
i've kind of been

32
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,200
dealing with mental health most of my

33
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,040
adult life kind of struggled with

34
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,360
depression a lot kind of

35
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,000
especially teens early twenties

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,240
i had a stint on excess our eyes and

37
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,640
kind of feel like i've wasted actually

38
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,640
sorry i lost kind of a lot of my life to

39
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,159
mental health

40
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,880
but more recently i've had a bit of fast

41
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,439
and with kind of burnout anxiety panic

42
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,799
attacks

43
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,320
and ended up with beta blockers

44
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,759
i feel like i've kind of given mental

45
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,680
health a fair shot but largely found

46
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,200
it's

47
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,240
a bit broken to be honest and really not

48
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,880
that helpful so i'm glad some it works

49
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,000
for some people and

50
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,920
but yeah i think it's pretty broken but

51
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,079
i do think there's hope for

52
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,159
so i'm going to cover that in a bit

53
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,119
oh yeah working i work in infosec

54
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:55,840
so

55
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,920
i love infosec but

56
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,840
i think mental health and infosec do

57
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,040
kind of go hand in hand together

58
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,799
i love that we're in such a kind of

59
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,040
neurodiverse industry there's

60
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,479
room for everyone here

61
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,679
but i think if you're coming into

62
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,400
infosec and you don't really have mental

63
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,319
health issues there's

64
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,000
potentially some factors that might not

65
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,560
be so kind on your mental health we are

66
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,319
kind of very paranoid and you sing

67
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,079
problem focused industry

68
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,239
so yeah data breaches we just kind of

69
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,080
got to the point that

70
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,879
they're fact of modern life

71
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,440
and we just kind of accepted that and

72
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,120
we're in the front lines

73
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,800
which

74
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,120
i don't know not the nicest at times

75
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,920
as

76
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,360
gabe touched on yesterday some of the

77
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,920
language we use like assume breach zero

78
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,440
trust

79
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,760
and mentioned earlier we're doomed uh

80
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,599
kill chain

81
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,400
like

82
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,879
we do like our military terms we kind of

83
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,959
talk a lot about where like as if we're

84
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,319
at war

85
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,560
but for fighting somebody that's

86
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,319
invisible that we can't see that

87
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,319
it can be about a struggle and

88
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,680
just need to be aware of these things

89
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,280
i'm not saying we should try and change

90
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,840
the language we use just

91
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,920
be aware how some of these things might

92
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,480
be influencing your own health

93
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,720
and yeah we know too much like we can't

94
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,040
use facebook no sorry meta

95
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,480
without

96
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,920
worrying about the privacy tradeoffs

97
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,239
we're making like black friday's coming

98
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,920
up and

99
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,280
years and years ago i would have loved

100
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,840
to invest in like all these smart

101
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,400
devices the

102
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,360
smart speakers the doorbell cameras but

103
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,280
now they just end up seeing a bit creepy

104
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,200
can't really relax around these things

105
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,959
as much as

106
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,480
a lot of other people would i guess

107
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,879
that's the kind of ignorance is bliss

108
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,400
and i think someone's in industry have

109
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,439
actually unfortunately seen too much and

110
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,200
some things have been seen that can't be

111
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,879
unseen and that brings with it some

112
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,959
trauma

113
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,720
so i'm coming at things from a kind of

114
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,400
blue team perspective and it's very much

115
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,120
not

116
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,000
if

117
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,159
if you're breached it's when

118
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,840
very much kind of on the defensive

119
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,680
trying to communicate something that

120
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,160
might seem obvious that's

121
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,079
a big threat

122
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,079
to the organization but

123
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,240
people might not care they might not be

124
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,600
interested

125
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,880
they might just think it's not their

126
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,520
problem and sometimes you're kind of in

127
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,160
a position of being i guess the i.t

128
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,240
police which could be quite alienating

129
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,600
from

130
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,000
your colleagues

131
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,240
just sometimes you're

132
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,280
i guess it could be strained

133
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,840
relationships

134
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,160
and also you're limited to what you can

135
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,759
talk about there's a lot of things that

136
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,520
you come across and you just want to

137
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,120
show from the rooftops but you can't

138
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,120
i think much the same if you're from the

139
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,960
red team i'm

140
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,479
personally got no experience in that

141
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,720
side of things but

142
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,320
having spoken to some of my friends that

143
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,160
work on that side

144
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,000
advocating and things for that can have

145
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,639
hacking experience that dopamine hit

146
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,680
popping shells but they end up writing

147
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,199
reports

148
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,240
focusing again on negative things

149
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,880
and maybe not so much recently but a lot

150
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,400
of travels living up suitcases

151
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,199
and then there's infosec twitter

152
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,639
i'm not going to shouldn't emphasize

153
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,320
twitter it's great it says what you make

154
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,320
it but that could have always been

155
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,479
connected

156
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,280
it can be hard as well

157
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,720
you're getting

158
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,720
information overload a lot of the time

159
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,199
it's that intersection between

160
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,160
social and work

161
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,600
that can kind of sometimes blur the

162
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,320
boundaries of when work and play can

163
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,720
start and stop

164
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,840
but

165
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,800
yeah

166
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,720
i think very much infosec twitter or

167
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,400
twitter in general it's like any other

168
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,880
community there's drama just try not to

169
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,800
get sucked into it

170
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,360
use the mute list use the block list and

171
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,720
focus on the things you like it's

172
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,759
actually

173
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,440
relatively recently i reached out on

174
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,039
twitter just saying

175
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,080
i'm not okay and i was actually kind of

176
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,840
blown away with some of the reactions i

177
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,000
got and the messages of support i got

178
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,800
like

179
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,479
people that i didn't even advise on

180
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,400
radar reaching out saying

181
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,319
i'm here if you're on a chat it's great

182
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,759
so

183
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,360
just be wary and take breaks and

184
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,160
don't over indulge

185
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:44,709
[Music]

186
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,120
it could be a glass of wine after work

187
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,319
it could be

188
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,919
a beer

189
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,199
it could be

190
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,520
can't even like

191
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,440
there's a lot of substances out there

192
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,680
there's

193
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,919
some illicit some not solicit some

194
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:06,319
glamorized some acceptable

195
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,639
i think just be wary of how these things

196
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,039
are influencing you

197
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:11,840
and

198
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,360
kind of your energy levels if you've

199
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,599
already got mental health issues

200
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,599
energy can often be

201
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,560
a factor so if you're taking something

202
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,840
or i guess doing something that's

203
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,919
messing with your energy levels just

204
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,280
be aware of it

205
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,720
and speaking of which

206
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,319
work can be advice if you've got

207
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,440
problems that you don't want to deal

208
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,680
with works a great escape you just throw

209
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,360
yourself into

210
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,599
ignore your responsibilities at home

211
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,840
ignore your responsibilities elsewhere

212
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,080
forget about your own mental health just

213
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,120
plunge into work it's not healthy don't

214
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,319
do it set boundaries take a break

215
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,319
use holidays

216
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,479
but i'm not going to tell you what all

217
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,160
these things you already know like we

218
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,400
all know you should be healthy get

219
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,280
exercise

220
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,520
these kind of things that can but it can

221
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,960
often be easier said than done

222
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,840
like

223
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,280
there's people out there just physically

224
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,120
not able to do a lot of the exercise

225
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,120
that will be recommended to them

226
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,280
i've tried to get into running i've

227
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,919
done many ends

228
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,840
talking to people sometimes if you've

229
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,759
spent a lot of time masking your issues

230
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:20,879
it could be

231
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,160
really hard to kind of break through

232
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,000
that mask and

233
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,639
yeah it's not that easy but

234
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,240
there's hope

235
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,560
and yeah that's not really hope that's

236
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,880
just headlines that's

237
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,599
apologies to international audience but

238
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,799
yeah i saw this last week and i thought

239
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,039
yes progress it's

240
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,039
so i thought put it in here because i

241
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,880
want to talk about some of the kind of

242
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,800
amazing research that's being done in

243
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,959
the space of psychedelics

244
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,040
so like john hopkins university in the

245
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,120
states

246
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,160
they've done some really amazing work

247
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,640
around depression

248
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,720
palliative care and cancer patient

249
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,480
patients

250
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,200
helping people stop smoking really that

251
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,839
what they've done could be a 45-minute

252
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,440
talk by itself

253
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,200
so i just checked them out one of the

254
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,880
highlights says

255
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,720
a depression study where after one

256
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,920
treatment 54 of their patients were in

257
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,000
remission a month later and if you've

258
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,560
been on ssris you'll know that a month

259
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,920
later you're just trying to find your

260
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,320
new baseline never mind feeling better

261
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,399
so this is

262
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,959
the treatment room for

263
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,640
imperial college in london who are

264
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,399
actually just now currently recruiting

265
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,800
for a psilocybin study on anorexia

266
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,839
and

267
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,279
this thought is quite interesting

268
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,519
feature there because a big part of the

269
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,440
psychedelics

270
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,560
how they're being used is about your

271
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,160
mindset going into these things and

272
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,880
setting your tail then

273
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,560
so you can see the room is quite new age

274
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,399
it's not quite in clinical and i think

275
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,320
that presents a bit of a challenge for

276
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,880
some of our regular tree framework

277
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,440
because how do you account for crystal

278
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,720
salt lamps and

279
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,360
forest murals in the walls

280
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,880
so imperial are actually doing some

281
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,640
really amazing research as well they've

282
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,519
done they're looking into using

283
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,640
dmt to depression they've done

284
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,120
self-blinding citizens science studies

285
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,040
on microdosing

286
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,279
which is taking us the perceptive amount

287
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,440
of substance

288
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,320
and

289
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,120
actually stanford are now teaching an

290
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,360
introduction to psychedelic medicine

291
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,040
which i think shows kind of the

292
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,560
direction that

293
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,760
mental health is heading because

294
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,200
but it's not just

295
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,000
stanford it's not just one imperial it's

296
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
all over the world there's

297
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,640
king's college in london again there's

298
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,880
cairo university in egypt

299
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,839
seoul national hospital in south korea

300
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,920
there's even the catholic university of

301
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,560
the sacred heart in italy and if you're

302
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,959
in the uk you can actually get now get

303
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,560
paid for ketone therapy on the nhs which

304
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,600
is

305
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,680
change shows how the times are changing

306
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,800
just

307
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,200
if you're suffering from like alcoholism

308
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,800
ptsd depression anxiety

309
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,279
i'm not saying go experiment just

310
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,200
look into some of the studies are going

311
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,720
and there's a lot of these studies being

312
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,320
recruited for

313
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,640
and it's

314
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,640
using substances have largely been

315
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,920
demonized like mdma ketamine mushrooms

316
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,480
psilocybin dmt

317
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,000
that kind of thing so it's 2021 what can

318
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,680
we do just now

319
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,800
the days are getting shorter

320
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,480
at least in this part of the world it's

321
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,120
dark it's rainy

322
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,600
seasonal can disorders start taking over

323
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,720
so

324
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,560
just remember to take a break from your

325
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,320
screen

326
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,160
get some hobbies that aren't computer

327
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,000
related

328
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,600
actually related

329
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,480
take vitamin d for many reasons and get

330
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,399
outside

331
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,600
so

332
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,959
actually if i was researching this

333
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,040
subject matter for this talk i've always

334
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,680
felt that getting outside it's one thing

335
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,920
wandering around in a city

336
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,320
but getting in touch with nature is

337
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,399
really beneficial and it turns out

338
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,600
there's studies that prove that

339
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,200
i've got no clue how i'm doing on time

340
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,720
so i'm not going to get too much into

341
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,000
depth because some other stuff i want to

342
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,360
cover but

343
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,440
yeah basically a japanese study showed

344
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,839
that that wondering about the forest

345
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,800
will lower cortisol it will lower

346
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,519
your pulse rate your lower pressure and

347
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,880
really do your world of good

348
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,160
but i think the thing that's helped me

349
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,800
most has probably been this man this man

350
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,480
has probably done more for me than a

351
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,320
doctor and he's actually

352
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,399
done a lot to kind of challenge medical

353
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,600
science

354
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,360
if you don't know who he is he's wim

355
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,240
hoff

356
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,760
he's

357
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,639
a dutch kind of breathing practitioner i

358
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:01,760
guess

359
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,519
uh he's

360
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,279
taken a lot from kind of hinduism and

361
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,920
other cultures to develop his own kind

362
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,040
of breathing and

363
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,440
kind of cold exposure

364
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,959
methodology i guess

365
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,680
and some of his works actually rewritten

366
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,320
textbooks that it's showing that

367
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,800
human body can or

368
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,800
basically train volunteers to control

369
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,720
their own immune systems under lab

370
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,399
conditions

371
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,200
so

372
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,200
i got into his breath work after those

373
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,600
things and benefits and

374
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,600
you guys friends and family

375
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,800
who've

376
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,360
done it and

377
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,440
a partner actually says she notices

378
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,680
difference if i skip a day

379
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,800
so this is how i start with my days it's

380
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,079
breath work

381
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,279
there's

382
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,680
a few different ways you can do it i

383
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,680
personally started with

384
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,839
the wim hof youtube channel where he

385
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,360
takes you through

386
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,639
basically taking 30 to 40 deep breath

387
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,720
you're exhaling very forcefully you're

388
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,959
trying to fill up your lungs and on the

389
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,360
last breath you completely empty your

390
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,560
lungs

391
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,199
and then you're just hold your breath

392
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,360
and just hold it until you feel urged to

393
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,639
breathe again

394
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,720
aims not to hold your breath that aims

395
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,639
to breathe but

396
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,000
you can quite comfortably hold your

397
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,720
breath for two minutes

398
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,199
without much practice

399
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,199
and it just kind of helps clear your

400
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,880
head it gives you this kind of cam

401
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,160
feeling

402
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,760
and i think it really actually sets me

403
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,279
up for the day

404
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,040
so

405
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,120
three pictures there and

406
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,720
one is

407
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,839
youtube video one is

408
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,839
the wim hof app which i'm currently

409
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,480
using that's a paid for subscription and

410
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,720
other is there free from debris

411
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,680
which is probably going to use once the

412
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,079
subscription for the official wim hof

413
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,399
app expires

414
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,040
uh but yeah give it a shot there's

415
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,880
actually a lot of physical conditions

416
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,959
this can really benefit as well so i'd

417
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,279
recommend looking into it

418
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,639
and

419
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,560
give it a shot one morning and i think

420
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,519
it

421
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,519
hopefully helped i find it really sets

422
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,279
me up for the day and gives me a nice

423
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,199
nice clam

424
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,639
feeling

425
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,079
hey but

426
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,040
yeah thank you very much and

427
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,880
i guess we all have habits uh some

428
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,720
mental health so i've got one takeaway

429
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,519
just

430
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,120
make sure the good ones outweigh the bad

431
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,560
thank you very much that is

432
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,560

434
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
i've ever heard yeah

435
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,199
hands down

436
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,959

439
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,680
in the chat for for david's uh you can

440
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,199
catch him on the if you if you want to

441
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,880
you can catch him on the discords i'm

442
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,279
sure he'll be hanging around there

443
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,279
but if you see david around buying pink

444
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,959
he's an awesome guy

445
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,519
i owe him about 20 30. i think the tabs

446
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,839
up to about 40 now i think yeah i think

447
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,240
the uh the key point here is that there

448
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,480
isn't anybody watching this including

449
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,560
the people in this studio yeah

450
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,759
that um

451
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:20,959
don't

452
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,720
won't benefit from everything that

453
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,759
you've said

454
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,160

important information

456
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,839
uh and the comments are just flooding in

457
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,160
