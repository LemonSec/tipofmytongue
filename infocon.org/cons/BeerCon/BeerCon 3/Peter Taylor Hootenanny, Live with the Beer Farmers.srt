1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,040
peter welcome to beercon 3.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,040
glad to be invited we

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,040
oh you're very welcome to be here so we

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,200
are we got into contact with each other

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,400
a month or two back then we were

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,480
chatting we were chewing the fat about

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,160
punk rock yeah

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,079
and you and i have a shared passion for

9
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,320
it uh and i think people might think you

10
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,400
are an ex-punk rocker but you're never

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,240
an ex-punk are you you're a punk

12
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,000
throughout your entire life it's a way

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,880
of life

14
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,400
being a bit punk

15
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,720
um absolutely and the reason yeah the

16
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,960
reason we or when we started chatting it

17
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,680
became really apparent that we had some

18
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,399
quite some similar journeys

19
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,239
around going from a previous existence

20
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,480
uh and then eventually into cyber

21
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,280
security yeah and your story your story

22
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,280
is quite interesting because it for me

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,480
personally because it resonates a little

24
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,719
bit with my journey as well

25
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,640
and so i thought it'd be great to bring

26
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,960
you along for a quick chat just to hear

27
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,039
a bit about that story you know

28
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,320
obviously we'll chip in and ask

29
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,760
questions and you can ask us questions

30
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,239
if you like but um it's over to you yeah

31
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,640
well i entered cyber security at the age

32
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,840
of 59 so the best i can hope for

33
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,280
um is to be

34
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,640
you know he's like peter cushing who

35
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,200
became an actor in his 50s

36
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,560
i tried to avoid it forever

37
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,320
you know anything inside or anything

38
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,600
computers

39
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,799
and so the journey for me

40
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,840
which actually has lasted me my life and

41
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,920
my career is we've been

42
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,920
falling in love with punk rock

43
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,360
and i grew up in the sixties

44
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,240
um i had an elder sister and when we

45
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,240
used our sleepovers with me mates when

46
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,600
we were about eight

47
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,320
we rated up posters of uh footballers

48
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,360
and

49
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,520
spitfire planes and

50
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,399
uh the apollo 8 mission you know that

51
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,720
type of thing on my wall it was brian

52
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,840
jones from the

53
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,680
stones jimi hendrix

54
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,479
and that's that's what i was into um

55
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,200
love me rock music love glam rock

56
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,880
and then after clam rock we got this

57
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,960
awful horrible

58
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,119
music where the

59
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,598
14 minute singles

60
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,680
you know whereas for me the perfect

61
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,920
i'm a rocker i want it three minutes

62
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,280
long

63
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,879
um and then i want them to give me

64
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,720
another song

65
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,640
i don't want the same song to last for

66
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,040
14 minutes and i think i spend my career

67
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,080
doing that

68
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,480
um which we can get onto but i think

69
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,120
your real interest probably is that

70
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,080
um

71
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,000
the i was there

72
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,519
you know when things happened like the

73
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,640
sex pistols and the free plus a free

74
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,440
i think i'm the only monk union rocker

75
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,480
that will admit to not being there

76
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,560
and i think that's far cooler there were

77
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,239
40 people at the first gig and then

78
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,239
about 100 at the second gig

79
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,800
and when malcolm mclaren

80
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,160
yeah

81
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,239
the myth around that is is significant

82
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,000
because the manchester music scene began

83
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,080
on the back of the sex pistols june the

84
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,080
4th 76th

85
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,319
and uh the lesser free trade hull

86
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,480
it got to the point where so many people

87
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,159
had claimed they'd witnessed that gig

88
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,319
and then it's spawned their own musical

89
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,640
career that we're all lying yeah they

90
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,800
were never there a guy actually wrote a

91
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,800
book about it called i swear i was there

92
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,519
but there were a few people yeah well uh

93
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,080
and pete shelley who'd organized it

94
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,760
we're definitely there i think there

95
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,840
were more people at the second gig and i

96
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,760
know people like peter hulk with the you

97
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,920
know were there and i know peter i don't

98
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,400
know he was a friend but i knew him when

99
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,400
i was a punk rocker and he was a really

100
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,560
good guy and i'm sure he he wouldn't

101
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,959
need to say he wasn't he was there

102
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,159
um but yeah it did spawn stuff but my

103
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,360
argument is

104
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,120
it was already there

105
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,840
it was um a dissatisfaction

106
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,120
with

107
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,360
you know platform shoes

108
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,480
uh

109
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,080
a-line flares mustaches and medallions

110
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,480
um and

111
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,959
the music disco sucks yeah yeah and um

112
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,519
crap music like slick being put out

113
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,000
scott you know it was awful

114
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,080
uh rick wick with an emerson left

115
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,480
apartment a lot of us stopped wearing

116
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,519
flares

117
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,238
started wearing um cheap clothes from

118
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,399
army and navy stores

119
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,320
didn't have curly perms

120
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,479
and we were looking for something and we

121
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,160
found it

122
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,080
when you started to you know when you

123
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,600
see bands like joy division uh the fall

124
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,639
um and everybody else my first punk rock

125
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,919
on that i actually saw was the damned

126
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,520
um who

127
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,639
just absolutely did it for me so fast

128
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,800
so rocky uh but i didn't go out

129
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,240
overnight and

130
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,639
go and get me curly perm caught into a

131
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,800
you know a mohican

132
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,280
it was a more of a gradual thing really

133
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,120
and he did become part of a scene a lot

134
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,840
of it was through pubs manchester pubs

135
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,680
and the city road didn't get a lot of

136
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,919
mention in books but for some reason

137
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,600
nobody mentions a book called the gay

138
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,919
thought

139
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,039
which

140
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,440
was around the corner from

141
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,880
the tjm

142
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,759
studios where we all used to rehearse

143
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,360
um but if you you saw people in the pubs

144
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,199
they looked a bit like you

145
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,000
so you nodded to them you spoke to them

146
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,479
and you didn't always like them

147
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,880
and then tgm studios did it all that was

148
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,919
a massively massive warehouse bought by

149
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,160
the sort of a jeweler

150
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,320
who became tj music which i think you

151
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,199
know

152
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,240
mike

153
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,440
is that is that tj davidson

154
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,120
interesting little factories about that

155
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,720
for people i've got two factories one

156
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,120
one of them is only because i know you

157
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,720
so if you've ever seen the video for

158
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,800
love will terrorist apart by generation

159
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,919
it's got

160
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,840
it's it's got a scene at the end at the

161
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,560
beginning and the end of a door opening

162
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,560
and closing with a hand that comes out

163
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,400
and shuts it

164
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,319
it's also got a and c i was going to say

165
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,759
that's probably slower than the dogs

166
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,160
breaking in to steal things

167
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,840
it could have been but it's got e and c

168
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,400
written in felt it pen on the door

169
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,880
i assume he's ian curtis right well that

170
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,360
is in tj davidson's rehearsal complex

171
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,919
the one that that pete's talking about

172
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,199
the second thing is the secret of

173
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,120
letting out the back

174
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,800
pete's band you can tell us a little bit

175
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,960
about that band actually supported your

176
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,440
division how [ __ ] cool is that that's

177
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,199
pretty cool that's for all the hipsters

178
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,199
out there i was gonna say i i was there

179
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,039
before it was cool unknown pleasures

180
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,759
t-shirts yeah this guy was in that world

181
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,680
wow well i was um

182
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,919
a big thing for me as well was um i was

183
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,319
a member of rock against racism

184
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,080
uh so part of the reason for forming the

185
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,160
band was to raise funds for rock and

186
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,600
gauge racism

187
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,360
and we played bolton institute of

188
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,039
technology

189
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,599
with joy division and there were about

190
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,759
600 people there

191
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:54,960
um

192
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,479
we actually went down better than joy

193
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,880
division

194
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,120
but the truth of that story is that the

195
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,639
reason we went down better than joy

196
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,960
division is because when we got there

197
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,280
um i think peter hook um i can't

198
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,160
remember

199
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,680
the drama golden summer or something

200
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,759
like that i felt sorry for us

201
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,319
so i learned hockey lent me his baby and

202
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,080
his amps

203
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,039
and

204
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,199
hooky did the sound for us instead of

205
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,759
our roader who was just the piss head

206
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,560
but a really good lad on a night out

207
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,360
and they even said to us

208
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,720
uh do you want me out with your light

209
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,880
show we went what light show so they

210
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,639
gave us a light show

211
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,720
and that was the best gig we'd ever

212
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,720
bloody played we had the and again it

213
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,479
was a dream it was a

214
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,240
potential rock star that you know there

215
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,080
were kids grabbing you grabbing at your

216
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,560
legs and all that sort of stuff uh we

217
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,560
did some of our own numbers

218
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,720
uh the audience was a very sort of clash

219
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,319
type audience

220
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,240
uh clash and pistols type audience

221
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,240
where's your division

222
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,319
by by comparison

223
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,120
for that audience with a little bit arty

224
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,680
and um

225
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,560
we sounded great we played great

226
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,199
um and then we kind of like finished

227
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,360
after 20 minutes the audience wanted

228
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,319
more

229
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,400
uh joy division will let him willing to

230
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,319
let us give them some more

231
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,080
and um

232
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,400
i didn't know any more songs

233
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,840
so on stage the guitarist taught me a

234
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,960
song called 1977 by the clash on stage

235
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,000
in front of the [ __ ] audience

236
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,800
yeah

237
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,199
and then we played it as our encore and

238
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,958
then we did clash c rockers which i

239
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,880
didn't know but i only knew it because i

240
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,320
know i explained by the who

241
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,519
you know lots of plagiarism going on

242
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,599
and it was the best night of our lives

243
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,160
and um joy division went on it was near

244
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,080
the end curtis wasn't having a great

245
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,240
time at the time to be fair i thought

246
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,959
they were absolutely brilliant

247
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,880
we got interviewed by the punk magazines

248
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,399
and the punk magazines actually put out

249
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,760
this was the night of the curves and

250
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,519
that type of stuff

251
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,600
um i haven't got a cup i've got a couple

252
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,360
people somewhere but one of the journals

253
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,240
wrote us up and said

254
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,000
the kerbs don't know if they performed

255
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,480
that night or been played gigging for

256
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,440
three years uh they went down the storm

257
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,839
uh but they probably wouldn't work on

258
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,839
vinyl well we wouldn't work on vinyl it

259
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,279
was a bloody gig

260
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,360
you

261
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,800
we know there

262
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,399
to play a gig and that's all we wanted

263
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,000
to do was play gigs it was fast

264
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,279
disposable

265
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,160
and we just wanted to be there and

266
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,360
enjoy it

267
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,600
and be part of it

268
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,600
and it was and we ended up being

269
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,880
disposable

270
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,880
so yeah and that's what that was what

271
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,880
that was the ethic of paul yeah it was

272
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,279
fast and disposable and different

273
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,959
just in the last four or five minutes

274
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,959
that we've got just uh because there'll

275
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,160
be people out there going yeah we get

276

actually are up to now um the stuff that

281
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,160
i'm doing at the moment is uh i'm i'm

282
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,880
too old um to go and sort of improve my

283
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,560
coding skills and get loads and loads of

284
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,440
certificates so mainly i'm adapting my

285
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,160
own knowledge of behavioral psychology

286
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,040
um good business process

287
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,000
uh and use of technology rather than

288
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,760
you know and i'll be helping to improve

289
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,320
it so i'm working with tech companies

290
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,760
um to test i i'm i'm not so much you

291
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,120
know like you've got your pen testers

292
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,959
and you test all the software

293
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,640
i just sit there and go through it and

294
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,560
say this is how i'm gonna get around it

295
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,279

this is how i'm going to rip you off

297
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,920
this is how i'm going to write the

298
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,760
system so i'm sort of like the criminal

299
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,959
mind

300
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,279

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,600
that the criminals do i'm not a criminal

302

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,360
those people were going to go on

328
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,519
and make a huge difference so what i

329
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,600
will say inside and but the other thing

330
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,240
it was very like the infosec community

331
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,240
is you could it was one of the most

332
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,399
helpful supportive people you know

333
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,000
things that i've ever seen like i

334

mentioned there with peter hawk

335
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,240
but he was also [ __ ] and evil and

336
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,200
people

337
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,959
stealing nick you get we've got that

338
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,880
going on in infosec

339
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,639
so i think we have to tolerate that

340
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,639
because that's part of the mix

341
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,720
that makes it so great

342
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,800
but the other one is to remember some of

343
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,399
those people that you're talking to some

344
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,480
of those people that you're encouraging

345
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,800
and they're going to go on and be like

346
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,480
morrison

347
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,160
you know so you're actually walking

348
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,000
along some you know you're actually

349
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,279
mixing now with some people who are

350
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,560
going to be great who are going to be

351
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,240
really influential and you might not

352
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,760
recognize that because i certainly

353
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,800
didn't thought morrissey was a tosser

354
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,240
um but the other one is still there

355
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,360
well the other one is it might be you

356
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,399
yeah so and and it's all about keeping

357
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,560
at it and doing it i didn't i decided i

358
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,399
was going to go and be a cop but i never

359
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,519
did so i was going to be a fraud

360
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,519
investigator and now i've added to that

361
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,839
you know sort of cyber skills but just

362
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,760
remember you know those people out there

363
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,279
and also when you're knocking somebody

364
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,279
down you know somebody told how devoted

365
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,079
he was

366
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,920
his music was crap

367
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,600
the manchester city the manchester scene

368
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,440
would not have happened

369
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,480
you know 100 so i have one question

370
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,240
from a musician

371
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,360
how would you rate max musician skills

372
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,040
he wouldn't know he's never seen me play

373
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,160
i've heard the utah state utah say the

374
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,320
thing is as a musician i have to assure

375
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,200
you

376
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,360
that no matter how skilled anybody is

377
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,020
they're not as good as me

378
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:44,180
[Laughter]

379
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,519
yeah yeah other people you know i might

380
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,199
take some tips from them but that's the

381
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,599
music

382
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,079
absolutely that's all right

383
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,920
well listen pete that's been fascinating

384
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,839
the feedback's been really good about it

385
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,440

386
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,760

387
