community here and involve more and more

50
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,119
people into back bounties

51
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,159
and today i want to tell you more about

52
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,159
uh what the benefit of bug bounty

53
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,720
hunting what the what is it and how it

54
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,560
actually can help your back bouncy

55
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,720
career

56
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,160
so

57
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,480
let's start from the beginning

58
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,040
um probably a lot of us know the problem

59
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,400
that when you are

60
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,720
new in the industry or just a student

61
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,239
it's a problem when they you need to get

62
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,239
experience in order to get job and uh

63
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,239
in order to get experience you need to

64
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,720
get the job and the problem is it's like

65
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,360
a circle and for newcomers it's

66
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,920
definitely difficult to

67
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,760
enter this here

68
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,239
and getting some experience experience

69
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,120
which will count it like a

70
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,840
in your resume before going to any job

71
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,040
so

72
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,760
how how to start that and how backbones

73
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,800
actually

74
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,200
could be helpful here

75
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,360
so all of us

76
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,519
can participate in this world of black

77
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,080
bounties because it's open to anyone

78
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,800
like the student to developers to just

79
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,800
you know fans of crypto which where

80
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,720
we're working actively

81
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,720
and how it can be helpful you can

82
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,159
first of course you can find

83
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,640
vulnerabilities because like bug

84
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,720
bounties are open to everyone you see

85
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,360
this skull you see what's like which

86
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,120
vulnerabilities companies are looking

87
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,799
for and you can actually test your

88
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,599
skills there and it's like legal

89
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,400
so it's first also what you can do and

90
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,120
how bad balance he can be helpful here

91
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,280
is about like writing reports because by

92
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,239
writing reports you understand how these

93
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,400
vulnerability reports and what's needed

94
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,640
for like companies uh is fermented and

95
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,920
for example

96
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,480
while someone found a vulnerability in a

97
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,959
in a program what they do they go with

98
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,720
their like validation steps like

99
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,879
description of the vulnerability they

100
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,080
also determine the severity by cbss and

101
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,680
they also

102
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,519
choose the category of the vulnerability

103
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,480
which is by cwe and like proof of

104
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,799
concept so general it's like description

105
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,840
of the vulnerability and how it could be

106
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,798
prepared in other in the other part

107
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,440
of the uh probable laptop it could be

108
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,358
understandable

109
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,840
also for bank bounties definitely

110
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,280
there's quite a few tools that can help

111
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,560
you to find vulnerabilities to make your

112
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,800
process of getting this vulnerabilities

113
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,560
easier and faster

114
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,880
and definitely test a lot of different

115
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,479
scenarios about looking for

116
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,639
vulnerabilities and working with a lot

117
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,479
of different companies because while

118
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,040
you're back bounty hunter like

119
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,520
thousands of different programs are open

120
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,919
to you and you can interact with a lot

121
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,479
of companies and they actually inviting

122
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,720
hackers to cooperate with them they

123
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,880
asking for their help and that's pretty

124
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,440
cool because you know when you're

125
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,360
knocking the door where no one is

126
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,840
waiting for you it's not good and it's

127
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,560
uh kind of prohibited in back bounties

128
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,639
and in general in security when you are

129
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,240
doing some testing without any

130
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,320
authorization but in black bounty you

131
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,639
have this authorization and you can work

132
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,320
with different companies because they

133
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,639
ask you to do that

134
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,800
so um

135
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,400
what about

136
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,600
black bounty platforms and

137
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,680
how they actually help you

138
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,199
there are quite a few bug bounty

139
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,360
platforms on the market where you can

140
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,440
test your skills and actual background

141
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,360
platforms this kind of mediator that

142
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,720
help helps hackers to communicate with

143
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,960
companies in the proper way because from

144
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,120
both parties there could be some issues

145
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,759
and definitely that's not what you want

146
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,759
when you're just starting it's better to

147
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,600
use some platforms which help you to

148
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,240
communicate and in this communication

149
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,919
you can definitely

150
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,960
find the way how how to do it in the

151
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,599
proper way

152
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,199
so in the back bounties you

153
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,680
work with real issues with real products

154
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,000
with real businesses and it's good to

155
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,160
get experience because a lot of our

156
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,720
hunters for example they mention this

157
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,560
backbone experience just on their

158
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,880
linkedins and their cvs and it's good

159
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,319
because when you see that the person

160
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,000
doing like background is for two three

161
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,880
years

162
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,000
that sounds a lot because definitely

163
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,919
he knows what he do because like

164
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,759
spending two three years for bounties

165
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,199
that's quite a lot

166
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,360
and if you do that properly and you have

167
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,800
like proper uh like ranks hall of fames

168
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,280
like write-ups whatever that's

169
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,160
definitely influence a lot to when you

170
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,720
are looking for a job

171
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,199
and also what is good about bug bounties

172
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,560
and these like just countries

173
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,560
communities that they are creating

174
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,560
common tools that they are sharing for

175
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,680
putting them on github and you can use

176
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,919
a lot of stuff which is already

177
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,919
open sourced and you can use that to

178
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,919
find vulnerabilities

179
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,039
and

180
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,199
definitely what is also cool about bug

181
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,120
bounty community that a lot of people

182
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,360
just sharing what they found there is in

183
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,840
some platform that you have this um kind

184
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,560
of open stream of reports disclosed

185
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,120
reports where you can see all these uh

186
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,039
scenarios that hackers are testing the

187
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,440
tool they are using like some some

188
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,759
specific stuff about testing

189
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,919
so it's kind of open community where you

190
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,479
can get a lot just you just need your

191
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,400
curiosity and willingness actually to do

192
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,639
that

193
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:31,680
um

194
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,720
so

195
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,639
mostly but bounty is about uh

196
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,039
of course except like doing research

197
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,599
like testing new tools and approaches

198
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,759
it's a good playground because you have

199
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,840
like thousands of domain names thousands

200
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,840
of applications where you can test your

201
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,000
new tools and it's illegal

202
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,479
and also you can build different case

203
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,280
studies based on different industries

204
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,479
because you can work with banks airlines

205
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,360
e-commerces crypto exchanges

206
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,599
like some hardware and stuff and it's

207
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,360
pretty cool because you have so many

208
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,120
different experiences and needless to

209
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,039
see them like applications that you can

210
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,319
work with

211
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,000
that's pretty cool because you don't

212
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,360
need to go for like for to work for some

213
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,599
airline actually to be able to test the

214
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,599
application and it's cool because you

215
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,319
can apply your knowledge there in the

216
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,919
back bounty and

217
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,560
and get some profit some knowledge and

218
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,400
experience

219
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,919
um in most cases by our experience

220
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,279
hackers

221
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,399
can train their attention during bug

222
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,559
bounties because

223
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,320
all black bounty programs has pretty

224
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,200
clear scope where they mention which

225
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,600
applications domain names ib addresses

226
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,399
whatever uh company wants to test and

227
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,320
which they

228
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,839
don't want to test

229
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,720
for example there are a lot of cases uh

230
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,640
just because of um

231
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,839
really low

232
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,320
attention level that hikers look

233
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,480
vulnerability is not at the right end

234
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,279
points and report something that's out

235
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,320
of school

236
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,279
because in every policy or we have

237
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,680
in-school vulnerabilities and outscore

238
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,519
vulnerabilities because not for all

239
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,440
vulnerabilities companies are willing to

240
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,000
pay they they are willing to pay for the

241
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,959
um

242
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,560
programs and for like for

243
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,399
vulnerabilities where

244
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,959
they they see the impacts about that and

245
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,200
it that's pretty important because you

246
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,839
can spend a lot of time and then just

247
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,560
because uh of low level of attention you

248
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,959
understand that you test it's not not

249
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,120
that end point and this endpoint is out

250
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,160
of scope

251
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,080
and also it's very important to follow

252
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,160
the program updates because in some

253
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,200
cases by our experience as well when um

254
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,959
when someone found a lot of

255
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,040
vulnerabilities in one endpoint they

256
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,480
usually uh put this uh endpoint out of

257
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,959
slope to be able to fix to fix

258
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,480
everything and then uh put it uh back to

259
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,279
in school so in most cases back bound is

260
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,839
about attention test as well because you

261
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,480
need to follow just rules because when

262
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,160
you're going

263
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,959
side back you can get into trouble

264
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,279
because it's also about legal stuff

265
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,120
because testing something

266
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,760
is you should uh have like

267
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,000
approval for that for example when we do

268
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,560
pen tests we all time we get approval

269
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,040
for doing this intrusion work because

270
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,000
it's it's illegal if you don't have it

271
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,880
and by our statistics uh for the last

272
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,880
four years uh they were found like

273
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,200
around 1000 vulnerabilities

274
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,760
and the average price vulnerability is

275
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,160
around 500

276
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,760
and that's pretty cool because you can

277
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,640
spend like minutes or hours and get to

278
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,920
get this money uh of course if you

279
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,600
if you're experienced enough but in

280
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,440
order to get experience you also can do

281
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,560
that we have a lot of cases when just

282
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,720
newcomers because of their you know

283
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,519
another way of thinking they found

284
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,279
vulnerabilities and get their first

285
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,120
money on back bounty not because they

286
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,360
have like pretty cool technical skills

287
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,360
because bug bounties is also about

288
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,360
testing business logic which is really

289
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,360
important it's about different access

290
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,839
controls about different like just

291
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,920
different access and different workflows

292
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,839
how it works when you're using some

293
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,760
application and see that something is

294
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,480
not going well or something is varied

295
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,880
you probably can test that

296
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,720
and see if the company

297
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,440
has the bug bounty and report it if if

298
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,760
something about security security issues

299
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,800
because um although um you can you can

300
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,800
do the back bounty you know like your

301
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,640
job but sometimes you're just using some

302
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,399
obligations for music for video or

303
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,959
whatever and you see something something

304
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,399
wrong because your

305
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,279
your hacker mind uh tells you that

306
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,040
something something could be wrong here

307
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,279
and i can see what's wrong and test it

308
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,360
but before it's there to check if they

309
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,600
have bug bounty and if they are willing

310
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,880
actually to accept your report

311
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,480
and then another interesting thing that

312
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,399
bug bounties is a part of that but

313
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,240
generally like vulnerability disclosure

314
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,920
industry is is like bigger and you can

315
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,399
not only look for bug bounty but also

316
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,200
for vulnerability disclosure policy for

317
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,600
security text on the websites

318
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,000
uh and trying to see if the company

319
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,360
actually

320
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,440
used some best practices about working

321
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,839
with hackers and being transparent in

322
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,399
this market

323
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,680
um

324
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,800
so what's behind these bounties and

325
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,240
what you actually can get with um

326
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,560
with doing bug bounties

327
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,839
so uh definitely you can

328
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,120
develop

329
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,880
some research tools

330
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,560
which can be used in in other cases i

331
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,399
can tell you a story here one of our

332
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,160
hackers he started like a qe engineer

333
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,279
and

334
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,399
he switched to like more biology

335
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,480
and from that point he was curious about

336
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,320
about security vulnerabilities he

337
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,720
started to work inside that industry uh

338
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,839
in some like um security consulting

339
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,040
company

340
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,160
and started to do but bounty

341
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,160
he'd done i guess like couple of years

342
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,880
he have made like millions

343
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,680
on like mobile vulnerabilities

344
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,680
with his scanner

345
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,639
and

346
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:23,519
he

347
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,920
now he's doing the startup where he uses

348
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,240
this scanner to help other hackers

349
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,639
actually to find vulnerabilities to

350
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,880
report them and to

351
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,920
like to get bounty to get more knowledge

352
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,880
from that and also he uh he's suggesting

353
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,959
his scanner to enterprises

354
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,519
where he found vulnerabilities before

355
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,800
and

356
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,040
yeah trying to help them to automate

357
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,440
make this process more automatic and

358
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,079
yeah security more robust

359
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,680
so a lot of

360
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,279
a lot of guys actually

361
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,880
sometimes lack of motivation to do bug

362
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,240
bounty because um because

363
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,839
you know when you are not funding

364
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,680
vulnerabilities for a long time that's

365
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,839
definitely the motivation but

366
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,399
uh once you've found something cool you

367
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,800
can like you can find more and more like

368
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,079
every time

369
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,560
and also what's cool about that that you

370
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,760
can learn every time so for example a

371
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,000
lot of hackers just do um

372
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,240
mobile or web

373
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,480
back hunting but now in the market there

374
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,639
is more and more like crypto programs

375
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,560
which is smart contracts blockchain

376
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,360
protocols and other stuff and it's where

377
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,680
you can like enhance your knowledge and

378
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,360
go deeper in the this stack of

379
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,920
technologies and understand more because

380
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,399
the competition there is a defense

381
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,320
little lower than anything like

382
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,040
classical backbones but with the web and

383
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,279
the mobile

384
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,480
um and also what we see uh we heard a

385
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,279
lot of stories from our hackers that

386
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,040
they started with bug bounties doing it

387
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,120
like for a couple of years and then they

388
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,079
just

389
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,639
applied to facebook or twitter or like

390
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,279
some huge companies or tik tok and they

391
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,680
work now as they are

392
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,000
application security engineers or even

393
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,560
triage guys which means that

394
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,320
before they they

395
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,040
were on the other side of the screen

396
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,199
submitting this box and now they are

397
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,600
helping company to actually validate all

398
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,240
these vulnerabilities from hackers and

399
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,560
it's pretty cool because definitely this

400
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,720
industry is quite new but still there

401
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,399
are a lot of opportunities and when you

402
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,720
have this relevant experience you can

403
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,920
apply to

404
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,880
companies where they already implemented

405
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,279
approach and by gartner predictions it

406
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,120
would be like more than 50 percent of

407
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,040
enterprises which is going to use

408
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,839
backbone in the coming years so now it's

409
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,240
like around i don't remember but this

410
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,880
like two three percent just just 2

411
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,639
percent when you're starting this

412
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,040
approach with this crowdsourcing

413
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,320
approach to security definitely

414
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,040
in couple of years you can find more and

415
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,639
more job and actually get your first

416
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,959
experience with that because it's just

417
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,399
about your desire to do

418
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,600
um yeah so we just gathered some

419
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,759
some links for developers and for

420
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,000
beginners actually how they switched

421
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,800
how they can switch to security and

422
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,600
where they can try their skills it's

423
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,759
also about the theoretical knowledge and

424
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,320
also some about a vulnerable

425
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,959
lapse way you can try your skills

426
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:33,920
and

427
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,480
yeah i will share this presentation

428
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,720
afterwards to to be able to go through

429
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,759
that

430
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,680
so uh also

431
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,680
we we gathered some information

432
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,720
regarding podcasts where you can listen

433
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,360
and do some challenges and other stuff

434
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,600
where you can go deep into this industry

435
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,519
understand what's going on which

436
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,839
programs which tools which like

437
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,800
educational platforms you can use and uh

438
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,120
yeah just go deeper in the sphere and

439
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,759
understand what's going on

440
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,640
yes this this is about uh tools and labs

441
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,240
where you can actually apply your

442
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,039
knowledge and test it i'm pretty sure

443
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,520
you heard about a lot of them we just

444
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,880
make short conclusion of um

445
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,599
what what we use how our hackers work

446
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,079
what they recommend and uh yeah you're

447
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,760
welcome to test all that stuff

448
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,839
uh yes so

449
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,000
um we're actually developing our

450
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,320
community of hackers and working on

451
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,240
different academies and educational

452
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,600
materials how to involve more engineers

453
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,160
into back hunting and security testing

454
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,559
so you're always welcome to join our

455
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,200
community and also for all

456
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,679
beer lovers we are

457
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,200
doing the network party in lisbon

458
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,840
during the summit so if anyone there

459
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,000
just join us we'll be happy

gone here

465
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,480
really good really interesting hopefully

466
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,200
it's

467
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,960
um got the attention of people that are

468
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,679
interested in the bug bounty environment

469
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,799
and that community so wonderful um have

470
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,880
we got any questions yes yeah we do all

471
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,240
right so the question here from nolly

472
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,520
is

473
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,240
how do you guide young people who rock

474
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,720
up arrive expecting to make

475
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,120
a real big payday

476
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,120
from the start

477
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,919
um so definitely when you are starting

478
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,600
you you should

479
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,840
work more on your reputation on your

480
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,080
statistics work with different programs

481
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,799
and get you know some experience because

482
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,480
everyone is looking for experienced

483
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,120
hackers but definitely for open and

484
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,600
public programs everyone can participate

485
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,400
and get their first hall of fames ranks

486
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,640
and other stuff so

487
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,880
just start and and to look for

488
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,440
vulnerabilities

489
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,160
so yeah i i have a question so how do

490
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,440
you approach

491
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,160
the

492
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,080
bug bounty community from the

493
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,960
perspective of sort of educating them on

494
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,679
what's important you know because

495
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,760
i get hit up every couple of weeks from

496
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,360
so-called

497
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,160
you has bug bounty people um and they're

498
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,160
gonna say something like your website

499
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,600
supports um

500
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,360
insecure cipher suite please pay me 250

501
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,520
us dollars yeah oh missing headers or

502
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,640
some

503
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,559
settings yeah we know that

504
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,880
i get it all the time yeah definitely

505
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,880
it's a problem of the industry i would

506
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,799
say

507
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,960
it's it's more about you know

508
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,240
um educating community in the way we can

509
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,960
do other platforms or other engineers

510
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,039
but if you want to get real results you

511
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,600
definitely won't do that i guess

512
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,919
it doesn't work on the other side of the

513
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,640
screen there is still guys who who knows

514
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,360
what they do and all this

515
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,039
emails doesn't make sense it's just a

516
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,960
waste of time for both parties honestly

517
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,480
in most cases uh by our experience we

518
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,000
received so many of them like 98 i would

519
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,760
say was useless

520
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,159
only like two percent was by emails

521
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,000
because usually they are trying like

522
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,919
missing headers or spfs or something

523
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,720
that they can usually try with scanners

524
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,440
it doesn't work everyone can run a

525
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,840
scanner and the importance of bug bounty

526
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,159
in the hacker brain because that's the

527
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,000
business logic vulnerabilities are the

528
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,159
most interesting when you can go deeper

529
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,240
into in the products and technology

530
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,760
understand how it works and find

531
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,000
something how to bypass it like usually

532
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,679
just use your hack your mind to find the

533
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,400
backdoor not run a scanner like everyone

534
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,559
can run a scanner it's it's not what may

535
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,720
like brings you money

536
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,120
i i have another question and and it's

537
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,320
sort of a bit of a pivot i'm not aware

538
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,799
of any particularly

539
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,799
good scanners for mobile applications

540
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,520
so i'm wondering is that an emerging

541
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,320
space then in the bug bounty community

542
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,240
and if it is how do we reconcile a app

543
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,280
that has vulnerabilities versus the

544
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,480
android or even that other company that

545
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,400
rhymes with apple

546
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,919
um

547
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,080
in terms of like

548
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,640
please yeah yeah yeah okay good

549
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,280
so uh the heart current management uh he

550
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,679
is top one on the google back bounty

551
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,799
program and he has his own scanner which

552
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,159
is mobile application scanner

553
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,840
that's how he found all this

554
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,679
vulnerabilities and now he's moving to

555
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,480
enterprise it's called over secured he

556
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,240
has the like android and i got scanning

557
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,760
and they're like a lot of top

558
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,840
enterprises who works with him

559
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,360
cool so i guess the follow-up to that is

560
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,360
is i wanted to differentiate between

561
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,720
finding a bug bounty in a app

562
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,000
versus finding a vulnerability in an

563
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
underlying operating system i mean

564
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,840
clearly you do both

565
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,600
but i guess what is the ones that are

566
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,960
paying out more is it an app that is you

567
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,600
know 300 000 installations or is it um

568
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,760
a operating system level

569
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,760
vulnerability definitely different

570
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,840
spheres and different specialists and

571
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,760
skills that you need

572
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,760
and suppose both fears are good

573
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,799
interesting but of course more is where

574
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,200
more like harm for the users and the

575
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,240
like level of enterprise and other stuff

576
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,320
because like for zero days they can like

577
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,280
pay millions and the other interesting

578
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,679
stuff that's millions of course in this

579
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:52,480
top

580
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,360
giants but in in crypto now that's

581
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,120
that's insane because for finding

582
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,760
vulnerabilities my contract it can give

583
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,400
you millions just recent like last week

584
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,080
it was like 10 million or something but

585
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,559
bounty for smart contract vulnerability

586
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,559
because in this smart contract they they

587
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,120
hold like a lot of money billions and of

588
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,559
course they they are willing to pay for

589
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,799
vulnerabilities because in other way

590
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,159
they just lose money in their users

591
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,080
but it's you know it's pretty specific

592
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,240
sphere you should have specific

593
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,400
knowledge but it's really emerging there

594
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,039
is so many companies and so few hackers

595
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,200
who can do that

596
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,280
so it's really good one of the things

597
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,159
where to invest your time and

598
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,120
knowledge right now

599
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,240
scott

600
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,600
i wasn't going to speak but it looks as

601
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,279
if we're all super excited to ask you

602
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,279
loads of questions yeah mike

603
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,240
yeah

604
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,840
sean

605
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,880
thank you

606
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,159
thank you mark um so i have a question

607
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,320
doing bug bounties can be really

608
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,080
frustrating i imagine um especially for

609
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,520
those beginning now if they're not going

610
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,720
to find something and how do you or what

611
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,799
sort of advice do you

612
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,320
want to give out in terms of trying to

613
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,120
get people staying motivated so they can

614
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,880
just keep at it and hopefully find

615
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,880
something that pays off eventually yeah

616
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,960
definitely there is like a really

617
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,039
frustrating when you can't find like

618
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,679
something for some time

619
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,520
but it's also you know it's uh work on

620
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,400
like each person and uh what we do we're

621
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,559
trying to you know motivate to find more

622
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,880
vulnerabilities and you know hub hacker

623
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,039
is doing some educational stuff

624
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,400
doing some like joint hacking um

625
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,919
into different programs so

626
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,919
it's it's okay you should just accept it

627
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,520
you can't find vulnerabilities all the

628
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,279
time because probably it's it's not

629
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,279
about you it's about just very good

630
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,600
security of this application or because

631
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,360
like southern hackers already checked

632
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,440
that of course this security level is

633
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,039
higher

634
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,279
just uh switch a program switch

635
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,919
attention just go relax i know doing

636
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,840
something and then go back to that and

637
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,279
do what you love

638
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,720
cool great

639
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,039
and my question was

640
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,600
my observation i think and question

641
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,240
is one of the things i really love about

642
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,120
bug bounties and the bug bounty programs

643
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,480
is this idea that it incentivizes

644
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,840
hackers

645
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,000
in a positive way

646
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,400
so rather than them become criminal

647
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,799
and hack and hold companies are ransom

648
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,799
and all that kind of stuff

649
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,840
they hack through ethical channels using

650
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,679
recognized platforms or just directly

651
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,919
with the organization um

652
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,679
but not missing headers

653
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,440
and

654
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,919
but the idea is that it moves people

655
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,760
away from a criminal

656
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,919
direction and into a completely

657
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,120
legitimate direction so in your

658
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,600
experience are you seeing that being the

659
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,080
driver and the and the motivator for

660
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,880
people to do it the honest way

661
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,360
yes definitely especially encrypt

662
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,679
because you can steal a lot of money but

663
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,919
the problem is you can't withdraw them

664
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,240
easily and you should go through bug

665
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,640
bounties you have no other way because

666
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,039
if you hack some money and it would be

667
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,440
blocked on all exchanges and another

668
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,520
stuff of course you can find some ways

669
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,159
but it it won't get you you know legal

670
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,880
money uh you will be definitely tracked

671
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,240
and uh

672
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,000
you never know what's happened after

673
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,640
that so definitely we see positive

674
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,720
change because while the companies are

675
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,760
adopting back bounties more hikers and

676
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,159
more just engineers see that and can

677
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,240
legally participate because they're just

678
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,600
using some application and found

679
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,960
vulnerabilities what they should do with

680
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,039
that of course they can just leave it

681
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,679
and don't do

682
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:43,679
like anything with that

683
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:44,720
but

684
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,400
if you can get money of it and it's

685
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,640
legal and you see the the company is

686
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,000
actually open to receive vulnerabilities

687
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,919
why not to do that in the legal way and

688
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,520
definitely like bouncy started um like

689
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,840
around eight years ago and definitely

690
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,000
like positive change into this ethical

691
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,360
way of hacking

692
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,279
and working with hackers because for a

693
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,360
lot of people hackers you know we just

694
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,880
you know someone in black hoodies and

695
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,960
really criminals and very dangerous

696
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,279
person but in fact it's not just curious

697
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,400
programmers curious guys who wants to

698
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,360
help but probably help themselves not

699
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,720
the company

700
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,799
because there is no legal ways how to

701
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,960
help these companies and this this

702
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,200
problem is definitely um evolving and

703
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,320
yeah more companies trying to do that

704
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,559
