1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,560
excellent thank you and i'm hoping you

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,240
can hear me assume if you can't uh

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,560
you'll be yelling at me very shortly so

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,559
uh thank you all um first a uh a content

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,960
warning um devsecops

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,639
cybersecurity

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,239
if you're still here i'm happy i

8
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,080
personally hate those terms but the

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,680
business uses them all the time they

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,279
know what i do i'm sure i'm going to

11
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,400
mention them

12
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,480
so this talk is aimed at a few audiences

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,760
it's aimed at the people who sort of

14
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,880
build things who break things fix things

15
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,400
um but it's also people who build

16
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,880
processes and influence people and uh

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,399
for people who just care about actually

18
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,640
getting security right you know in our

19
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,160
new world

20
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,239
and so i'm gonna be building on a lot of

21
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,000
other people's work today uh it is not

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,760
one thing anyone can do in the blue team

23
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,360
to fix things and there's been a whole

24
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,800
lot of work that a lot of people have

25
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,640
gone in to sort of fix these things that

26
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,039
we do over time um content's largely

27
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,640
non-technical because my goal here is to

28
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,239
change how we do security not

29
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,079
necessarily what we're doing um so i'm

30
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,440
going to give some tips and the reason

31
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,960
why i'm doing this is because frankly i

32
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,879
think we're falling behind

33
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:03,840
uh

34
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,000
as product as the digital as development

35
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,240
as cloud continues to move a pace

36
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,320
we're doing things that simply just

37
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,960
don't work as well anymore

38
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,600
uh so um here's some guidance for that

39
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,840
excellent but first thing i have to do

40
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,520
is i have to set the scene

41
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,000
this is probably the origin of the quote

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,439
there's only two types of companies

43
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,799
those that know they've been compromised

44
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,880
and those that don't know it's a lot of

45
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,119
different attribution around that um so

46
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,119
you have people from cisco saying

47
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,880
they've said it first you have this dude

48
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,759
you have others but really the point is

49
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,680
this quote is

50
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,400
sort of how we live now

51
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,320
these are words that we read in the

52
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,360
industry assume reach insider threat

53
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,360
inevitable compromise

54
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,320
this is all very true but it sort of

55
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,880
leads to a certain way of thinking

56
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,040
um it's informed how we do security and

57
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,079
over the last few years it's really had

58
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,759
an impact on what we do day-to-day and i

59
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,200
would like you to keep that in mind as i

60
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,000
continue to talk

61
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,199
so the other bit of context you want for

62
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,440
setting the scene is that security is

63
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,680
still a maturing discipline um there's a

64
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,280
lot of different formative factors that

65
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,879
we've had uh that have

66
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:17,840
these are things that have actually

67
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,599
really helped us get where we are i mean

68
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,280
we're an industry of out of the box

69
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,319
thinkers where auto attacks uh we

70
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,760
as many people have talked about

71
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,160
including uh mark uh large cardinal on

72
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,280
twitter there is no real baseline for

73
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,200
what a security analyst or even a

74
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,879
security engineer or a security

75
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,160
architect architecture anyone does it's

76
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,599
all made up by the person who writes the

77
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,000
job spec and we know how good those are

78
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,840
we're full of rock star attitudes and i

79
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,599
can still think of the first time i went

80
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,959
to dc 4420 in london and 80 percent of

81
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,720
the

82
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,920
people in the room and there's probably

83
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,239
a good 60 70 people in the room said

84
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,239
they were just a pen tester

85
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,400
i'm sure about half of them were uh yeah

86
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,239
and so and yet it's still hard to hire

87
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,319
for so yeah yeah security is really

88
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,760
something that is the business still

89
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,400
trying to get a handle on

90
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,000
and this is really sort of how we fall

91
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,159
into things um we've come to see some

92
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,920
common patterns no matter what vertical

93
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,599
we're in we got some red team people we

94
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,280
break things got some blue team people

95
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,959
we yell at people who are doing things

96
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,720
right and we try to fix the things that

97
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,959
happen when damage gets in

98
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,720
and in theory the blue team does a lot

99
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,120
more stuff around policy does a lot more

100
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,680
stuff around outreach and protection

101
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,599
but in practice this is where a lot of

102
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,080
us fall

103
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,519
as security teams we defend

104
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,640
we tell it to do better and it generally

105
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,280
doesn't happen

106
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,040
we don't usually have that one space in

107
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,040
our lives and in our teams for the

108
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,360
builders uh and these these cards by the

109
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,879
way they're definitely not mine these

110
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,400
are from april right these are from

111
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,480
lewis come on uh there's links at the

112
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,239
bottom of this this is a whole separate

113
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,760
talking of itself around the color wheel

114
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,959
that i'm not going to talk to you right

115
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,840
here but the point is in our teams the

116
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,439
yellow team the software builders the

117
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,519
application developers the architects

118
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,360
they very often aren't on our games they

119
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,959
very often go and build the stuff on the

120
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,599
left hand side of the slide

121
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,959
and

122
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,400
really what you're seeing here the

123
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,560
yellow team along with a whole bunch of

124
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,480
other people they go to the left of the

125
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,798
slide over the years all the red and

126
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,238
blue teamers we form up here on the

127
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,519
right and we defend or attach ourselves

128
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,479
to the stuff on the left

129
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,880
so what that means is that the stuff on

130
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,120
the left is how we determine what we had

131
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,960
to do on the right

132
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,440
industrial plans data centers e-commerce

133
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,600
sites brick and mortar users cyber

134
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,759
security as an organization has been

135
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,280
built around that we're doing this on

136
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,280
the fly after all and despite

137
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,120
an inconsistent starting base for our

138
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,199
own teams the business was forming some

139
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,199
pretty common patterns so what we have

140
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,960
on the right we have security checks we

141
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,040
have pen testers we have people writing

142
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,360
policy we probably have a really really

143
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,199
really busy sock you got some

144
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,520
engineering and architecture outreach um

145
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,280
and you have a lot of different both

146
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,520
legitimate asks from your end users and

147
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,280
threats from attackers and use and all

148
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,080
that

149
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,960
um

150
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,400
and a lot of those people in the

151
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,840
business over here on the left really

152
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,919
made our lives hard over the last two

153
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,400
decades um and and i do mean that this

154
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,080
model hasn't really changed much and

155
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,360
over the last two decades gotten a

156
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,440
little bit bigger

157
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,360
so

158
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,199
this sort of worked

159
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,199
no one really did prioritize security

160
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,039
enough we all know that if we've spent

161
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,960
any time in the field lately

162
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,960
but things would usually get caught by

163
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,000
the sock

164
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,639
sometimes incidents would be detected

165
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,080
eventually

166
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,080
depending on your maturity depending on

167
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,000
the size of your org and depending upon

168
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,680
whether or not you have a security team

169
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,880
and whether or not you have the breach

170
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,880
recently enough to have funding because

171
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,240
that's the pattern that we've all joked

172
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,840
about for years isn't it until there's a

173
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,160
breach you don't really get funding

174
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,280
um so

175
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,360
um until this security doesn't get

176
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,280
enough resource to do its job and this

177
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,840
is because really there's a fundamental

178
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,039
disconnect

179
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,199
between security policy and business

180
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,240
incentive

181
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,720
the way it works is that shinier

182
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,319
shinier work with budget wins

183
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,560
so obviously what we did for the last 20

184
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,039
years is we fixed this right now

185
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,479
this would be the de facto business

186
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,160
approach to planning and doing a

187
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,960
security for the last two decades you

188
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,639
set up a team you give them both budget

189
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,039
you don't connect them policy wise and

190
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,639
then security yells and gets funding

191
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,319
when things finally fall apart and you

192
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,199
repeat that cycle

193
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,080
either way that sort of got us along

194
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,720
um time has passed things have started

195
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,280
changing security is more of a problem

196
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,199
ransomware is more of a problem but

197
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,520
security is starting to become

198
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,199
recognized by the business a lot more

199
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,639
people are starting to say i need or i

200
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,800
want to do security not that they know

201
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,199
what it is but they want to do it

202
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,599
and so the theme uh since this time in

203
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,520
the modern era has become more

204
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,639
more breaches

205
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,560
more events

206
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,440
more socks more specialisms more teams

207
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,880
more ransomware

208
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,080
more ransomware and more rounds

209
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,759
somewhere did i sit around somewhere

210
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,520
all of these issues have started to add

211
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,280
up um we are seeing a lot of security

212
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,039
events in the news we all know that

213
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,039
people are starting to care about this

214
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,199
and the business is starting to try to

215
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,800
figure out how to do security better

216
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,199
silicon valley knows that

217
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,599
we've continued to ignore the systemic

218
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,400
factors to do security right for decades

219
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,720
because silicon valley and marketing and

220
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,160
budgets were all there to tell us if

221
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,520
they had silver bullets to fix us we

222
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,560
know this

223
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,280
um cloud security tooling has

224
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,840
massively entered our industry now cloud

225
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,520
security tooling is a stagnant market

226
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,039
because every single innovative product

227
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,720
gets snapped up by a large corporate

228
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,080
trying to enhance their portfolio and uh

229
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,919
all of this is really confusing the

230
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,000
space we operate in um so yeah we're in

231
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,680
a modern era lots of reaches lots of

232
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,680
shiny tools lots of marketing and we're

233
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,039
in a bubble and the defender doesn't

234
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,199
know what to do and when to do it

235
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,520
uh so yeah the security team they had to

236
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,039
respond to this and what did they do

237
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,319
well let's see security first

238
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,400
on the right here they expanded uh the

239
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,280
blue but the blue hexes are additional

240
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,720
sort of teams and disciplines we've

241
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,800
matured over the last two decades the

242
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,879
green ones are sort of the enhanced set

243
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,879
ups and red team and attention focus we

244
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,120
have and of course we've got a bit more

245
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,479
advanced of the criminal environment

246
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,800
here on this slide too so yeah what we

247
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,800
did is we centralized our tools and our

248
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,360
processes we standardized them

249
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,799
our threat landscape has massively

250
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,320
increased and the information we got so

251
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,760
we industrialized and i think anyone

252
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,360
who's working a sock knows that really

253
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,440
that's the focus now industrializing

254
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,679
scale automation figuring out how we can

255
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,480
do more with less time and limited

256
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,040
information uh

257
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,640
why do we do this well because the

258
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,480
legacy enterprise i think on the left is

259
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,720
so full effect that an obsolete security

260
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,640
that reaches inevitable so we focus

261
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,320
there but

262
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,760
let's step back because that wasn't

263
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,760
necessarily the wrong thing to do but it

264
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,240
does change things slightly uh and

265
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,200
really

266
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,959
the thing is is that while we got bigger

267
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,880
as a security team our model didn't

268
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,480
change

269
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,440
but the application wall did

270
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,240
it got complex we got cloud and cloud

271
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,399
enabled new models and new ways of doing

272
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,279
things

273
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,600
remember the biggest reason why we did

274
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,440
things the way we do is because the

275
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,200
business operated the same way and the

276
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,640
cloud has shifted how the business

277
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,760
operates

278
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,959
startups

279
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,720
may go all cloud with a little bit of

280
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,640
on-prem and random laptops that we bring

281
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,800
in small businesses and the eternal land

282
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,600
of hybrid enterprises with shadow clouds

283
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,880
and of course people who actually do

284
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,279
cloud native right um

285
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,880
these are all different security

286
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,519
topologies these are different ways to

287
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,360
give advice to the business and require

288
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,120
different ways that security operates

289
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,720
and while we are still figuring that out

290
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,720
it multiplied because it's very easy to

291
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,200
build more clouds

292
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,360
so suddenly you might have several dozen

293
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,760
shadow clouds across a horrifying breath

294
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,160
of maturity because business can change

295
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,640
frighteningly fast

296
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,519
so

297
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,200
yeah all of these people they want

298
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,959
security to give advice and security

299
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,959
doesn't have time to them

300
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,440
so you've gone from zero to dozens of

301
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,279
cloud instances to organizations of um

302
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,680
sas services or some variant of above

303
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,399
and

304
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,160
it's almost bewildering how quick it's

305
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,760
happening to a lot of security games and

306
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,279
john cutler's quote on the right here

307
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,839
really says it all um a digital product

308
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:30,640
team

309
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,560
and we say product here this product is

310
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,399
a great example but a digital team can

311
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,480
build things for a business product for

312
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,360
e-commerce for operations i mean i've

313
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,040
done my time in heavy industry and it's

314
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,279
just as viable to uh being uh

315
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,200
what's the word

316
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
it's a it's a plight word for hack but

317
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,760
they are um revolutionized by the cloud

318
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,079
that's the right word uh but point is is

319
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,920
these teams can do everything all in one

320
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,519
there's no blockers or no other

321
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,320
enterprise bits that make it slow down

322
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,200
so

323
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,880
with all of that going on where does

324
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,279
that leave security

325
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,800
like i said we haven't really changed

326
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,880
much it's 2021 people care about

327
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,560
security now

328
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,519
right they care about security now but

329
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,800
they don't necessarily know what it is

330
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,360
so they all come to us and um that's

331
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,279
lots of questions we're getting asked we

332
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,880
have devsecops teams they do something

333
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,399
because no

334
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,519
they do

335
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,760
anyone

336
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,920
they're just another team who try to

337
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,519
influence the business so often when i

338
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,760
see them they often are using the same

339
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,399
self-serve model that information

340
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,959
security teams have been using day in

341
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,000
day out

342
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,800
uh

343
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,839
and so if they're just sort of doing the

344
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,120
same thing as other teams with the new

345
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,800
name have we just made the role

346
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,199
description problem worse yes we have

347
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,639
this is a hammer

348
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,720
remember what i was saying earlier about

349
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,000
our uh assumed breach mentality

350
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,839
now it's valid

351
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,279
what we've just been talking about most

352
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,480
networks large and small and this

353
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,399
includes cloud networks they're held

354
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,160
together by so much sticking plaster and

355
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,399
tech debt that it's worth investing into

356
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,320
detection and response and let's see

357
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,519
let's make sure i'm not being too

358
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,320
controversial here

359
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,959
it's always worth investing into

360
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,440
detection and response uh prevention is

361
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,720
absolutely not a panacea

362
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,519
but the thing is is that

363
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,839
humans take shortcuts when you only have

364
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,000
a hammer everything is a nail

365
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,480
and in enterprise security we have a lot

366
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,560
of hammocks

367
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,800
in geek out in words for a second

368
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,800
uh that particular phrase is called the

369
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,680
law of the instrument it's probably

370
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,600
at least a century older than the two

371
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,920
abrahams maslow and kaplan who are

372
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,480
usually quoted with saying it um it's

373
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,480
also attributed to people making fun of

374
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,279
birmingham um

375
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,480
and it's just about humanity's

376
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,320
habit of using the tool that comes to

377
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,399
hand and in information technology it's

378
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,839
called the golden hammer uh as

379
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:06,399
literature

380
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,279
a programming practice to be avoided

381
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,360
relevant in the 21st century and is

382
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,720
highly applicable to software

383
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,880
development many times software

384
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,760
developers this person has observed tend

385
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,240
to use the same tools to do a completely

386
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,839
new different project with new

387
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,279
constraints

388
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,959
in other words in technology we have a

389
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,120
habit of applying a comfortable problem

390
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,200
approach to a new problem

391
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,320
and we're doing it right now in

392
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,160
enterprise center hopefully you're not

393
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,519
getting tired of me saying that because

394
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,920
i had probably have another 15 minutes

395
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,800
of me saying that

396
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,959
so really we've gone from a fundamental

397
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,800
disconnect and policy between security

398
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,959
and medicines to

399
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,040
a fundamental disconnect in policy in

400
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,120
practice so we've just gotten worse

401
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,880
because now our environments don't even

402
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,480
match our tools

403
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,920
uh and as a security team if you're

404
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,279
lucky

405
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,600
what that results in is your traditional

406
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,519
on-premise problem magnified by the

407
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,600
number of clouds you have that's not a

408
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,199
great situation to be in but that's a

409
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:08,720
lucky situation

410
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,880
um if you're unlucky then you end up

411
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,920
with bigger mismatches um

412
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,000
things that aren't desired things that

413
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,079
you don't want or things that you want

414
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,000
they don't get budgeted controls that

415
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,240
you try to get put in get de-prioritized

416
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,639
as these gaps sort of widen

417
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,160
patches get missed when engineers are

418
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,480
reassigned all these sort of gaps that

419
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,399
wonder when you're wondering why these

420
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,639
three controls are operating in reality

421
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,120
so

422
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,360
the reason for that is the more cloud

423
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,519
native and more mature your dev product

424
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,279
engineer sre

425
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,320
whatever you want to call them team is

426
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,279
the more likely you have a number of

427
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,000
discrete independent environments or

428
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,199
tool sets or concerns or things that

429
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,600
have different security topologies and

430
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,760
different models different ways of doing

431
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,120
things and different things you may or

432
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,040
may not want to look at

433
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,360
and our model enterprise security it

434
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,120
doesn't scale when the tool sets

435
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,120
multiply the support demand on the

436
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,040
security team increases with every piece

437
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,519
of new tech and policy ask these all of

438
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,680
these new platforms they don't get

439
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,320
properly onboarded um and what do we do

440
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,320
we simplify more one tool set to rule

441
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,360
them all

442
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,079
maintain stock viability at the cost of

443
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,240
advising the business of our core thing

444
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,079
and focus on incident response and

445
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,160
centralized control

446
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,279
that is

447
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,199
the mantra of them of many modern

448
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,519
security games in face of the ever

449
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,519
increasing uh

450
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,399
cloud ask

451
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,839
why really please ignore the rubbish

452
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:46,639
words

453
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,279
i love them because this four tiered

454
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,800
structure makes sense it's from the

455
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,040
cloud security alliance i have never

456
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,720
come up with the term apple structure

457
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,480
myself and if i could come up with a

458
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,399
better term than they did i would use it

459
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,800
but yeah let's take a look at why

460
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,880
what happened in the cloud is for

461
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,279
is something very important happening uh

462
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,639
our traditional three-tier

463
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,800
infrastructure application data model

464
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,720
became a four-tier model a cloud

465
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,320
management barrier was introduced that's

466
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,759
what's called the meta structure on this

467
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,920
page and that cloud management area has

468
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,839
changed where security decisions get

469
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:18,639
made

470
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,800
it's not that devsecops is an early

471
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,959
buzzword that we try to do

472
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,560
devsecops is something that is going to

473
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,160
get done in your cloud whether or not

474
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,279
enterprise security is involved or not

475
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,440
because the decisions are made when the

476
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,920
cloud is built and it's frighteningly

477
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,279
easy to do cloud security wrong not just

478
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,720
for the engineers who are getting

479
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,040
security advice but for security people

480
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,720
who don't understand that the topology

481
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,240
they're advising on is different and

482
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,600
that's the risk of us getting left

483
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,920
behind not for service but incorrect

484
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,360
service

485
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,120
so

486
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,199
all that said it's actually a good thing

487
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:54,399
because

488
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,160
new topologies and new environments

489
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,199
allow

490
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,360
some old tourisms or industry to

491
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,279
actually be true again

492
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,400
for example this one

493
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,319
this we've said it a lot security is

494
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,039
everyone's responsibility but cloud

495
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,720
actually makes it true people in the

496
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,319
front line are making as many or more

497
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,160
decisions as we are in the map

498
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,839
now we have to share that responsibility

499
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,439
with them and take responsibility for

500
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,559
how we support their decisions

501
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,160
this is the democratization of cloud

502
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,439
security

503
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,359
cloud centralized security processes

504
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,039
like ours are just not made for the

505
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,440
scale controller context that we need to

506
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,480
give

507
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,160
some of are classes too don't get me

508
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,440
wrong and i'm sure there's people in the

509
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,520
audience right now who are naysaying me

510
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,400
uh

511
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,880
we have automated scanning tools sas das

512
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,720
sca i asked

513
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,960
structures code scanning a few cloud

514
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,640
security posture management tools are

515
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,880
even draft capable um fortunately i

516
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,000
haven't had a chance to play with them

517
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,200
too much love to uh these tools abound

518
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,559
and there's plenty of sales people who

519
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:53,760
are willing to tell you how this will

520
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,280
give you perfect visibility of the

521
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,600
environment that you don't understand

522
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,640
you see the problem there it masks the

523
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,640
problems all these tools all this

524
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,320
ability to see a master problem that

525
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,280
central policy isn't useful

526
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,080
centralized control doesn't scale

527
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,000
ivory tower teams like enterprise

528
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,400
security don't play nice with product

529
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,799
teams here at the front line

530
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,360
and when questions go unanswered they

531
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,200
cease to be asked when teams find work

532
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,679
results

533
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,080
so the impacts have

534
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,600
engineering teams

535
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,919
confronted by inappropriate or

536
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,840
inapplicable advice

537
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,679
buggy security tooling

538
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,799
brutal administrative processes

539
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,520
they don't make bad decisions they care

540
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,559
but they start doing things themselves

541
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,039
because it's not just easier but often

542
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,360
smoother and possibly more secure than

543
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,880
getting consistent advice from a

544
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,400
security team

545
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,320
and given that most enterprise security

546
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,840
teams due to resource constraints

547
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,240
operate on a self-serve model for advice

548
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,919
this just means that the security team

549
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,320
themselves lose visibility of what the

550
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,120
business is doing

551
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,960
these gaps can be brutal for the

552
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,960
security in the business you get shadow

553
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,600
rt you get major availability issues

554
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,000
unknown control gaps

555
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,320
um i mean hell product making security

556
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,679
decisions is actually huge um so yeah

557
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,000
you get a whole bunch attacked out of it

558
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,080
and it ain't great

559
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,240
if we don't step up to the plate that we

560
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,520
need we're going nowhere and we're going

561
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,120
to play whack-a-mole on our socks the

562
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,559
entire way and think we're doing the

563
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,559
right thing until we're left behind in

564
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,760
the middle of a desert somewhere

565
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,280
now there's a lot we can do about this

566
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,960
and so i'm now in the last photo of the

567
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,320
talk i seem to be doing well now i'm

568
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,760
going to talk about how we can do stuff

569
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,520
about this and hopefully what i'm going

570
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,760
to do here is talk about how our role is

571
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,320
evolving

572
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,720
uh in this next section i'm going to

573
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,400
give you four changes in practice that

574
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,480
we can implement in our teams

575
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,960
the goal here is to create a cultural

576
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,320
shift

577
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,080
it's not going to be easy we're going to

578
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,320
need to burn down anti-patterns we're

579
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,200
going to need to structure

580
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,760
our teams to respond to the business or

581
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,520
at least think about ways we can enable

582
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,000
the business to interact with us

583
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,640
in a scalable fashion and that last is

584
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,240
the key so i'm going to talk about a

585
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,000
very very high-level couple of models

586
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,520
that could possibly handle that at the

587
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,159
end of this um but just your mileage may

588
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,760
vary this is working your teams will be

589
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,440
different than ours so let's get on to

590
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,919
those practices

591
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,000
yeah first one prevention

592
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,840
it is still possible it is still worth

593
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,400
enabling

594
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,320
it's not to say that prevention as a

595
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,159
parasite never has been detection

596
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,559
response are still king but we have been

597
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,640
so focused on assumed reach that we

598
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,720
haven't very often realized that most

599
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,960
cloud deployments are greenfield you can

600
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,880
tool for detection and response just as

601
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,400
well as you can tool for prevention if

602
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,400
you engage early and if you engage early

603
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,960
the sky is the limit engineer your

604
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,880
administrative model for your cloud to

605
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,559
reduce your attack service and reduce

606
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,240
your dependencies on your ongoing debt

607
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,280
debt

608
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,880
engineer your change processes to

609
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,960
minimize your control drift manage your

610
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,200
cloud im so that you're reducing your

611
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,159
attack surface and uh please please use

612
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,120
cloud native tools

613
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,120
we need to change our texture and

614
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,640
tooling practices to do this not just

615
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,880
prevention but we need to understand the

616
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,720
cattle versus pet slide here and yes i

617
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,039
put a slide into a slide because it's

618
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,760
2012 slides can be meta now so yeah in

619
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,720
2012 the cat's versus pedal cats versus

620
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,559
pedal great

621
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,039
the cattle vs pets

622
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,200
model came out for devops i'm not going

623
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,720
to go into too much detail it's here in

624
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,640
case you want to look at it but we have

625
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,640
to adopt that in security

626
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,720
tools are now cattle especially when it

627
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,880
comes into cloud

628
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,960
we have to be willing to give of them

629
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,600
away and accept the results from local

630
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,919
tooling from cloud natives cloud native

631
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,200
sources and things that can really

632
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,480
understand the environments that they're

633
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,159
feeding from instead of relying on one

634
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,480
central tool we need to enable

635
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,600
contact-rich context-rich policy that is

636
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,520
policy that isn't generic for an entire

637
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,600
org but is relevant to the threat

638
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,760
landscape of the cloud environment or

639
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,600
product environment that's that we're

640
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,159
operating in if our devops are advanced

641
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,400
we need to look at ci cd pipelines we

642
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,320
need to look at how we're handling

643
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,320
assets how we're handling artifactory's

644
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,159
repositories and things like this we

645
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,919
have to understand whether and where

646
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,360
we're applying principles such as

647
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,080
immutability immutability or f morality

648
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,600
and so on that's one of the models that

649
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,520
i'm listening on the left here and this

650
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,080
is a fundamental change so even before

651
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,760
we do that with the tech

652
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,159
we have to assess our control objectives

653
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,080
the ones that we've been leaning on for

654
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,120
25 years on the on-prem environment and

655
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,039
figure out if given that the foundation

656
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,960
has changed figure out if our control

657
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,880
implementations are going to be

658
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,559
effective and necessary as we are in the

659
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,559
cloud first we have to check those and

660
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,159
then we have to push them to the cloud

661
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,159
then business-wise so that was the tech

662
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,520
and architecture

663
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,240
business-wise we need to start sharing

664
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,960
responsibility we need to start

665
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,720
treating the business like a fighter we

666
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,600
need to change our nebulous control

667
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,440
objectives into a shared responsibility

668
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,720
framework that the business and

669
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,720
stakeholders have agreed to and they can

670
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,720
build to then we engage those

671
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,320
engineering stakeholders because frankly

672
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,840
an engaged engineering staffer will

673
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,520
probably build your security tool before

674
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,120
it's done

675
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,960
and finally we need to plan for our

676
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,120
impact on the business teams

677
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,600
i have seen edr deployments that can be

678
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,320
forecast to over

679
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,679
i'd say

680
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,120
150 increase the operating costs of

681
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,520
container environments because of odd

682
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,280
resource allocations that needed to be

683
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,440
fixed i've seen cases where security

684
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,760
teams have yelled at product teams

685
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,520
because the security teams necessarily

686
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,120
needed to be patched

687
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,799
i've seen all sorts of things and

688
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,640
engineers care about trust they care

689
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,760
about getting it right they don't like

690
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,120
being yelled at for really selling

691
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,760
things so please don't break your trust

692
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,080
if you impact engineers talk to them and

693
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,520
work with them because now that

694
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,840
engineers care about security

695
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,360
they're going to try to do it right but

696
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,720
they're not going to like being talked

697
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,039
down to so let's go for participative

698
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,559
engagement

699
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,399
and that way we won't bottleneck them

700
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,640
ah yes um

701
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,360
uh and finally uh

702
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,120
encourage cross-functional skills in

703
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,799
your teams and i don't mean go build a

704
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,799
green team or an orange team or a purple

705
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,240
team we've all heard those terms those

706
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,279
are just ways of crossing skills between

707
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,120
red blue yellow and white and all these

708
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,640
other things on here again i happen to

709
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,799
love this color wheel uh but we need

710
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,480
more builders we need more consultants

711
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,760
we need more project managers in our

712
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,000
team and more engineers um we need our

713
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,760
roles to be cross-functional so if i'm

714
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,600
talking to someone in the soft they've

715
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,520
actually done a bit of time engineering

716
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,799
or building they know what it's like to

717
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,559
have to operate something we need to

718
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,200
support when a business function builds

719
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,520
an embedded security function and these

720
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,799
are some thoughts and what that might

721
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,039
look like mario's great he talks a lot

722
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,480
more about this this is one of his

723
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,159
slides in the lower left

724
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,919
and i've linked to both the book he

725
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,000
sourced it from and his talks he's

726
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,440
actually talking a bit about risk and

727
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,840
this stuff next week i think

728
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,159
but the point is uh what you see here on

729
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,320
the left is you see a security

730
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,320
engineering or appsec team that crosses

731
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,799
streams from business to platform to

732
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,640
information risk so that context is

733
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,480
shared and when audit comes along they

734
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,400
have an idea of what's going on

735
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,000
now i don't know about you but every

736
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,840
auditor i knew got their instructions at

737
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,799
the beginning and went from that so if

738
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:31,679
we

739
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,600
don't tell the auditors from the cso's

740
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,799
office to do that they're not going to

741
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,279
listen so yeah we have to plan for this

742
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,000
engage with your business

743
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,480
so i promised a model on how to do this

744
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,600
uh and i'm

745
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,440
in my last four or so minutes so i'm

746
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,440
going to run through this really quick

747
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,720
what can you do when you have

748
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,320
multiplying cloud environments and not

749
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,240
enough assurance here's a template for

750
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,240
thought if you only have central cyber

751
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,000
security you can't do that much you can

752
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,520
do the things in the upper left try to

753
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,679
hire some more builders develop some

754
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,000
policies are essential to your thing but

755
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,520
really what you see happening in the

756
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,600
business is with cloud well

757
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,000
cloud empowers teams and digital product

758
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,360
teams and other teams who use cloud have

759
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,880
figured out this and they start to build

760
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,559
on their own cloud centers of excellence

761
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:13,919
this isn't something that we're

762
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,360
expecting security to do it's just

763
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,000
something that happens and cloud centers

764
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,240
of excellence are something that you can

765
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,159
leverage they can implement

766
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,480
organizational controls across the cloud

767
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,400
you can uh try to ensure there's

768
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,159
standardized tools and patterns that

769
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,640
make it harder for people to mess up

770
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,480
they can offer network visibility and it

771
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,400
all depends on what types of cloud you

772
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,320
have but engaging with them is

773
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,320
extraordinarily useful and you can

774
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,000
federate your devseprops team that's

775
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,600
that little green bubble on the other

776
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,960
right here you can federate your dev

777
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,320
setups team

778
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,960
into uh into those environments and

779
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,720
possibly i mean often they'll be funding

780
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,559
half of them so work with them and

781
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,559
actually build your controls into teams

782
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,480
who don't necessarily report to

783
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,200
enterprise security

784
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,159
and finally uh when you get to a

785
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:01,919
when you get to something where your

786
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,799
cloud is your main product line really

787
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,200
important speed is still critical

788
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,720
we're probably we need to start looking

789
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,120
at integrated security games

790
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,039
we need to like start building out like

791
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,559
most of the major cloud providers

792
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,559
bespoke uh

793
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,120
paved roads so to speak so that

794
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,520
developers and engineers and smes can

795
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,080
find the easy way to the right tools to

796
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,880
install and continue to build quickly

797
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,679
so

798
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,520
what you do with this model now

799
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,640
obviously you don't see any of your

800
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,399
favorite isos

801
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:35,679
blah blah domains they're sorry uh

802
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,080
take this take cis take iso or my

803
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,600
recommendations the cloud take these

804
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,440
cloud security alliances 14 control

805
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,080
domains layer those on the top pull them

806
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,760
down across this and see how far you

807
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,200
want to embed each of your control

808
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,279
domains that's how you build your

809
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,799
starting point for figuring out a new

810
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,120
cloud model

811
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,480
i'm not talking through this slide this

812
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,360
is the 45-minute version of the talk but

813
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,039
if you look at these slides later after

814
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,640
we uh

815
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,320
after these are published you can look

816
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,760
at these just for some patterns or

817
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,679
anti-patterns that were

818
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,159
trying to avoid doing in the cloud

819
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,320
security environments

820
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,120
so

821
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,640
i'm going to wrap up in a second sorry

822
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,880
for the fire hose i do talk a lot and i

823
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,200
have a lot of information as promised

824
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,640
there's going to be links on the next

825
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,399
page right after this wrapping it all up

826
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:24,640
well we're out of touch as central

827
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,159
security functions we need to do better

828
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,320
for our engineers we need to align a

829
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,559
security model we need to

830
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,880
put in the work to get this right

831
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,080
and i've just talked through all the

832
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,720
changes we have to do they're um

833
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,320
repeated here for your convenience but

834
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,600
let's start partnering with the business

835
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,760
let's start engaging them

836
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,240
so yes let's start getting cloud
