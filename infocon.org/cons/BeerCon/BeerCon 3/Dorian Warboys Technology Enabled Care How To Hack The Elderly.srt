1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:03,199
excellent good luck

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:04,640
all right so

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,240
uh what is teddy care or

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,360
technology enabled care it's a system

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,799
that was

6
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:17,400
basically in invented to

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,160
basically a system that was developed to

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:22,960
help

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,359
things like care homes and residential

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,240
homes

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,800
increase response time for emergencies

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,000
it was designed in 1957

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,800
the original system was wix uh invented

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,559
by tunstall buyers a little company in

15
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,200
yorkshire it's basically the pool calls

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,800
you see in

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,280
residential homes care homes

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,360
like the red strings you see that get

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,239
pulled

20
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:47,039
they

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,640
raise an emergency response

22
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,640
so

23
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,960
as they went through from wix which took

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,559
up a whole

25
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,559
wall in an office

26
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,120
they eventually came through with

27
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,520
piper group or piper

28
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,360
solo which was the first in the

29
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,520
communicable series

30
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,080
it was still very basic but it

31
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,000
brought down all of the equipment all of

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,240
the control equipment into

33
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,960
like a foot and a half square box

34
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,040
with some peripherals but it meant that

35
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,360
there was a lot of space saved with it

36
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,200
and it managed to integrate a lot more

37
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,200
equipment

38
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,240
come 2006

39
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,759
there'd been a lot of

40
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,320
iterations in the communicable series

41
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,920
between now and or then in 2006

42
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,640
but

43
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,280
in 2006 the

44
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,520
communicable connect was released it was

45
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,200
the first of the

46
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,240
computerized versions which it ran on

47
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,280
windows c5

48
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,360
they upgraded this to what they call

49
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,600
connect 6 or connect vi um in 2013 that

50
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,040
runs on ce6 and it's still running on

51
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,040
ce6 to this day

52
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,479
the older version the 2006 version was

53
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,320
programmed through java applets over a

54
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,360
web interface um the

55
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,360
the newer version moved all that across

56
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,239
to

57
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,640
a javascript client-side thing which

58
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,080
meant that

59
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,680
service engineers found it easier

60
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,480
because there was a lot of problems with

61
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,720
the the laptops

62
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,160
basically none of the laptops were

63
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,920
working with the java applets so they

64
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,760
moved it across to javascript

65
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,920
which had its own

66
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,920
set of

67
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,720
horrific faults

68
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,000
so a day in the life of one of the

69
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,480
residents of one of these uh sites would

70
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,519
be

71
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,000
uh let's say we've got fred

72
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,840
so he feels a little off one day but he

73
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,599
he'll go out for his morning stroll to

74
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,080
get his paper like he does every day

75
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,400
and then he'll come back and there's

76
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,080
usually on these sort of sites there's

77
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,239
something like a coffee morning where

78
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,000
they can go and they can sit and have

79
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,519
tea and coffee biscuits and things like

80
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:58,319
that

81
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,280
have a bit of a sense of community um

82
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,280
then you know he'll go back up to his

83
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,519
his apartment and he'd all

84
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,959
sit and have a

85
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:07,760
you know

86
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,360
his family will come over

87
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,239
um

88
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,560
they'll sit there having a catch up and

89
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,159
then eventually at the end of the day

90
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,840
when everyone's

91
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,400
gone and he's he's on his own say he

92
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,239
wants to have a shower

93
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,000
before bed

94
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,840
slips as he's getting out there's going

95
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,920
to be a red string or if he's had the

96
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,599
sense to keep his pendant with him which

97
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,840
is a radio device basically like a radio

98
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,519
um a radio pool called if he's had the

99
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,400
sense to keep that with him he can press

100
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,560
or pull the pull cord and raise a

101
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,400
response from

102
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,879
if if someone's on duty at the time it

103
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,879
will be on-site staff if someone's not

104
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,799
on site it will go through to an alarm

105
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,519
receiving center or an arc

106
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,440
and that will they can then decide

107
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,480
whether they're going to bring in

108
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,439
emergency services

109
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,640
so a development manager which is more

110
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,239
like a residential home rather than a

111
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,159
care home but you get development

112
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,480
managers and their job is to

113
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,239
you know the job description is to look

114
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,080
after the building but they do

115
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,760
some level of looking after the

116
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,200
residents as well

117
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,080
um so say christina arrives at work

118
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,840
she'll perform the first thing she does

119
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,839
is perform welfare calls for all of the

120
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,880
residents

121
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,759
and they will

122
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,199
basically she checks that they're all

123
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,280
okay and there's no issues with them if

124
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,440
there is issues she can action those

125
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,560
issues

126
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,560
anyone that's vulnerable or doesn't

127
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,400
answer she will go and knock on their

128
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,240
apartment give them a face to face just

129
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,720
to check they're okay

130
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,440
once a week they're required to

131
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,639
action a

132
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,240
fire alarm test for the communal fire

133
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,440
alarm system um when they do that

134
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,800
they will

135
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,360
test a point around around the building

136
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,639
that will then go through and use the

137
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,280
telecare enabled care system to then

138
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,000
raise a call through to the care line or

139
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,280
the ark which

140
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,639
as long as they know it's a test they

141
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,560
won't action it if they don't know it's

142
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,520
a test

143
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,440
it will go straight through to the fire

144
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,800
brigade and you'll get a

145
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,000
response it can also be used as

146
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,479
a concierge system so if

147
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,960
you'll get a lot of um pharmacies and

148
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,960
carers things like that trying to gain

149
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,840
access if they can't reach their

150
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,280
their resident that they need to speak

151
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,360
to they can use the concierge part of

152
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,400
this system to speak to

153
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,080
the even the development managers or the

154
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,840
care team who can then grant them access

155
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,360
if it's out of hours and there's no

156
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,919
staff on site they can obviously speak

157
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,720
to the alarm receiving center and

158
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,120
be granted access that way

159
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,000
so

160
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,960
a typical system this is the

161
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,800
the typical thing you would see on a

162
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,600
site

163
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,400
in the middle you've got the um

164
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,400
what we call the control unit or sim

165
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,000
board

166
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,520
that

167
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,199
most of that stuff you wouldn't have to

168
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,800
worry about in this thing in this

169
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,240
situation but

170
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,080
the main things to take away from it are

171
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,080
l1 on the left hand side you've got

172
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,240
connected to a telephone line that's a

173
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,280
basic bt telephone line nothing special

174
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,680
about it no red care no nothing

175
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,360
that is

176
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,960
their sole

177
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,039
connectivity to the alarm receiving

178
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,440
center

179
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,240
the other bits are

180
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,080
it's just fancy stuff to add to the

181
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,080
system uh the speech modules are

182
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,520
obviously the bits that are going into

183
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,639
the apartments

184
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,440
uh the 869 receivers are well teddyco

185
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,160
overlay is what is receiving the calls

186
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,360
or the

187
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,440
signals from anything like a radio

188
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,960
device like a pendant or uh radio pool

189
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,880
called smoke detectors

190
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,400
the hsp

191
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,520
is

192
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,840
um it's basically what we call tunstall

193
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,240
tablet which is a

194
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,240
little device that is sometimes given to

195
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,599
managers

196
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,599
or care staff so that they can

197
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,080
program some things without being

198
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,720
like a control unit

199
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,400
sometimes they are connected to the

200
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,880
internet which is where most of our risk

201
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,639
comes from

202
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,520
um

203
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,240
but yeah that's essentially what uh the

204
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,360
typical analog system would look like

205
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,880
um

206
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,520
for this is

207
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,160
the newer versions of connect or connect

208
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,319
six connect vi whatever however they

209
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,120
want to say it um the newer versions

210
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,199
they brought out had

211
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,840
what they called vip which wasn't really

212
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,160
ip it was kind of a

213
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,000
as you can see from the right hand side

214
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,919
of this it's

215
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,919
their analog cable going into what they

216
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,639
called an sci which was designed to look

217
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,280
remarkably like a 19-inch

218
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,440
router or switch

219
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,879
that then

220
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,120
interfaced cat6 cabling into each flats

221
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,840
was a star-wide system

222
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,120
but it wasn't ip it's none of it is ip

223
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,720
other than the ipvx on the bottom left

224
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,759
which

225
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,680
is

226
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,280
what you would say is one of the big

227
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,039
problems with this type of system is if

228
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,879
they go down this route of

229
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,280
putting it in this way

230
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,599
everything is internet in facing like

231
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,840
there's there's no way around it

232
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,560
the on the analog systems

233
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,039
some are internet facing some aren't

234
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,919
there's enough on there to be a risk

235
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,080
this each one of these would be internet

236
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,479
facing

237
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,280
so in a typical apartment you'd have

238
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,120
for an analog system you'd have a 10

239
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,519
core cable which goes through as daisy

240
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,760
chained in and out of flats

241
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,760
and that would be going into this pcb

242
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,399
which would be connected to the

243
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,919
speech unit

244
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,519
on the right hand side you'd have pull

245
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,200
chords which are

246
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,720
normally closed just what we call a

247
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,880
closed loop which is for mono strings so

248
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,640
if you have um

249
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,000
cabling issues

250
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,440
it would go into

251
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,600
it just it would just constantly call

252
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,040
and you would know that there's an issue

253
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,320
with that and that could be seen too if

254
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,800
it was a normally open circuit

255
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,839
um you would have issues in that

256
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,120
you wouldn't know that they're failing

257
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,399
until you were trying to use them and

258
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,800
they failed which is obviously not

259
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,160
really what you want

260
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,760
the detectors on the

261
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,360
the left-hand side

262
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,760
that would be things like a smoke sector

263
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,680
carbon monoxide detector

264
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,600
and they would just trigger their input

265
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,200
that they're set up for and

266
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,279
that would then tell whoever's on the

267
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,920
receiving end of the alarm calls that

268
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,399
that is you know it's come from a smoker

269
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,959
sector input from fred's flat or

270
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,279
carbon monoxide detector so they could

271
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,480
respond accordingly

272
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,279
so why is patching these systems hard

273
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,080
the

274
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,120
big thing is they're with the way these

275
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,760
sites are run in my experience

276
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,360
they're just going to be hard to patch

277
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,600
because of the way they're funded

278
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,320
no costs are incurred by the landlord

279
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,560
it's all passed down to the residents

280
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,440
and

281
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,920
none of them want to pay for

282
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,080
people like you know an engineer like me

283
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,399
to go to site to upgrade software when

284
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,600
they think

285
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,920
there's no reason to this it's not going

286
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,640
to

287
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,160
gain them anything so they're not going

288
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,600
to want to do it

289
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,440
not all sites are internet facing so

290
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,079
it's not going to matter for all of them

291
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,560
but there are enough

292
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,200
that it's an issue for quite a few sites

293
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,959
systems can fall over mid upgrade um

294
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,640
if you're upgrading it

295
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,360
over the internet uh these systems do

296
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,000
have a tendency every now and again to

297
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,079
just fall flat on their face mid-upgrade

298
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,920
and then you'll have to send an engineer

299
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,880
anyway so it's a lot easier just to have

300
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,680
someone on site doing the upgrade

301
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,640
and

302
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,160
just make it easier

303
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,079
some field engineers are completely

304
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,399
scared of doing the upgrades because

305
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,920
there are issues with it and they can be

306
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,760
if you don't have experience in it they

307
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,640
are

308
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,480
they can be a horror show

309
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,720
there's database compatibility issues

310
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,240
between the 2006 connect and the 2013

311
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,160
connect if you're

312
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,720
the boards are different

313
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,320
but they are compatible you can run

314
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,519
either on

315
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,560
either side but

316
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,240
you will have to rebuild the databases

317
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,959
if you're switching from a 2006 to a

318
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,000
2008 and that is usually done by hand

319
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,959
because

320
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,160
it's it's just a nightmare um and the

321
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,240
legacy systems which is what the analog

322
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,000
type are they're not supported anymore

323
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
anyway um

324
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,120
i've

325
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,760
submitted some bugs to uh

326
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,760
not tons of another vendor um and those

327
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,760
the the words given to me were they're

328
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,760
not all that worried about and because

329
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,240
the legacy systems and

330
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,480
um

331
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,079
they're not going to worry about because

332
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,160
they're more focused on their ip

333
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,600
equipment which is

334
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,839
to paraphrase exactly what said to me

335
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:54,959
which is

336
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,959
worrying

337
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:57,760
so

338
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,360
examples of

339
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,959
exploitation for these systems if you've

340
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,880
got a script kitty

341
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,880
one of the simple things is it's only a

342
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,320
win windows ce back end it's it falls

343
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,279
over

344
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,680
his own feet sometimes it's

345
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,160
they're horrific um

346
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,480
it's pretty easy to ddos these i mean

347
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,000
you haven't got to do much to them to

348
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,480
get them to fall over

349
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,760
if there's any firewall

350
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,800
misconfigurations that leave other ports

351
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,959
open on these um

352
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,279
there's a huge risk because one of the

353
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,680
biggest risks is

354
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,480
there's

355
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,880
they leave telnet open with no

356
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,240
authentication

357
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,639
whatsoever and it just dumps you

358
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,320
straight into the command prompt then

359
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,079
you could just deal treat a lot of it

360
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,480
and just kill the system and then it's

361
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,560
not getting fixed until a board's coming

362
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,079
out with an engineer to replace the

363
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,000
thing

364
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,040
uh the inside threats would be

365
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,519
someone like me if i was going to a site

366
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,720
and

367
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,600
i was

368
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,480
you know i i wanted to cause some damage

369
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,240
there's plenty of things i could do i

370
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,480
have access to the

371
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,040
service level um settings and things

372
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,240
like that

373
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,839
disconnecting phone lines is another

374
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,320
easy one um switching off the controller

375
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,839
is an easy one the only issues with

376
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,040
those are

377
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,040
if you were doing those

378
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,519
they would be cool because the alarm

379
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,519
receiving center will repeatedly

380
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:22,639
throughout the day

381
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,040
um test the systems

382
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,880
uh to make sure they're responding to

383
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,800
calls if you've got it disconnected in

384
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,800
any way that will be raised as a fault

385
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,240
and an engineer would be sent out to

386
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,480
rectify hopefully it's not the the same

387
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,399
engineer

388
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,760
um

389
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,959
killware

390
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,680
is the kind of the new password

391
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,320
from what i've been seeing um

392
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,519
if you wanted to find these showdown

393
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,800
will give you

394
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,680
enough of them um but if you don't have

395
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,279
access to showdown

396
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,160
google dorking and some brain cells if

397
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,720
you know subnet and then you can run a

398
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,040
map scan you can find quite a lot of

399
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,399
them um

400
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,440
that's

401
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,680
how i sort of came up with some numbers

402
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,959
for research

403
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,600
uh denying service to the controller is

404
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,320
a huge risk for life if

405
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,639
there's plenty of ways to deny

406
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,720
the the service of it

407
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,279
and obviously you've got on quite a lot

408
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,360
of these sites upwards of

409
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,160
40 apartments up to i've seen some that

410
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,440
are in the sort of mid hundreds and

411
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,360
if you're denying access to that you

412
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,519
could be you know if you did

413
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,040
access denial on a friday evening leave

414
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,000
that left it off all weekend

415
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
you could potentially kill quite a lot

416
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,880
of residents i'd say

417
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,480
obviously the the other way of doing it

418
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,480
is if you don't want to completely bead

419
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,399
off it or anything like that if you

420
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,320
were looking to attack these one of the

421
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,680
simplest things would be if you could

422
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,279
get into the settings

423
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,240
and

424
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,920
disable these devices through the

425
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,440
database

426
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,279
that's a lot quieter and it's going to

427
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,360
take an engineer a lot

428
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,600
longer to discover that and start

429
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,240
rectifying it

430
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,920
which brings us to

431
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,279
zero days

432
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,839
are there any zero

433
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,920
days um yeah there's there's quite a few

434
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,160
to be honest there's um

435
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,600
obviously i'm not gonna go into great

436
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,120
detail

437
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,040
but the

438
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,040
to to sign into these things it's a lot

439
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,880
like um

440
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,720
i always think of it like a poor man's

441
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,959
secure rsa when you used to get the the

442
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,720
card with the numbers that would come up

443
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,639
and regenerate every now and again or

444
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,199
now like uh authenticate your apps

445
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,120
um you have a daily code when you try

446
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,800
logging in if you're trying to log in as

447
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,880
a service user

448
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,480
that

449
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,680
can be

450
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,519
you are supposed to take that code send

451
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,160
it off to tunstall the vendor and they

452
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,440
will send you back a working password

453
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,480
that

454
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,880
same hashing algorithm has been used

455
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,800
since 2006 and it's it's

456
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,240
this week to be honest um it i cracked

457
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,839
it originally through reverse

458
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,160
engineering the old java applet

459
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,560
um obviously at that point you needed uh

460
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,160
file system access

461
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,160
um luckily on the the new 2013

462
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,639
edition of connect they linked it in the

463
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,160
javascript files as you can see from the

464
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,160
screenshot which was really nice that

465
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,800
they released the key for it and you can

466
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,079
see everything that you need to really

467
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,680
uh the other

468
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,199
or one of the other

469
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,279
big risks that is

470
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,759
with this is the final functional

471
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,000
testing facility that they've

472
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,240
given for the quality assurance testers

473
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,759
in they're supposed to be used in

474
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,360
factory um

475
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,040
but it can be reached without

476
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,759
authentication without issues you can

477
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,399
perform system resets you can actuate

478
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,959
the on-board relays on the control board

479
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,320
which are

480
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,720
typically connected to things like

481
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,440
fire systems or

482
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,600
smoke vent systems typically anything

483
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,000
that's going to evacuate a building is

484
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,640
connected to those so if you were

485
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,319
actuating those from across the internet

486
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,240
you are

487
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,559
raising a response from a fire brigade

488
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,359
most likely and evacuating a building

489
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,799
or possibly

490
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,000
uh if they've got a stay put policy then

491
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,319
it might not be as bad but it's still

492
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,160
going to be putting everyone into panic

493
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,120
and you can switch the uh

494
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,679
the main phone line that goes off to the

495
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,880
telephone network um has a gsm modem

496
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,440
backup facility

497
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,880
typically they're not connected there's

498
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,960
no gsm modems unless they're a real

499
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,400
special case

500
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,559
but if you flip the

501
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,200
the relay for it you can switch it to

502
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,280
gsm it won't register that it's not got

503
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,760
a phone line and it won't switch back to

504
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,840
the pstn so you've effectively

505
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,960
disconnected the outgoing line and it

506
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,360
to my knowledge it doesn't report that

507
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,559
in any way shape or form

508
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,960
so

509
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,760
the sqlite 3

510
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,600
back end is accessible through

511
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,480
sql injection a weird sql injection that

512
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,360
they've

513
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,120
they've developed

514
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,799
again like the final functional testing

515
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,960
they've got this facility where you can

516
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,200
run it and they give it all away in the

517
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,919
javascript and luckily as you can see on

518
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,559
the right the only sanitization is done

519
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,799
client sides as soon as you script this

520
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,760
out yourself you bypass all of that and

521
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,160
you know it's a cakewalk

522
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,400
from there you can

523
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,600
disable

524
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,919
apartments so you can completely disable

525
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,240
the the calling from them uh you can

526
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,799
remove any of their pendants or radio

527
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,400
smoke detectors

528
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,039
you can change the alarm center dialing

529
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,039
numbers so that it can't dial through to

530
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,960
the right centers i mean you could set

531
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,720
that to whatever phone number you'd want

532
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,440
and you can even revert the board to

533
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,080
factory settings is something i recently

534
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,400
discovered through a certain request

535
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,640
which is that just completely wipes out

536
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,960
the system it can't buy anything if we

537
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,360
just it won't even know where it is

538
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,840
basically it has no recollection of any

539
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,480
of its settings

540
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,200
and the tunstall tablet software hsp

541
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,440
that i mentioned in the

542
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,000
yeah in the diagram of like the

543
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,120
what does the normal systems look like

544
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,280
they have hard-coded

545
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,360
plain text credentials just

546
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,320
sitting in

547
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,120
the dotnet software which as you can see

548
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,960
the the

549
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,039
the passwords aren't that creative and

550
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,960
if you had a permutation engine that

551
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,559
you'd run them through

552
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,320
you'd be

553
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,400
you'd find your way onto the wi-fi

554
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,960
systems as well to be honest um and the

555
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,559
good thing is

556
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,160
the wi-fi systems

557
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,480
they're all the same on every site so

558
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,360
yeah

559
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,799
once you've cracked one you've cracked

560
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,120
them all

561
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,159
so the poor practices

562
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,559
of

563
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,520
the all these manufacturers have done

564
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,200
some poor practices

565
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,400
uh

566
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,559
every vendor that i know has the the

567
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,640
same credentials on every site it's the

568
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,120
idea is to make it easier for

569
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,640
engineers like me that are attending

570
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,559
sites so that you can just save it once

571
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,720
and then your laptop will work on any

572
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,960
site

573
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,080
that is not a great way of doing things

574
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,240
in my opinion it would be easier to have

575
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,760
like a centralized database that you

576
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,159
could all log into to get this stuff

577
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,400
from

578
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,600
the

579
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,799
credentials for another vendor timetech

580
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,960
they publish the credentials in their

581
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,200
public manuals

582
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,200
for a lot of this stuff

583
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,440
granted time tech because

584
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,520
of the way the system's built it's not

585
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,159
as susceptible to a lot of this stuff

586
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:57,520
but it's still not great to be

587
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,760
publishing all your passwords and you

588
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,960
know your your service level passwords

589
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,880
on for everyone to see

590
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,000
uh

591
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,480
obviously tunstall is still using telnet

592
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,080
and ftp with anonymous logins in 2021

593
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,120
which is

594
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,559
not great

595
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,039
the control software like the hsp

596
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:17,840
um

597
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,440
i mean leaving plain text credentials is

598
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,480
yes that's a pretty basic thing i would

599
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,880
have said not to do

600
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,280
uh the testing suite the the final

601
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,840
functional testing suite is just

602
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,640
you can get there from anywhere it's

603
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,080
as soon as you found one of these

604
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,520
systems you can

605
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,440
get straight into that and start playing

606
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,640
which is not a great way to be i don't

607
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,440
think

608
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,880
um

609
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,039
the sql injection obviously is a is

610
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,000
another big worry um

611
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,880
you're

612
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,960
putting a lot of stuff at risk i'd say

613
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,400
by

614
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,320
leaving the sql injection just open to

615
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,840
anyone that has found that floor and can

616
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,840
do what they need to do they can pretty

617
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,360
much do anything at that point

618
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,520
the next generation of systems

619
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,080
when we're talking about gen systems in

620
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,799
uh ward and cool it's like full ip

621
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,360
systems like um apello is the big one at

622
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,919
the moment that is bringing out there's

623
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,919
is full ip tunstalls full ip systems my

624
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,720
knowledge are still a kind of a

625
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,559
bastardization of a

626
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,039
standard system mixed in with ip and

627
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:31,840
it's

628
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,320
it's like everything still do gets into

629
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,679
being a bit of a mess to be honest

630
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,960
um apello like i said it's full ip

631
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,520
everything in the flats it's all

632
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,960
um

633
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,960
like networked it's all tablets and

634
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,360
things like that and it's connected to

635
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,240
uh an ip enabled

636
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,840
alarm center over a vpn

637
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,760
obviously it the android tablets that go

638
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,600
into the apartments they all have

639
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,600
cameras attached so

640
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,200
in my opinion

641
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,200
having that and everything else and

642
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,799
knowing the security that is put in

643
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,760
place built into some of these systems

644
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,880
is

645
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,240
kind of a risk

646
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,240
especially when you consider that any

647
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,720
device on these systems is a network

648
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,640
pool so

649
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,480
if you've got a

650
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,640
door panel i can take that door panel

651
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,640
off and i've got you know if i had a

652
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,159
network tap i could install that

653
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,000
straight onto the back of it and i've

654
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,840
got network access

655
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,640
um it's as easy as that any any device

656
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,240
on that system

657
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,640
anything that is installed goes on to

658
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,760
the network

659
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,440
and is

660
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,400
quite easily accessible just by you know

661
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,320
taking something off the wall

662
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,840
you've got network connectivity there

663
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,480
um the wi-fi passwords

664
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,200
like i say every vendor that i know

665
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,840
uses the same passwords on every site

666
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,279
because it's easier for service

667
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:58,640
engineers

668
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,200
and the problem is that also makes it

669
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,760
easier for everyone else

670
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,760
as soon as you've got a password you can

671
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,000
get into any of them

672
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,840
and you know

673
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,000
do whatever you want to on those systems

674
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,440
and obviously the

675
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,120
one of the big things with the the newer

676
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,880
systems

677
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:22,000
you've got android malware becoming more

678
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:23,600
yeah

679
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,360
android malware is getting everywhere

680
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,679
now and if you've got android tablets in

681
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,440
every single apartment of these

682
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,279
buildings

683
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,279
it is you know

684
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,360
it doesn't take a genius to start

685
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,559
working out what can happen there

686
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,960
um but yeah that is

687
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,120
the end

688
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,960
brilliant dorian that's fantastic thank

689
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,320
you very much

690
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,559
i i think he went in a totally different

691
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,320
direction from what i was thinking

692
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,520
absolutely

693
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,640
and also an extremely important reminder

694
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,760
that the the things in the internet of

695
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,320
things yeah can be absolutely anything

696
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,400
and often things people don't even think

697
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,200
about

698
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,640
yeah so i think that was absolutely

699
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,320
amazing and you know it's it's really

700
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,120
interesting because like you said um the

701
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,159
the elderly cyber security awareness is

702
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,080
just probably not very high at all and

703
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,720
it's almost a disservice really that

704
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,000
companies are putting in these

705
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,559
incredibly vulnerable devices like you

706
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,559
know i'm a big fan of

707
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,240
uh of like not allowing ftp not allowing

708
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,880
you know telnet and you know over

709
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,240
using ssh instead but like you said if

710
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,559
everything is default um because they're

711
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,480
not taking the time to like do unique

712
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,159
passwords and stuff like that it's a

713
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,320
disaster waiting to happen definitely is

714
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,600
100

715
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,720
yeah

716
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,720
a bit of a horror story but a lot of

717
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,760
learning

718
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,080
and takeaways for people from that talk

719
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:54,799
so

720
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,799
yeah brilliant stuff i know you said you

721
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,480
were nervous at the beginning but to be

722
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,760
perfectly honest

723
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,279
we couldn't tell

724
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,080
so

725
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,480
