1
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,400
so

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,679
in this section we were asked to prepare

3
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,160
a quiz for the beer farmers rather than

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,760
the beer farmers doing the quiz so now

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,320
they are in the hot seat so i was asked

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,080
for jeopardy and hey

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,000
we're now going to put the beer farmers

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,320
in jeopardy apparently there may or may

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,800
not have been a game show called

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,960
jeopardy didn't know okay right so in

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,880
part just before i continue dave yeah

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,719
you are dave not sure

13
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,320
that is that is true that's true that's

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,920
what he said the viewers

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,920
the viewers may think you're sure but

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,520
yeah

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,480
yes

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,360
this is fine i've got a few a few more

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,399
things to say

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,120
no

21
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,399
no you do not

22
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,360
so there has been some safety concerns

23
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,719
raised about the quick fire round

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,879
especially with all the nerf guns

25
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,920
so because we take your safety seriously

26
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,079
uh if we could open the box in front of

27
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,320
you gentlemen and choose wisely

28
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,280
this is like an unboxing video and [ __ ]

29
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,920
you for putting spiders

30
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,439
we spend all these months

31
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,520
painstakingly painstakingly putting

32
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,840
together a conference for the community

33
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,759
and this is how we get paid back all

34
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,200
right

35
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,960
i like the way i'm the last to get oh

36
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,839
boy a choice

37
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,200
wow

38
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,680
so if you could don your safety goggles

39
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,930
there's only three

40
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,720
[Laughter]

41
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,960
oh yeah that's so appropriate

42
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,839
this this is gonna take me okay

43
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,320
that's probably a good thing

44
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,600
not really

45
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,920
your dog your capabilities of dodging

46
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,799
are so exciting uh and

47
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,880
simply because uh we wanted everything

48
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,119
to be really safe and to bring back some

49
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,240
nice memories for scott

50
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,200
at one point scott may have mentioned

51
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,560
that he's really good at getting out of

52
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,480
handcuffs so scott you've got until the

53
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,799
end oh

54
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,440
dear so scott's got until the end of the

55
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,599
quiz to uh get himself out of the

56
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,599
hangouts okay good job scott

57
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,480

58
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,640
of happier

59
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,959
question number one gentlemen

60
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,879
so we're always slating people for

61
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,000
dealing with their incidents really

62
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,280
badly but

63
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,440
who did a really good one come on let's

64
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,120
let's give some let's give a shout out

65
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,800
to somebody that actually dealt with

66
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,440
their instant well time hop

67
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,319
yeah

68
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,120
yeah they were good mask we're pretty

69
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,280
good immersed i'll give them to

70
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,360
you over here

71
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,280
discord didn't they do this quite well

72
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,879
discord did their

73
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,959
come on give me why did they do them

74
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,800
what we're teaching people how to do

75
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,319
good incidents here while looking

76
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,720
ridiculous on my two examples time hop

77
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,120
we're very quick to respond to users

78
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,280
they got their comms plan engaged and

79
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,360
executed really effectively and they

80
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,760
were anatomical in the level of detail

81
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,360
they went back to users about in terms

82
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,959
of the cause of the breach the nature of

83
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,319
the data that was breached and what they

84
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,360
were doing about it in remediation

85
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,440
mask were completely screwed

86
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,680
but what they did do very well was set

87
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,000
up azure websites that allowed at least

88
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,840
a basic form of communication to go out

89
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,480
to their business on their stakeholders

90
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,159
and the other good thing they did was

91
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,920
leave a domain controller switched off

92
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,920
in africa which allowed them to rebuild

93
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,680
their entire active directory after the

94
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,080
incident if only they'd meant that but

95
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,000
okay

96
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,920
thanks for having me guys better to be

97
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,239
lucky than good huh

98
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,799
up the toilet's there

99
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,720
never have i been so pleased anyway um

100
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,319
no that was good that was good that was

101
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,840
a good one yep

102
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,840
any other particularly good instance no

103
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,360
do you want to show it i think those

104
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,280
those are the powerful ones yeah well

105
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,120
moral story is have a plan and tell

106
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,639
people about it

107
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,639
yeah it definitely works well don't

108
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,358
don't don't lie and all that

109
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,680
excellent right do i get i got points

110
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,600
for this yes yes 1000 points

111
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,840
okay then so uh

112
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,199
we don't care how many twitter followers

113
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,680
you've got but

114
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,880
what's been your biggest loss

115
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,680
me oh

116
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,360
259 followers

117
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,440
in a week yeah oh it's last christmas

118
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,280
wasn't it and that was just around new

119
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,360
year and that was because i rather

120
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,080
stupidly called somebody a [ __ ]

121
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,240
with a hundred thousand followers

122
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,120
oops so it's a self-help for me this

123
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,960
yeah the important thing is marketing to

124
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,759
listen like he's listening a lot i i did

125
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,840
and i'm now a much more i mean it was my

126
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,320
only really bad stupid mistake that i

127
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,600
made but i was

128
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,039
it took me a while to recover from it

129
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,039
but yeah i did eventually recover from

130
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,199
it i was unblocked by the person that

131
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,880
originally blocked me for the

132
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,720
event the incident i think it's a life

133
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,039
lesson too it's like being magnanimous

134
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,840
and um accept apologies i think that's

135
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,160
important just it's that don't be a dick

136
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,759
yeah we're all a dick sometimes but

137
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,160
sometimes remember that you decided you

138
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,120
weren't going to be one again yep yeah

139
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,479
excellent good life lesson how are you

140
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:33,680
getting on there scott

141
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,680
got one hand out hey

142
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,560
this one i made tighter though so

143
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,919
it's like two steps forward one step

144
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,120
back but don't worry i know what the

145
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,000
problem is and i know how to fix it

146
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,720
we've heard that before today

147
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,360
scott are you actually got more people

148
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,120
blocking you than following you yet so i

149
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,199
did a little kind of troll to see

150
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,680
whether you could find out i like a list

151
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,360
of how many people are blocking you

152
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,440
apparently that's not part of twitter's

153
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,680
api um but yeah i am blocked by a [ __ ]

154
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,600
done see all those circle wheeled things

155
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,199
that people put up going oh here's my

156
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,919
biggest fans like my best game to do is

157
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,280
go through and count how many people

158
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,080
have me blocked it got so the number got

159
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,080
so large it's now a game of count how

160
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,560
many people like haven't got me blocked

161
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,880
so i would say half a tour easily half

162
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,240
of

163
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,600
yeah

164
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,520
good call

165
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,360
right so here's a game for you

166
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,400
name the job title of the person sitting

167
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,080
to your left and describe what their

168
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,720
typical day looks like

169
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,199

198
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,800
marketing

199
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,479
all true

200
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,280
um and ian

201
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,639
venezia

202

yes

205
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,639
the further up in

206
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,560
management i just think

207
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,680
these past few days the more

208
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,800
responsible you become

209
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,800
more proud it's always been a struggle

210
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,919
the responsibility

211
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,039
okay ian all right so uh mike well even

212
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,919
though his handle is upset bloke that is

213
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,919
a call to his past because he is a

214
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,919
senior manager of cyber security at zen

215
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,280
internet

216
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,400
and um he spends a lot of his day

217
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,440
helping

218
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,759
everyone in his company advance a

219
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,559
security agenda and of course he's our

220
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,958
go-to person for any internet issues

221
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,479
that we have because he's uh getting

222
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,320
there excellent

223
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,519
um

224
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,800
because he

225
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,600
zen is the preferred um internet service

226
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,080
for all of the beer farmers so if we

227
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,519
have a problem we call them up in the

228
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,120
middle of the night yeah literally

229
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,560
that's happening that that's happened

230
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,800
that is an excellent excellent answer

231
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,240
that's a good answer

232
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,360
so mike

233
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,360
do you have any idea what scott does all

234
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,720
day because i don't well i was gonna

235
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,240
wait a second

236
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,000
this is a concern that was actually

237
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,600
going to form part of the answer the

238
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,200
answer was well if you don't know david

239
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,360
but i'll have a go right right because

240
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,399
he

241
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,839
i think he's a senior soccer analyst or

242
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,360
at least he's involved in threatening

243
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,160
tell for quorum

244
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,480
um because that's what he tells us he

245
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,040
does that's right and he gets involved

246
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,360
in doing response incident response and

247
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,360
he dishes out support to colleagues that

248
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,560
are also doing incident response um

249
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,240
he drinks the rider

250
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,279
i do drink i don't know if you have a

251
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,800
ride there's a quorum i get i guess you

252
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,160
probably do

253
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,480
um very liberal expense policy so job

254
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,560
title that's a pure guess but that's the

255
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,399
kind of work that i think that he he

256
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,940
does in his average day he's a t-boy

257
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,880
[Laughter]

258
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,200
wow

259
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,160
so here's the thing remember that intern

260
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,120

261
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,839

262
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,040

263
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,600

264
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,480

265
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,160

266
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,120

okay we're doing we check you pay

268
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,320

269
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,480
work emails

270
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,440

271
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,120
this one this one's from sam uh okay

272
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,800

273
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,160
a minute

274
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,480
and and she would like to know how many

275
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,160
beer farmers it takes to change a light

276
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,519
bulb and when you're likely to get run

277
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,519
to it

278
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,200
well i don't know i mean we're looking

279
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,640
pretty washed out just now yeah

280
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,279
so actually you don't change them you

281
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,959
just throw them out when they stop

282
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,200
working do you do it or do you get

283
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,640
somebody to do it for oh god no i'm

284
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,360
strategic

285
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,880
[Laughter]

286
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,200
okay

287
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,519
so the beer farmers is an org now needs

288
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,120
to urgently rebrand there's some

289
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,560
nonsense going about

290
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,079
like the brand being aligned to data

291
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,839
slurping sucking and hate-mongering

292
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,519
robbery

293
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,600
what's the new name the beef harmons

294
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,160
no i think we should go by the a russian

295
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,440
cyber jihadis something dido we could do

296
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,480
that yeah team dada team died off yeah

297
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,440
apt dido we could do insider

298
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,720
team i know what the problem is

299
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,120
the brotherhood of mcafee oh yeah

300
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:45,920
yeah

301
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,360
see no no you're just you're trying to

302
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,880
score brownie points with sam oh yeah

303
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,880
unfortunately the name came too late

304
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,639
your marketing team's already got your

305
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,160
new logo so now you need to come up with

306
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,720
a name to match this

307
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,800
what's your new name and

308
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,319
the intractables is already taken

309
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,880
well we could call ourselves the tractor

310
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,200
boys but that's

311
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,920
right but well there are two reasons but

312
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,200
we have we have had female

313
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,279
representation in and i wouldn't rule

314
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,200
out that happening in the future

315
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,200
would welcome it so that doesn't work no

316
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,320
and the other reason it doesn't work is

317
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,079
because it's the nickname of ipswich

318
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,560
town football club they may have a thing

319
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,160
to say about that one they roll our new

320
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,680
twitter account out

321
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,160
so that's not going to work

322
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,519
look guys

323
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,680
cyber bumpkins

324
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,360
oh nice yeah yeah yeah

325
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,160
yeah whatever

326
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,760
go for it sean you had one right it has

327
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,440
been claimed that you guys bunch of

328
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,399
middle-aged white men are not inclusive

329
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,360
so when will the first aib beer farmer

330
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,440
be added to the ranks and will it be a

331
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,399
funny one well we tried this already

332
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,839
i mean we've been facilitating we've

333
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,000
been researching post quantum for about

334
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,560
three years now yeah um so we think

335
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,519
there is mileage in that technology um

336
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,519
but we have had a sort of ai in the past

337
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,240
and

338
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,399
we've we've experimented with bot

339
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,279
technology we did and there is a little

340
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,120
story around that which was when we

341
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,000
launched our uh fledgling apt bot

342
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,120
apt-bot hashtag apt-bot yeah and what we

343
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,600
did with that was we in our bare farmers

344
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,680
twitter account we use the api

345
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,360
and we presented it with a bunch of

346
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,600
information and created an algorithm

347
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,519
and what the algorithm would do would it

348
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,560
on

349
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,880
every morning would send a random email

350
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,240
out to

351
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,639
a bear pharma follower

352
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,480
effectively accusing them of launching a

353
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,279
malware of some sort under the name of a

354
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,680
supposed apt group yeah

355
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,360
it got us into a lot of trouble we

356
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,920
thought it was hilarious but um law

357
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,320
enforcement did not no and

358
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,480
we had actual individuals reaching out

359
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,120
to us on on twitter in dm saying why are

360
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,360

361

giving back to the community giving back

393
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,680
to the community that's where it is we

394
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,279
changed our twitter profile picture to

395
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,560
tom anderson from myspace oh yeah

396

i love it because that's cool because

397
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,759
you get you get them verified for the

398
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,120
little things like if you change your

399
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,759
name too often your image too often the

400
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,360
you know it's apparently incredibly

401
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,600
difficult to get verified but it's not

402
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,639
difficult to become unveiled don't start

403
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:47,519
right

404
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,120
we're trying our best to behave yeah

405
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,079
we're on the edge at the moment

406
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,600
a serious question for you so if the

407
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,600
doomsday clock measures how close to

408
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,839
armageddon we

409
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,440
are uh so

410
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,720
what's the time

411
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,839
at for the doomsday clock for cybers

412
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,440
like at what point do we go turn the

413
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,360
internet off it's just not bloody worth

414
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,000
it anymore are we there

415
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,320
that was last week wasn't it yeah i

416
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,759
think we

417
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,440
no it's it's interesting because like if

418
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,079
we if we look at like sort of the threat

419
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,800
assessment and the understanding that

420
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,480
you know we created the world's most

421
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,040
complex machine and we have absolutely

422
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,639
no uh

423
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,360
world governance of the internet

424
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,079
um i think that's pretty dangerous and i

425
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,480
think it's a pretty dangerous

426
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,399
situation i would call it three minutes

427
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,639
to midnight midnight being the internet

428
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,920
just melts down and like basically it

429
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,880
becomes

430
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,240
more it becomes too expensive to be on

431
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,519
the internet

432
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,399
um

433
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,680
than not

434
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,440
right yeah yeah

435
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,079
so i i'm thinking three minutes

436
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,280
you know throw that out there to the

437
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,119
other guys it's not the name of a band

438
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,799
three minutes to midnight yeah but it

439
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,119
sounds like a great band

440
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,039
well it could be a song by lincoln park

441
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,280
i don't know

442
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,400

443
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,160

444
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,760
yeah

445
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,520
three minutes to midnight three minutes

446
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,799
let's go with three it's a group

nice so just slightly

449
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,480
better than

450
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,799
nuclear climate rate change and covert

451
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,280
19 kilometers it depends if you know we

452
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,200
get verified on twitter yeah it's that

453
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,120
yeah at that point the internet shuts

454
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,280
down yeah pretty much yeah oh apparently

455
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,840
