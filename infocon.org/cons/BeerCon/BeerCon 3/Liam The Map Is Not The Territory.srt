1
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:03,679
cheers well thank you very much and uh

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:05,680
and hello everyone just um

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,080
uh just by a very quick introduction uh

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,599
my name's liam and i live in the

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,240
netherlands and uh and i do uh systems

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,799
of solution architecture for a company

7
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,680
and uh yeah so today we're going to talk

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,359
about uh

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,600
system systemic complexity

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,279
um and as i was going through these

11
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,119
slides you notice the excellent artwork

12
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:26,560
for this is that the more i looked at

13
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,240
them the more i felt a little bit like

14
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,720
the kind of live laugh love instagram

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,159
prosecco time

16
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,399
nonsense that you would see in

17
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,160
potentially my timeline

18
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,640
and so uh yeah enjoy the slides they're

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,200
all like this

20
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,800
um

21
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,960
so first up i can change slides of all

22
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,280
myself is uh it's really this i'm not

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,399
going to read off the entire thing but

24
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,600
really the

25
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,520
the idea of what we talk about systemic

26
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,920
complexity and systems themselves is

27
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,800
that

28
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,600
um is there not the thing

29
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,039
every time that we look at an image of

30
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,440
that is that the uh

31
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,520
if we have an abstract view of something

32
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,959
is that that is not the system it is

33
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,040
never the system and also the other side

34
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,560
of that is that the

35
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,479
um if you have a whole other system you

36
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,400
know i can completely copy the entire

37
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,200
thing

38
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,119
it doesn't give me any further insight

39
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,720
necessarily into what it does it allows

40
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,479
me to try it and give it a go but it's

41
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,280
not the one that we want so um

42
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,520
so you know if i have a if i clone

43
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,720
myself

44
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,799
doesn't then give me any better

45
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,119
understanding of how my pancreas works

46
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,280
unless i go digging around in that one

47
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,880
um

48
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,640
the idea is that the the more that we

49
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,680
look at

50
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,560
uh

51
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,560
systems and we provide abstract views of

52
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,400
that and kind of build up and build up

53
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,399
and build up to better understanding of

54
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:43,280
it

55
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,040
but there is also then

56
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,280
as well as these diagrams and state flow

57
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,880
diagrams and wordy descriptions and test

58
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,479
beds

59
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,320
is that they we're still viewing this

60
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,640
whole room through a keyhole

61
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,479
um and then we factor in and other

62
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,840
things that only we have these wordy

63
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,680
bits in the diagrams is there is a time

64
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,360
element to this and then we have a look

65
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,439
at over to about state flow diagrams is

66
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,880
that i assume that

67
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,119
um look at a stop and wait protocol like

68
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,160
tcp

69
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,160
is that oh i assume that everything's

70
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,200
going to work in this point while we're

71
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,560
waiting for something to happen the port

72
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,080
is opened and we're sat there listening

73
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,239
for a sin or something that's going to

74
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,120
come in

75
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,840
or close down

76
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,080
um every time that we model that in some

77
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,480
ways a little better insight into it but

78
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,080
it's not the thing it's still far as

79
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,520
scrap from the thing

80
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,879
uh and the other part with that is that

81
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:31,680
we

82
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,280
that we have a little model let's say we

83
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,840
build a test bed is that the the scale

84
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,680
doesn't necessarily work

85
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,400
um in the when we introduce those

86
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,720
from our little test bed into a larger

87
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,680
solution

88
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,760
and there's more factors coming in

89
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,480
so

90
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,920
do we know do we have a fully

91
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,840
understanding full understanding sorry

92
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,120
what is the

93
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,560
um the underlying infrastructure and

94
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,400
what we the process in which that is

95
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,840
used or

96
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,280
um

97
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,239
if i look at a hello world as a as a

98
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,920
serverless code

99
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,519
think of all of the stacks that sat

100
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,200
underneath that and our communication

101
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,599
with that service with an azure gcp or

102
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,040
something else

103
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,560
all those things that were kind of

104
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,080
irrelevant to us because our viewpoint

105
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,480
is very very narrow on there

106
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,000
but then i can give you

107
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,159
a diagram that shows how my interaction

108
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,680
with it works but it's still not the

109
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,120
system

110
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,120
so to sum up on that is that the chart

111
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,599
is not the patient which is easier to

112
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,040
remember than

113
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,360
order this one

114
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,799
uh and in that as well let's have a look

115
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,599
at me and pictures of cats uh and so we

116
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,840
have you know our http request and we

117
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,080
have a view of of how those

118
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,360
are as i'm flicking through slides and

119
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,159
then coming up as quickly um

120
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,360
you know here's the http responses

121
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,879
here's what content delivery looks like

122
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,159
here's what the web page looks like

123
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,519
there's a whole other things that that's

124
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:50,640
going on

125
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,959
that we don't capture within this

126
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,159
and it's impossible to capture because

127
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,159
the systems are so large i'm going to

128
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,159
say systems that means that

129
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,799
uh not necessarily like the ones we have

130
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,319
you know

131
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,640
uh expanding across multiple regions

132
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,000
your machine on your desktop is still a

133
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,840
complex system there's so much stuff in

134
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,560
there

135
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,159
that your abstract view of that and your

136
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,640
interface with it is very very narrow

137
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,959
and so within this that we don't capture

138
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,839
um

139
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,320
you know the fact that page rendered and

140
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,240
the the cables in the fiber and the

141
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,000
stacks and the switches and the routers

142
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
and everything that connects me

143
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,360
and my machine

144
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,280
to google's massive trove of cat

145
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,280
pictures and then there's the the bit

146
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,120
beyond that as well is that my my

147
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,639
interaction with the machine is rendered

148
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,600
on a page my monitor displays that i

149
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,600
have a look at pictures of cats and my

150
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,840
brain raises some serotonin and i have

151
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,840
the experience on bridal joy

152
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,840
that's still part of the system end to

153
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,080
end that we don't model and we just have

154
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,360
a look at

155
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,400
um

156
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,080
certainly technology and i'm very guilty

157
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,479
of it is to look at what is the

158
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,400
the process that's going on

159
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,479
would just be but we requested a page

160
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,800
and the page was served and the

161
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,320
various parts of that page was served

162
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,160
from here and here

163
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,240
and so it's difficult

164
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,600
to hold both that enormous the enormity

165
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,479
of this end-to-end

166
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,160
cat picture machine

167
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,680
as well as just going

168
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,600
and be able to find that and to

169
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,000
understand that um

170
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,919
but the point is at that point that

171
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,759
sorry point is at that point

172
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,680
what is here is that the

173
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,840
every time that we produce a view of

174
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,160
this is that the chart is not the

175
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,759
patient

176
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:32,720
um

177
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,880
so when we have

178
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,199
uh these diagrams put them into context

179
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,039
so what are we what are we talking about

180
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,440
when we have a um

181
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,639
a data flow diagram or that we have a

182
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,479
series of api calls and watching that

183
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,000
state through there

184
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,800
why is that useful to us

185
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,800
uh is because we need to understand it

186
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,800
at an abstract view because the enormity

187
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,840
of it is

188
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,000
is too much to handle in one go

189
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,360
um

190
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,759
everyone experiences that

191
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:02,550
and the the

192
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,919
[Music]

193
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:04,800
uh

194
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,639
so when you're looking at these uh

195
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,000
diagrams in context is you get a

196
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,759
uh a smaller understanding you build and

197
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,120
build and build

198
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,560
and so

199
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,639
that sort of brings us on to

200
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,639
um

201
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,960
the illusion of explanatory depth

202
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,280
um which is our comfort in what we

203
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,280
understand so if i were to say

204
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,280
some of the things that i work on that

205
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,039
how well do i understand that and i

206
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,120
would score that one to ten

207
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,960
in my most confident time say i'm a good

208
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,560
eight or nine

209
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,120
and at what point do you run out of

210
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,039
understanding of that thing so if i were

211
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,600
to ask um how a flush toilet works which

212
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,759
presumably we use every single day or

213
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,360
maybe once every two days depending on

214
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,120
your cycle

215
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,520
because i could probably explain that

216
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,680
to a reasonable depth

217
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,360
um and i understand that so you've got

218
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,880
to score that on one to ten how well do

219
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,560
i understand a flash toilet

220
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,120
i say a six or seven

221
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,479
at what point do i run out of

222
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,240
information

223
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,160
and then if i were to

224
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,919
press that further and further is that

225
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,759
there is a quite shitty interview

226
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,120
technique of doing that so you say

227
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,440
explain to me how ftp works and then you

228
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,639
keep asking questions until the

229
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,479
interviewee runs out of

230
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,800
confidence or answers

231
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,560
um it's an unpleasant experience having

232
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,800
had it and please don't do it

233
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,360
um because it's not very effective

234
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,960
um but what it the

235
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,680
what it does give you is

236
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,440
an understanding of your understanding a

237
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,400
bit

238
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,479
so if i can now sit here and explain how

239
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,319
a flash toilet works to my understanding

240
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,479
which i won't do i will spare you that

241
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,280
torture um and then reassess that

242
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,960
afterwards of what is on a scale of one

243
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,960
to ten what is my understanding of how

244
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,120
flash toilet works i will at some point

245
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,280
stop saying the words flush and toilet

246
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,199
um i probably feel that about two and a

247
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,639
three

248
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,879
that i know that i press the handle and

249
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,479
water comes out

250
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,560
and uh and waste then goes away

251
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,479
somewhere else but that in itself is

252
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,879
also part of a narrow very very very

253
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,440
narrow view of a larger system where is

254
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,599
the clean water coming from where is the

255
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,360
fouled water going to how is that

256
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,440
processed how do i then it comes back

257
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,520
out of my tap at some point later

258
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,440
and i still quite happily consume that

259
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,479
because it's refreshing and delicious

260
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:17,919
but i have no further understanding of

261
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,759
that and that is a flush toilet in

262
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,840
within a complex system

263
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,759
so if the simple

264
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,360
devices that we have within our homes

265
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,039
are difficult to explain

266
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,160
then what are we doing when we're

267
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,199
providing

268
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,520
um content delivery or we're doing for

269
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,120
providing security solutions or doing

270
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,719
these these uh

271
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,719
best technologies

272
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:37,760
is that there's

273
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,599
it's never simple

274
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,599
and it's far from simple but then the

275
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,279
other scale we have the understanding of

276
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,360
it needs to be simple for us to build

277
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,760
upon that and build upon that

278
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,600
and the point of this particular slide

279
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,040
is not to say

280
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,480
you don't understand things as well as

281
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,760
you think you do in a mean way it's to

282
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,720
really kind of take that step back

283
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,760
and to

284
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,040
avoid complacency is one of the things

285
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,240
um

286
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,920
and a complacency is a killer because

287
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,440
that gives you that

288
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,279
the thing is that i know everything

289
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,680
therefore i can assume that then if

290
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,880
you're doing physically in risk

291
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,000
assessments

292
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
that my understanding of not only my

293
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,680
system but the external threats the

294
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,360
internal threats

295
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,120
and those not just at any risk from

296
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,560
other things so

297
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,080
um if we look

298
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,880
for

299
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,200
um

300
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,279
risks again so i work in physical

301
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,200
security mainly if you look at the risk

302
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,320
against those then we have the

303
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,839
technology part of that is that what is

304
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:34,880
going to be

305
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,640
the threats to that

306
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,120
um do they include uh

307
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,800
people stuff turning up on showdown

308
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,640
people having a puppeteer absolutely so

309
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,160
we've got that element of it but what

310
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,440
happens when there's a bomb threat in

311
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,200
the building next door

312
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,000
and our building is then evacuated and

313
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,680
there's including the guarding because

314
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,880
what you have

315
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,080
in um

316
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,440
in bomb threats

317
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,279
uh is that you will have sort of 500

318
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,880
meter exclusion zone

319
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,079
uh which is to it doesn't matter

320
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,839
whether you would like to be continuing

321
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,200
working in there particularly if you

322
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,360
want to protect the building is that the

323
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,200
uh something in the uk someone from

324
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,040
flood will come along and say please

325
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,800
retire to this point

326
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,640
so your building's entirely empty the

327
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,000
things that are running in your sock and

328
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,600
everything else is now empty there's no

329
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,959
one in there

330
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,560
you put in your bc

331
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,480
processes but in your threat modeling

332
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,720
did you think of the building next door

333
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,279
did you think of someone with a backhoe

334
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,040
pulling up the cables into your data

335
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,839
center did you think of heavy flooding

336
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,040
and rain in an area that doesn't

337
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,480
necessarily have that

338
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,839
um

339
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,320
and so you've got this issue of the the

340
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,839
complacency of saying that i understand

341
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,000
everything and i and i have modeled

342
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,040
everything

343
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,959
versus you probably haven't scratched

344
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,040
the surface

345
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,240
and that's okay

346
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,240
because then you know we rely on each

347
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,720
other and we rely on prior learning and

348
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,079
we rely on

349
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,920
experience and

350
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,680
trying these things

351
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,519
but it also brings us to another one

352
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,640
which is

353
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,200
uh this is the sort of post event thing

354
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,800
and uh i'll thank uh

355
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,800
nico who said that when this when the

356
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,160
slide was originally up and he had a

357
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,680
review of it which was like yeah it's

358
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,279
like slide 6's

359
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,640
and so i've adjusted the contrast

360
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,480
hopefully that's now readable

361
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,200
um is that hindsight bias

362
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,600
is this kind of post event thing so if i

363
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,360
give you a crossword with the answers

364
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,720
filled out and you have a look at the

365
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,880
answers oh sorry the questions you go of

366
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,120
course i would get that one

367
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,120
it's very easy to slip into that mindset

368
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,360
so if you sit into a post-mortem for an

369
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,480
incident

370
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,800
um where there is a

371
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,240
uh it's been caused by a particular

372
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,760
thing because of course we thought of

373
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,760
that thing well actually we have a very

374
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,040
complex moving system um

375
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,560
of all the things that we

376
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,800
demonstrated we don't know about

377
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,399
we've got the answer well of course

378
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,160
that's a thing and that makes it

379
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,600
difficult why didn't the people in the

380
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,279
stock notice that why didn't the people

381
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,560
on the front desk notice that why didn't

382
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,639
the point of of understanding that

383
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,160
hindsight bias is there and it gives us

384
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,959
the the answer was obvious all along it

385
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,959
absolutely wasn't you're far from the

386
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,639
answer at all times um and so

387
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,079
this is another one where it's not a

388
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,000
telling off like with the illusion of

389
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,519
explanatory depth it's really to

390
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,720
understand that

391
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,320
when you're looking back at these things

392
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,279
is is what is the process or the break

393
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,040
in the process or system that brought

394
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,279
you to that point um

395
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,600
and allowed maybe a human element to it

396
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,200
um but it's to

397
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,200
really put into

398
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,079
uh be constructive in understanding that

399
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,240
hindsight bias is a thing

400
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,600
um

401
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,200
one of the

402
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,800
one of the worst that you get is that

403
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,720
you get a major incident we see quite

404
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,920
often and you know twitter goes

405
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,440
absolutely crazy for it how did they

406
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,680
miss this and so because they're looking

407
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,480
at everything else if you look at the um

408
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,279
uh

409
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,519
if you look at

410
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,680
heartbleed um there's two lines

411
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,519
somewhere stuck in the middle of the two

412
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,959
million lines of code

413
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,519
this is ridiculous why would why would a

414
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,639
request for a heartbeat respond with

415
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,399
massive chunks of um of memory

416
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,000
you're of course it's it'll be that

417
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,720
thing and it's very easy to get caught

418
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,160
in that thinking trap

419
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,839
um and the point is that there's two

420
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,200
medium lines of code

421
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,440
who's who's reviewing it and i know

422
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,600
happy very very happy with the open

423
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,959
source movement

424
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,000
is that

425
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,360
if you've got that many eyes on it why

426
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,040
did we miss this and you know the

427
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,760
problem there is that not everyone's

428
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,279
competent capable of looking in the

429
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,800
right places

430
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,079
um

431
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,279
so that's much harder to know

432
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,800
how to deal with that so what is the

433
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,240
process that would prevent that from

434
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,600
happening is it code review of two

435
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,519
million lines of code in a moving target

436
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,959
good luck

437
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,959
when i first started my career was in

438
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,639
software engineering in

439
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,199
in avionics for a defense contractor

440
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,440
when we had code reviews even the

441
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,120
smallest thing was sat in a room of five

442
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,120
or six people going through line by line

443
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,440
because these were going to go into

444
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,279
military aircraft

445
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,560
so you really need to know what's going

446
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,000
on in there and

447
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
i've fallen asleep in more than more

448
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,360
than one of those

449
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,120
um you can do that for two million lines

450
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,959
of code that's a long time to do but

451
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,399
then there's the risk associated with

452
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,399
that so it's the payoff of

453
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,480
spending that time to do it

454
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,199
is that the right process probably not

455
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:20,560
but that's a process needs to be looked

456
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,639
at and not the fact that

457
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,240
there's a there's a janky line of code

458
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,560
in there

459
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,399
um

460
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,839
and then even with that as well is that

461
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,279
we have

462
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,360
another problem is that

463
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,000
within a complex solution um is that you

464
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,160
can't just change one thing because it's

465
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,040
all

466
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,160
uh

467
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,360
uh

468
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,639
it shouldn't be closely coupled but

469
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,720
there are interactions between any one

470
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,399
component and any other component this

471
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,279
is all

472
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,279
interlinked at the same time you can't

473
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,519
just wholesale lift and shift the

474
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,760
solution out of there

475
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,600
we see this the time

476
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,519
if you look at outlook which has

477
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,680
replaced various versions of outlook and

478
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,519
other mail servers as well is that

479
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,920
you've still got hangovers from

480
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,199
when mail was

481
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,120
open port which everyone else i'm going

482
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,720
to say 25 and someone would call me out

483
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,480
on it

484
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,560
and then you say yeah hello

485
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,639
and then you you you could type it on

486
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,399
the command line you still got hangovers

487
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,639
from that in there the solution hasn't

488
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,240
changed but i've still got a nice shiny

489
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,040
interface and i can do this on a 365 and

490
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,839
um it's all

491
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,360
cloud-based but the system has a will to

492
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,800
live

493
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,399
and what that means is that there's no

494
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,639
there's no new new new thing

495
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,560
um it still has hangovers if you look at

496
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,800
the if you design a new solution

497
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,240
is that part of the process and the way

498
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,360
that it's worked and the look and the

499
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,920
feel will still be looking a bit like it

500
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,000
was previously or the

501
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,759
your requirements set will be based on

502
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,440
what you had previously

503
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,199
um

504
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,279
and that really puts you into quite the

505
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,600
pickle

506
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,959
and the other point of that as well is

507
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,279
that you end up with the new is that now

508
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,279
you've got something entirely untested

509
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,120
um and so you spent all this time having

510
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,160
a look at and tailoring and um closing

511
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,320
out some of these issues with uh with

512
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,680
previous versions now you've got a brand

513
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,199
new shiny thing

514
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,759
with a whole load of new unknowns except

515
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,240
for your design time documents

516
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,240
your you know

517
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,680
the source code you still don't know

518
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,600
how good it is until it's tested and

519
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,759
it's been embedded in so you know i work

520
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,079
in industry where we will never i'm sure

521
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,440
others do

522
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,600
never take version one of any anything

523
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,440
never take an early release of anything

524
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,880
and we sit back and we wait for other

525
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,279
people to do stuff and that leaves us

526
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,399
with a lag

527
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,920
on things

528
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,079
which has its own problems as well um

529
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,199
particularly in patching um whereas

530
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,600
get those zero days sorted out no we'll

531
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,759
we'll see it in it for six months um but

532
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,839
that requires going through a process of

533
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,000
assessing those and so you get stuck in

534
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,880
this

535
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,320
um

536
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,759
waiting for someone else to see if it

537
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,680
breaks first but then is that the

538
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,079
assumption then that they are they have

539
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,839
cleaned and closed out everything that's

540
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,359
there we just look back at open ssl and

541
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,799
say well we have various versions of

542
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:07,919
that

543
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,919
and at no point did they catch that or

544
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,199
you know the other side of that is was

545
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,480
that put in there deliberately but that

546
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,880
is a uh that's a whole other whole other

547
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,199
talk that someone else is better than me

548
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,640
um

549
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,880
it's like the changing things for making

550
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,119
these changes is you you will go through

551
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,599
these kind of uder type loops or

552
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,640
um

553
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,039
this kind of cycle of observe

554
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,760
orientate the side act someone else to

555
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,840
do it this is not an academic tool

556
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,360
and so i wouldn't recommend uder as a

557
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,360
thing but it's just a it's going through

558
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,039
this of what are you changing what is

559
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,559
the impact of that

560
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,080
um

561
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,080
one of the biggest

562
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,799
issues with with that is that the

563
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,320
by changing one thing you don't know

564
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,000
what the outcome of that will be and

565
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,840
we're back to this issue with our models

566
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,960
previously

567
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,000
is i can

568
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,679
make a good assumption on what i think

569
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,200
this impact is going to be until you're

570
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,799
at two o'clock in the morning trying to

571
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,520
rip stuff out or patch it or make a

572
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,039
decision to roll back

573
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,000
and uh

574
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,760
of a project that's taken six months in

575
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,520
planning

576
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,440
it's an unpleasant experience but

577
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,960
sometimes you don't know until that's

578
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,440
put in and tested

579
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,559
i didn't set my timer so i'm going off

580
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,720
my clock on my machine so i'm getting

581
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,160
all the excitement

582
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,440
um

583
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,440
so i think i'm good for time i'm sure

584
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,520
someone told me if i'm not

585
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,480
um

586
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,679
so this brings

587
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:28,880
onto

588
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,160
uh

589
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,919
right towards the end of this at the

590
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,440
moment but i wanted to go back on a

591
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,960
couple of items and one of these is that

592
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,640
the the

593
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,679
safety uh which is the the slide that i

594
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,039
stole this off

595
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,039
is an emergent property

596
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,799
um

597
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,320
and by safety also means security as

598
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,720
well as encompassing that and

599
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,280
we're talking about safety and security

600
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,120
and that the fact that the system works

601
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,120
we can kind of all encompass these in a

602
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,880
phrase called correctness

603
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,360
so this is does it work how you want it

604
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,480
to work

605
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,000
and so sometimes that means safety

606
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,440
sometimes it makes security sometimes it

607
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,280
means that i press the button and then a

608
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,960
meeting room is booked or something

609
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,880
similar

610
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,400
they're all the same thing

611
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,919
obviously from our point of view and

612
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,000
we're very precious his security is

613
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,360
absolute king

614
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,240
um but really look at this

615
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,320
a system and its correctness in its

616
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,440
operation

617
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,000
is the target that we're going for um

618
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,520
i'm trying desperately not to use the

619
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,039
you know move security to the left or

620
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,840
bake it in from the start but

621
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,600
right at the start is we need the system

622
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,880
to work

623
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,480
and if the system's work also includes

624
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,400
we need the system to work and that

625
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,640
includes security then it's already

626
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,160
there at that point and we're not doing

627
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,679
last minute charlie

628
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,960
um these code reviews just for a push

629
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,120
and sort of getting involved in the

630
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,679
sprint planning when we're on we're on

631
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,080
uh yeah some cycle six or seven when we

632
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,000
should have been there at the start

633
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,360
um

634
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,200
and the other part of that is a bleeding

635
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,559
on about

636
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,799
how security is just simply the system

637
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,320
working well

638
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,679
is this this concept of being an

639
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,760
emergent property is that it doesn't

640
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,360
mean that i put in

641
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,480
a new box when you upgrade the firewall

642
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,320
and security is done

643
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,600
um it's a combination of culmination of

644
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,440
things that are there so

645
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,039
are you doing

646
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,280
input checking on forms

647
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,880
is the right information in there that's

648
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,559
correctness of the solution

649
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,720
um is the invisible getting from

650
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,880
external sources correct as well are we

651
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,039
processing that well

652
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,840
are we outputting that

653
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,840
well um

654
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,360
and i'm trying to avoid saying the word

655
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,200
securely because what i just mean is

656
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,640
that it works

657
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,600
um which sounds very fundamental

658
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,840
and what i'm trying to desperately avoid

659
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,919
is making security this the special

660
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,679
thing i'm very aware of the audience

661
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,360
when i say that security is not a

662
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,799
special thing it should not be a special

663
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:53,840
thing in the same way that safety

664
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,039
shouldn't be a special thing if you look

665
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:55,919
into

666
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,760
uh you know a plant room

667
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,440
in a factory floor

668
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,559
it should be

669
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,640
safe and there should be measures in

670
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,240
there to prevent me from doing stupid

671
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,679
things but also including that as

672
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,039
processes to prevent me from doing

673
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:11,520
stupid things and maybe a um ppe or

674
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,000
an escort to stop me from doing that

675
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,799
and we would take that for granted

676
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,559
um until there's an accident and

677
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:19,919
security should be exactly the same

678
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,400
there should be those processes in place

679
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,640
to stop me from doing that to educate

680
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,520
better

681
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,720
um

682
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,240
and they should be

683
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,960
subtle and in the background without

684
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,280
uh having to do what we do now which is

685
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,880
just jumping up and down until we have

686
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,760
budget and time and resource to be able

687
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,200
to do these things

688
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,159
um

689
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,919
i'm very aware of preaching to the

690
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,200
converted

691
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,799
um it'd be nice to have these

692
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,480
conversations with uh with the with the

693
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,360
grown-ups in companies as well

694
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,240
uh so the idea is that this is

695
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,720
not something that is special

696
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,000
um

697
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,760
we kind of lose some of the luster and

698
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,400
the

699
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,679
badge of honor when we do that when we

700
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,360
just we just part of the furniture but

701
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,240
that's

702
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,840
i promise you that's exactly where we

703
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,600
want to be and just the thing that

704
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,679
happens and same with it that the system

705
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,520
working does

706
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,679
um

707
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,840
just

708
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,240
guessing on time because i think i'm 21

709
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,960
minutes in but i may not be

710
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,960
um that does

711
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,000
uh

712
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,760
leave a little bit of time for questions

713
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,880
as well

714
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,200
i think in my my early morning eagerness

715
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,960
and nervousness i've blasted through

716
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,240
faster than i expected

717
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,120
that's great absolutely great um

718
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,559
you're actually running only a few

719
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,080
minutes early so don't worry too much

720
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,200
about that

721
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,960
we've had plenty of comments

722
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,600
and appreciation for you via talk with

723
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,559
him

724
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,080
so i don't believe there are any

725
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,360
questions any questions kicking around

726
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,440
in there i haven't seen but some just

727
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,919
really positive comments about um you

728
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,080
know the state of affairs and um

729
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,520
basically you know um that the

730
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,400
philosophy of safety and the

731
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,640
philosophies of security are you know

732
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,280
almost sometimes diametrically opposed

733
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,840
um and and your contention that they

734
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,840
really need to be more aligned and we

735
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,240
need to have that philosophical i think

736
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,440
um uh alignment is is like a really

737
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,200
great thing and i really enjoyed the

738
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,159
presentation man um excellent insight

739
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,200
into the conditions that that are out

740
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,840
there in terms of like relationships and

741
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,919
and how it all comes together yeah

742
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,600
really great stuff yeah i agree

743
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,799
