00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,750
hello everyone I'm chilly from Tsinghua

2
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:16,640
University thank you for joining the

3
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:19,310
presentation my talk today is about

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,150
carbon diversity and it is a

5
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:24,740
collaboration work from university of

6
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:27,349
chinese academy of science and Tsinghua

7
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:29,330
University as you can see I'm not in the

8
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:34,070
author list but I will try my best to

9
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:36,620
share the work with you click on view I

10
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:38,750
see it's designed for a structured

11
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:41,209
interview though these archivo system

12
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:43,909
aims to search similar data from the

13
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:46,280
database however traditional system

14
00:00:43,909 --> 00:00:49,820
suffer from the issues of inaccuracy and

15
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:53,449
the power infinity therefore we propose

16
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:55,339
the cognitive SSD which integrates deep

17
00:00:53,449 --> 00:00:57,710
learning and graph search to provide

18
00:00:55,339 --> 00:00:59,960
potential performance and the language

19
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:03,650
leverage new data processing technique

20
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:06,950
to address power infinity issue in

21
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:08,840
summary university provides an energy

22
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:12,740
efficient and in storage a structured

23
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:14,680
interview solution this tower contains

24
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:19,729
four parts first I will introduce

25
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:22,880
background and motivation our system is

26
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:25,250
the design for a structured data which

27
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,699
can not be direct directly recognized by

28
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:32,000
the computer more importantly in helena

29
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:34,490
IBM reports indicated the structured

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,920
data has grown his prosody and occupiers

31
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,020
to 80% of storage capacity in data

32
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:42,320
centers and this is how we generate

33
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:45,350
intensive which he would quest before it

34
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,600
it is critical to support fast and

35
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:49,969
energy-efficient did have zero in the

36
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,079
cloud infrastructure to reduce the total

37
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:53,079
cost ordinal centers

38
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:58,490
however traditional diesel fuel systems

39
00:01:55,729 --> 00:02:01,369
suffer from the issues or inaccuracy

40
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:03,408
power infinity and the high cost from

41
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:06,530
the software perspective the current

42
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:09,200
obstacle in Lenexa system that design

43
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:11,510
for hard disk drive were significantly

44
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:15,950
burdens the retrieval system especially

45
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:17,810
after using the high-end storage for

46
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:20,690
example the legacy of our stock EKOS

47
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:23,650
done fry space SSD and infirm times

48
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,650
obtain SSD

49
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:29,100
meanwhile from the hardware perspective

50
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:31,370
the desire to the low level storage must

51
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:34,019
travel cross or slow our interface

52
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:36,090
memory and cache is before reaching the

53
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:39,990
computer you knees this will incur

54
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:41,370
energy and the latency over hide the

55
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:44,340
content based a structured interview

56
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:46,530
system contains two stages feature I've

57
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:49,380
had any representation and database in

58
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,420
taxing coverage traditional feature

59
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,700
representation the database in text

60
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,920
message cannot provide accurate receiver

61
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,299
performance

62
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,940
therefore we leverage the deeper in the

63
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:02,670
temptation and the search to provide her

64
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:06,930
feature representation and perform fast

65
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:08,549
and the high across is retrieval to

66
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,100
address the above software and hardware

67
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:13,080
issues first we'll combine the dimension

68
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:16,140
and the graph search to perform better

69
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,980
accuracy in vivo and integrate them into

70
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:23,549
the TRG accelerator to simplify the

71
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:26,000
software stack meanwhile for fully using

72
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:28,860
the internal bandwidth to SSD and

73
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,780
address the long data moment pass

74
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:34,050
problem we allow reach nearly a

75
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:36,150
precision techniques to put a DX into

76
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:40,800
the SSD to construct the common divisor

77
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:43,590
see in this manner the TRG acts club

78
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:46,790
obtain data directly from flash by past

79
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:49,020
conventional memory hierarchy

80
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:51,929
meanwhile we also provide a user to

81
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:55,110
visible software abstraction to improve

82
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:57,950
the scalability of the colony haven't

83
00:03:55,110 --> 00:04:03,300
devised the system to support different

84
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:03,859
applications next I will explain how to

85
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:08,760
deploy

86
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:11,100
cousin invited system the cocoon evil as

87
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,230
ID system contains two parts the DRG

88
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:16,108
library running on the user level space

89
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:17,969
a user is responsible for controlling

90
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:23,400
and communicating to the Kotton inverse

91
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:25,730
D based on the Mme protocol we provide

92
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:29,460
the configuration command the DRG config

93
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:31,770
to configure the DRG acceleration that

94
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,979
has a command such as the logic machine

95
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:37,710
to generate the hash code of input data

96
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:40,229
the node command such as as as you read

97
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:44,219
could access the physical address of the

98
00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:46,378
current device SD the firmware and the

99
00:04:44,219 --> 00:04:48,270
had a viral colony of ICD receives and

100
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:50,460
the process these requests from the AG

101
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:52,349
library where the colony versity

102
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:57,359
communicates to the hosted server by the

103
00:04:52,349 --> 00:04:59,339
PCIe interface as a mission above connie

104
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,649
west the combines the deep learning and

105
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:03,689
the graph such technique therefore two

106
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:06,569
issues need to be addressed in the LC

107
00:05:03,689 --> 00:05:08,219
library first how to update the deep

108
00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:11,129
learning model and the graph parameter

109
00:05:08,219 --> 00:05:14,159
to address this problem we provide the

110
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:16,139
PIO GX comparator that suppose the

111
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:18,509
peroneal framework to transfer the deep

112
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:20,580
learning model into the instructions of

113
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:25,289
the Ajax and the general graph

114
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:27,330
parameters after diet

115
00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:29,339
users can invoke meant to read these

116
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:33,959
instructions and the parameters into the

117
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:36,209
kikuna SSD the second challenge is how

118
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:38,639
to dispatch request to address this

119
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:39,449
problem we construct the task pane to

120
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,759
standard Christ

121
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:44,339
meanwhile the task plane also provides

122
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,529
the user-defined API interface to enable

123
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:50,459
users to deploy other applications

124
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:52,919
without much modification this API could

125
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:55,050
be configured to read read the results

126
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:57,508
or any module the colony current versus

127
00:05:55,050 --> 00:06:01,979
D system according to the instruction

128
00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:04,830
and user configuration mean we also

129
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:06,959
pride data plane to enable users to

130
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:11,969
access the physical address of the Cavan

131
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:14,339
advice T the firmware or chronovisor

132
00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:17,879
diamond is the request from the DRG

133
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:19,379
library first the DRG configurator

134
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:21,649
receives command and the read

135
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:23,849
instructions and the parameters into the

136
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:29,369
instruction and the parameter array of

137
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:31,740
nano flies second the dispatcher push

138
00:06:29,369 --> 00:06:36,889
requests into the queue and the issued

139
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:39,930
command to the accelerator third the

140
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:42,509
scheduler is responsible for issuing out

141
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:46,560
requests to the geology the salary or

142
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:48,300
the nano Faraj controller afterwards

143
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,080
introduced in the cotton diversity

144
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:55,230
system I will introduce details or the

145
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:57,780
accelerator first traditional deep

146
00:06:55,230 --> 00:07:00,990
learning sorry to obtains metadata from

147
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:03,299
the DRM although as I said we also have

148
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:05,820
a compact pyramid to cache data metadata

149
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,650
the internal theorem capacity can hardly

150
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:11,340
satisfy the numerous neural network

151
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:13,710
parameters therefore we expose NAND

152
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:16,469
flash controller to the drg accelerator

153
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:18,690
which enables the TRX to read the

154
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:22,320
related data from then flies by pasta in

155
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:25,590
turn oh dear I'm remember we also proved

156
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:29,700
that the band waste of flesh exceeds the

157
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:32,280
demand of convolution layer for fully

158
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:34,080
connecting the layer we only use the one

159
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,599
column LP are ready to punish the

160
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:41,490
bandwidth of the volunteer and event

161
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:43,920
flourish due to the net flash controller

162
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:45,570
to read data in parallel the tittle me

163
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,000
out our NAND flash will impact the

164
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:50,270
performance of a data transmission

165
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,920
especially for the fully connected layer

166
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:54,930
therefore to address this problem first

167
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:57,510
we split a deeper learning parameters

168
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:59,610
according to the number of channels used

169
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:04,380
by the TRX to maximize the Paradiso

170
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:06,690
movement flash second we leverage the

171
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,900
new demands the command pod provided by

172
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:09,510
the

173
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:15,299
non-flush manufacturer to improve the

174
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:17,610
throughput or nine flies after

175
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,470
introducing the deep learning partner

176
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:21,360
with the Dax I will explain how to

177
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:24,570
achieve a graph search on the objects

178
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,460
first the graph search stage is similar

179
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:28,560
to the deeper learning algorithm and a

180
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:32,520
link in the contains an online strange

181
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:35,370
and offline stage in the analyzed you

182
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:37,890
know offline stage the TRG acts memory

183
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:41,310
uses TX to generate a hash code to

184
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:45,439
construct a directed Kaden graph in the

185
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:48,630
king graph what X represents data entry

186
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,300
over the diet in the online stage the

187
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:54,180
TRX generates the feature of users data

188
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:56,250
and map it to the king graph then based

189
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:58,530
on the concept out the neighbor of the

190
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:01,680
neighbor is also latitude is also likely

191
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:04,209
to be a neighbor the DRG the DRG acts

192
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,368
sorry

193
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:11,079
the de-iced has the vertex of kingcraft

194
00:09:07,369 --> 00:09:14,149
find the true neighbors or the user data

195
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:16,910
however in that flash video machines are

196
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:19,160
performed at a pitch granularity so that

197
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:21,949
every time that the arjax accesses the

198
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:26,540
neighbors of value attacks it must read

199
00:09:21,949 --> 00:09:28,368
a page from flash this one cause low

200
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:30,319
bandwidth utilize utilization if we

201
00:09:28,369 --> 00:09:34,399
place warthogs and their neighbors in

202
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:36,170
flash memory sequentially to address

203
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,989
this problem we we can infer that

204
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:40,639
neighbors of the access the waters will

205
00:09:38,989 --> 00:09:43,939
be used to Siouxland due to the spatial

206
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:45,739
locality before the neighbors overtax

207
00:09:43,939 --> 00:09:48,469
and neighbors neighbor are aligned under

208
00:09:45,739 --> 00:09:51,019
start from the beginning of a page as a

209
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:54,379
result such a layer with redundancy can

210
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:59,480
reduce the flash access compared to the

211
00:09:54,379 --> 00:10:01,790
non optimized graph layout we use the

212
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:04,429
image retrieval system as a showcase to

213
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:08,179
explain how to deploy the crown

214
00:10:04,429 --> 00:10:10,519
diversity system first we inject image

215
00:10:08,179 --> 00:10:12,829
the it her second deployed people in the

216
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:16,009
only model and the graph so the crimini

217
00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:19,819
current system could receive Christ from

218
00:10:16,009 --> 00:10:22,160
in tonight for the first type the users

219
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:25,549
invoking a pie of a data plane to inject

220
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:28,339
image data into the ninth flies second

221
00:10:25,549 --> 00:10:30,889
use the library leverage the tip

222
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:34,249
learning framework to training model for

223
00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:35,899
image database after that user uses the

224
00:10:34,249 --> 00:10:39,049
arch compiler to generate instructions

225
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:43,970
and graphic parameters and rhythm into

226
00:10:39,049 --> 00:10:45,920
the ninth flies finally when kakuni

227
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:48,559
current devices the system receives a

228
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:52,009
request the task plane will send this

229
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:54,110
request to the passive scheduler when

230
00:10:52,009 --> 00:10:56,240
the ax receives command the deep

231
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:58,819
learning unit generates the hash code of

232
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,480
user data and the graphs of Union such

233
00:10:58,819 --> 00:11:04,549
unity search searches in stimulate data

234
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:08,679
and then transfers the the ID directly

235
00:11:04,549 --> 00:11:08,679
there is also storing NAND flash to

236
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,440
the tax plane will stand this we cut

237
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,840
into the task scheduler when the algae

238
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,400
is receives command the different unit

239
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:29,010
is Janosch the Hodge code or user data

240
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:31,800
and a graph search unit slush is

241
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:34,170
simulated engine transfers the Arditi

242
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:37,490
rock results taurine and flash to the

243
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:40,229
host server by using the PCIe interface

244
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:44,400
finally I've introduced the evaluation

245
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:47,460
part first we build a colony cognitive

246
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:50,340
SSD based on the opacity platform which

247
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:53,670
includes incavilgia chip when capacity

248
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:56,790
Ram it channels nine flies it's night on

249
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:58,380
the PCIe interface the DRG accelerator

250
00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:01,920
and the NAND flash controller and

251
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:05,280
implanted on the rigid sheep and from

252
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:08,130
while running on the processor a pigeon

253
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:10,530
ship remember we also built for

254
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:15,060
baselines to show the performance of the

255
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:17,819
current device D and we select we select

256
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:22,380
the content-based image retrieval system

257
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:24,750
as workload we leverage four different

258
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:26,700
scale criticized to evaluate the

259
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:29,550
performance of the hashing and graph

260
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:32,460
searched a prism the results indicate

261
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:34,410
that our theology solution performance

262
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,630
by retrieval accuracy

263
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:37,920
regardless of the choice of the p-value

264
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:42,900
when compared to the commercial

265
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:45,089
solutions it also shows the robustness

266
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:49,860
of the drg solution when to ride on a

267
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:51,450
real world system mean we will compare

268
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:53,370
the latency and the proverb the

269
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:56,370
depression unit and graph search unit

270
00:12:53,370 --> 00:13:02,030
and the objects salary to the solutions

271
00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:04,410
based on the CPU and GPU the results

272
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:07,790
indicated that the depression unit of

273
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:10,469
the TRX art from Scipio solutions

274
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:13,349
perpetuate to the officials resource and

275
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:15,930
frequency limit is a limitation the

276
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:18,540
latency of the th acts in higher than

277
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:23,579
GPU well that GPUs consumes more power

278
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:25,709
than the OGX memory also means that the

279
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:29,209
the graph search unit of the Ajax art

280
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:32,699
from CPU solution

281
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:34,819
we built a web of sensible CBR system to

282
00:13:32,699 --> 00:13:37,560
evaluate the latency of the system and

283
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:40,110
utilize the metrics of a comparison per

284
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:43,920
watt to evaluate a power efficiency of

285
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:45,920
the system the results indicate that the

286
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,389
revenue USD could reduce latency by

287
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,610
sixty nine point nine percent on average

288
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:53,310
compared to the CPU solutions and more

289
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:59,579
power efficient and the GPO based system

290
00:13:53,310 --> 00:14:02,489
by two point four times the cognitive is

291
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:04,109
the unconventional cluster system only

292
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:07,279
occupies fourteen point zero eight

293
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:10,110
percent power consumption of the system

294
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,699
mean well considering the 20 messages

295
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:14,069
you can change the ARM processor that

296
00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:17,459
could run the Lando system and has a

297
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:20,490
lower power consumption compared to the

298
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:22,380
Intel CPU dear well we propose a host

299
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:24,630
free cluster system where the colony

300
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:30,180
versus the other server compress the

301
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:31,949
banner users request independently the

302
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:34,769
results indicated when system

303
00:14:31,949 --> 00:14:37,219
concurrency is low the host free cluster

304
00:14:34,769 --> 00:14:39,810
system delivers better power efficiency

305
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:41,639
the reason is that using high

306
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:42,449
performance machines to handle if

307
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:45,959
frequent requests

308
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:47,910
result in low energy efficiency the host

309
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:50,219
of free classes the carceral system will

310
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:52,680
be more powerful power efficient if the

311
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:55,199
cortex a9 processor is reprised

312
00:14:52,680 --> 00:15:00,630
replaced by the latest latest collision

313
00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:03,750
series of precise ER in summary we build

314
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:05,310
a common identity that prize a more

315
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:07,920
power efficient solution for

316
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:10,109
unstructured data in civil first the

317
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,829
internal energy acts Observatory

318
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,329
increased

319
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:14,819
deeper learning and the graph search to

320
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:17,760
provide the potential performance second

321
00:15:14,819 --> 00:15:19,740
the objects directly access the data

322
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:23,339
from nine flights bypassed memory

323
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:25,889
hierarchy finally our refugees base the

324
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:29,449
prototype indicates that Connie was out

325
00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:32,370
from other solutions on power efficiency

326
00:15:29,449 --> 00:15:34,380
so some scheme for reasoning and the

327
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:36,540
system not familiar with the details of

328
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:38,519
the work if you have any questions you

329
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:41,000
can contact the directly

330
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:41,000
thank you

331
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:46,219
