1
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,650
I'll be presenting our study of the

2
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:17,290
design and operation of cloud lab like I

3
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:19,119
mentioned the lightning talk this is the

4
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:23,970
study run by the same group of people

5
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,970
who designed it built it and operated

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:30,939
what is cloud lab again back to the set

7
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:32,558
in the context it's a testbed for it's a

8
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:35,080
distributed testbed for research in

9
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:37,209
cloud computing and distributed systems

10
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:39,129
the hardware is deployed across three

11
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:42,940
sites University of Utah University of

12
00:00:39,129 --> 00:00:45,879
Wisconsin and Clemson University and the

13
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:47,620
experiments run on physical machines

14
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:52,150
physical Hardware as opposed to virtual

15
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:55,870
machines here there are over 4,000 users

16
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:59,920
using the testbed from different US

17
00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:02,080
institutions and overall it's a plate

18
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,879
it's a place where experimenters use the

19
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,470
hardware to build the software

20
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:08,020
environments of their choice whether

21
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:11,560
it's cloud computing or any other flavor

22
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:13,720
of distributed computing and the way we

23
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,939
like to look at it as a laboratory or

24
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:18,579
facility to study in those types of

25
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:23,559
systems rather than an individual system

26
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:27,038
of that type back to the map of the

27
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:29,829
hardware resources each site in cloud

28
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:31,960
lab has its own focus and set of

29
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:35,380
features it provides yeah it's got

30
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:37,329
unique set of hardware available overall

31
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:39,969
there are 19 different Hardware types

32
00:01:37,329 --> 00:01:42,399
available and you can learn more about

33
00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:44,020
them if you go to cloud lab us there's a

34
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:48,490
hardware page with all the hardware

35
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:50,679
specifications so cloud lab was built to

36
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:53,979
support cloud computing and distributed

37
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:56,439
systems research and it's an interesting

38
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:59,649
topic to see how that mission translates

39
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:02,919
into published work and here we looked

40
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:06,939
at recently published papers we did a

41
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:09,970
survey of almost hundred papers and we

42
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:12,790
see that research on networking and

43
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:15,370
security aspects of these systems add up

44
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:18,100
almost to 50 percent of the research use

45
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:20,620
of cloud lab and in this long tail

46
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:23,769
distribution we see that users use

47
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,990
low-level access to the hardware they

48
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,550
will

49
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:28,160
for specific features the hardware

50
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:30,290
provides and also they take advantage of

51
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:34,880
the strong isolation performance

52
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:37,010
isolation here's why we study cloud lab

53
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,500
we would like to better understand how

54
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:42,730
well it serves the needs of the research

55
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:45,140
community we like to would like to

56
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:48,140
analyze the impact of the design and

57
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:50,750
implementation decisions and reveal the

58
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:53,959
associated trade-offs but would also

59
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:56,420
like to generalize the lessons that we

60
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,830
learn and make them relevant to the

61
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:00,049
design of other test beds and

62
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:06,500
infrastructure of the service facilities

63
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:10,100
a couple of examples here showing what

64
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:13,280
kind of research requests the facility

65
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:16,250
can serve so one user can ask for

66
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,490
several servers immediately another

67
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:22,190
person can come in and ask for machines

68
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:24,110
of certain with certain features there

69
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:28,579
are some requests with specific

70
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:31,100
networking requirements and also more on

71
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:34,220
the demanding side user can come in and

72
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:37,130
ask for a large set of machines when

73
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:40,310
they become available and cloud lab

74
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:44,510
tries to meet these fulfill these needs

75
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:49,670
in terms of scale time and features it

76
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:52,040
also tries to guide users to to help

77
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:54,589
them choose feasible configurations for

78
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,989
their experiments and also if something

79
00:03:54,590 --> 00:04:00,860
goes wrong the facility needs to provide

80
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:03,680
meaningful and actionable feedback in

81
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:06,830
this study we question these question

82
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,350
these goals in trying to understand like

83
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:12,200
weather cloud lab fulfills these goals

84
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:14,120
or not how it can accomplish them and

85
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:18,079
also try to generalize the lessons that

86
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:20,899
we learn in this analysis we just saw

87
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,870
this list with which is sort of the user

88
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:26,810
perspective and in this study we dive

89
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:28,880
into analysis of these components that

90
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:31,220
are responsible for helping with these

91
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,780
goals we have reservation system have

92
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,770
constrained system and we have error

93
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,770
reporting system

94
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,360
all right we're going to look at the

95
00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:43,729
reservation system and to better set the

96
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,440
context for this analysis is we need to

97
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:48,530
go back and look at the historic data

98
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:52,610
this is sort of the measure before you

99
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:54,799
build reference to Ramsey's key node so

100
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:57,800
what can we learn from the historic

101
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,229
usage data we've captured a number of

102
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,990
metrics related to the growth and usage

103
00:05:00,229 --> 00:05:05,568
of the facility we have number of we

104
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:10,150
have the number of servers growing over

105
00:05:05,569 --> 00:05:12,020
time we have an increasing user activity

106
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:15,859
represented by the number of active

107
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:18,590
users every month we have a growing

108
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:21,199
number of projects and we also have the

109
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:23,690
node hours going up where node hours

110
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:27,110
captures how active how busy the

111
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:29,419
facility is and overall we can summarize

112
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:34,550
here that we have so far we have not

113
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:36,258
found a limit to this demand all right

114
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:41,330
we're going to go one level deeper here

115
00:05:36,259 --> 00:05:44,360
and look at this this second question is

116
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:46,930
there enough hardware for everyone so we

117
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,849
started this analysis by looking at

118
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:53,330
individual time plots time series plots

119
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:55,669
for different Hardware types and we

120
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:58,250
started with this highly volatile plot

121
00:05:55,669 --> 00:06:02,469
on the left and we sort of derive this

122
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:04,520
more interpretable in kind of more

123
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:06,919
interesting curve on the right and

124
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,960
that's the number percent of the time

125
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:10,669
available as a function of percent of

126
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,580
the notes we're in the left top corner

127
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:15,590
we have one machine that is available

128
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:17,900
almost hundred percent of the time in

129
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:19,909
the right bottom corner we have the

130
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,169
opposite hundred machines are almost 100

131
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:24,110
percent of the machines aren't almost

132
00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:26,780
never available and we have a nice curve

133
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:28,280
between the two plots we repeat this for

134
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:30,530
different Hardware types and we get this

135
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:34,789
nice spectrum of different availability

136
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:36,820
curves one of these points here indicate

137
00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:39,380
that for this particular hardware type

138
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:41,030
200 machines are available 80% of the

139
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:43,909
time and that's that's really nice that

140
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:47,239
that allows for large experiments on the

141
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:49,310
other hand for the hardware time

142
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:53,870
hardware type that is

143
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:56,300
used we only can get 50% 50 machines for

144
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:59,570
30% of the time and that's not so great

145
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:01,490
but that's still it's still reasonable

146
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:03,920
but for this case we would like to

147
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:05,120
really use reservations so those users

148
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,340
who are interested in the features that

149
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,490
that hardware provides they should

150
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:12,500
submit their reservation requests and

151
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:14,330
here I have a slide really just one

152
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,970
slide described in the design of the

153
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:20,150
reservation system so it all starts

154
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:23,030
but these requests follow in a

155
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:24,979
particular format where a user needs to

156
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:28,250
specify how many machines he or she

157
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:29,690
needs the specific type in the interval

158
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:34,520
of time when the hardware is going to be

159
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:37,490
used so the accounting on the cloud lab

160
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:40,820
side is done per project and on the per

161
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:43,070
hardware basis these requests are

162
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:44,900
subject to validation checks where users

163
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:47,090
can check if it's feasible or not

164
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:50,380
according to the current schedule before

165
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:54,739
they commit to one of these and also

166
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:59,630
this is the the reservation system is

167
00:07:54,740 --> 00:08:01,130
built in a way that it so the

168
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:02,750
experiments are not launched

169
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:04,820
automatically according to these

170
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:06,530
reservations it's up to the users to

171
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:08,719
come in again at that time and launch

172
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:10,640
their experiments so this can be

173
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,520
compared to hotel reservation system

174
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:15,800
where Hotel doesn't check you in in the

175
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,140
room when you give them a call and ask

176
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:21,440
for a room it happens when you arrive at

177
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:23,719
the hotel same thing here user submits

178
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,790
an advance reservation plans the usage

179
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:29,740
and then at the time when the time comes

180
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:32,860
then he or she launches the experiments

181
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:37,220
so how well does this work in practice

182
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:40,190
so this reservation system came into

183
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:41,960
production in at the end of 2017 and

184
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:46,250
we've been gathering information about

185
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:49,040
its usage so we can do immediately is

186
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:51,650
look at the sizes and durations of

187
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,110
experiments compared to the sizes and

188
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:58,329
durations of approved reservations this

189
00:08:54,110 --> 00:09:01,670
plot at the bottom so something about

190
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:02,610
reasoning here relates to Ramsey's talk

191
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:04,229
again it's

192
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,670
about careful measurement and careful

193
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,529
reasoning for these types of

194
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:10,380
distributions we can't just compare

195
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:12,510
averages we need to look deeper and

196
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,730
compare certain percentiles because

197
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:17,790
these are long tailed distributions for

198
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:19,320
both of the dimensions so we do that in

199
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:22,529
the paper and we look at things like

200
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:25,800
medians and 95th percentile so we can

201
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:27,990
see quite difference between the 95th

202
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,390
percentile for experiments and 95th

203
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:34,459
percentile for reservations with respect

204
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:37,199
to the duration same happens for the

205
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:40,920
number of notes and other percentiles

206
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:43,410
we've analyzed and here's our summary

207
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,569
for that reservations allow users to run

208
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:49,140
longer and larger experiments that's

209
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:51,649
what our analysis confirms we'll also

210
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:56,819
look at the time line when the active

211
00:09:51,649 --> 00:10:00,450
when the reservation system is very

212
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:02,670
active when it's mostly used in the

213
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:06,120
increased activity there aligns well

214
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:08,189
with the overall high utilization of the

215
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:12,240
testbed which which which makes sense

216
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:15,230
it's a very intuitive summary when the

217
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,579
hardware is busy people sort of

218
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:19,649
participated in the competition for the

219
00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:23,189
resources and they can they can address

220
00:10:19,649 --> 00:10:24,089
it by using the reservation system this

221
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,390
slide here

222
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:28,829
talk kind of gives us information about

223
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:30,810
reservations allowing users to meet

224
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:33,170
their deadlines and the spikes here

225
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:35,399
correspond to increased activity around

226
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:37,640
conference deadlines in the spring and

227
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:37,640
in the fall

228
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:42,600
all right we're switching gears here

229
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:44,779
we'll talk about errors and for this

230
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:48,510
discussion it's important to note that

231
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:52,140
errors come from the resource mapping

232
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:54,390
face of the process it's a complex

233
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:58,230
process where there are a lot of

234
00:10:54,390 --> 00:11:00,180
potential scenarios and outcomes and the

235
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:02,180
system needs to be clear about what's

236
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:04,589
going on and communicated to the users

237
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:07,199
generally speaking resource mapping can

238
00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:09,870
be solved through one of these

239
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:12,630
approaches so general algorithm would

240
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:15,850
make very few assumptions about the

241
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:17,710
facility and really solve this problem

242
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:21,820
as a constraint satisfaction and

243
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:25,630
optimization problem on more specialized

244
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:27,400
and we can design a more custom and more

245
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:29,380
tailored solution that has more

246
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:31,750
knowledge about the facility and can be

247
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:35,680
very particular about its process and

248
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:37,780
its outcomes so cloud lab takes a hybrid

249
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,270
approach where there's a general part

250
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:42,610
and more specialized part so the general

251
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:44,949
part is is what solves the simulated

252
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:47,710
annealing problem for solving graph is a

253
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:49,470
morphism problem and on top of that

254
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:52,060
serve as a wrapper we have a set of

255
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:56,740
deterministic heuristics that help

256
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:58,810
improve the feedback so this is what

257
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:02,230
comes out of this process these are the

258
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:04,989
errors that weave the system recorded

259
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:07,600
and we've analyzed we have top ten

260
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:09,880
errors produced by cloud lab and their

261
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,910
frequencies on the right and the column

262
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:15,010
called helpful is really just our own

263
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:18,010
assessment of whether they were helpful

264
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:19,990
and actionable or not and even though

265
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:22,150
there's some room for improvement mostly

266
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:25,570
this error messages are are poor or

267
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:27,120
helpful we summarized it here with the

268
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:29,890
following statement so we've identified

269
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,560
the common error scenarios and address

270
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:35,199
them through the custom heuristics these

271
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:38,189
numbers add up to about 86 percent of

272
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:42,780
the last year's errors that we found

273
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:42,780
interpretable and actionable

274
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:47,079
all right we're switching gears again

275
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:51,190
and now looking at the constraint system

276
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:55,780
and there's the main question here is

277
00:12:51,190 --> 00:13:01,330
that do constraints help avoid some of

278
00:12:55,780 --> 00:13:04,270
those errors so it's it it's good to set

279
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:06,610
the context here with an analogy we can

280
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:10,900
compare constraints against the error

281
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:13,120
reporting system where one is similar to

282
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:16,150
the feedback that you get from an IDE

283
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,790
and the report system error reporting

284
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:20,980
system can be compared to the feedback

285
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:23,290
that you get from the compiler in one

286
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:25,450
case you get like faster more

287
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:27,610
interactive feedback before you put in a

288
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:29,740
lot of work and then once once that's

289
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:31,690
done you can compile it or

290
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:34,210
in the case of cloud lab you push the

291
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:36,700
button and launch the instantiate the

292
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:40,840
experiment in that case you get more

293
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:43,420
definitive more concrete feedback but

294
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:45,310
you as a user obviously benefit from the

295
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:48,189
orderly feedback as well and that's what

296
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:50,199
the constraint system provides so behind

297
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:53,350
the scenes there is the valuation

298
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:55,540
procedure built around the boolean

299
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:57,490
product of sums I'm not going to go into

300
00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:01,510
details here you can check it out in the

301
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:05,340
paper I'll just mention the context in

302
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:08,380
which it's used so the constraints are

303
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:10,180
like show up in two places it's an

304
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:12,400
interactive topology design and cluster

305
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:14,260
selection those are steps in the

306
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:17,430
instantiation of your when you

307
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:20,800
instantiate your experiment on cloud lab

308
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:22,599
and we summarized here that the

309
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,790
constraint system running as a

310
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:27,640
lightweight system in front of the

311
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:30,280
complex and heavyweight mapper procedure

312
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:34,960
improves user experience and helps avoid

313
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:37,060
some of those errors in conclusion I'll

314
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:40,150
just mention that we in this study

315
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:42,310
analyzed three components in cloud labs

316
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:44,170
control framework the reservation system

317
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:47,319
the constraint system and error

318
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:49,870
reporting system and we have for each of

319
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:53,460
these components we have findings and

320
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:56,680
analysis that we present in the paper

321
00:14:53,460 --> 00:15:00,130
one more conclusion slide here so for

322
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:02,140
cloud lab that take that runs

323
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:05,380
reservation system constraint system and

324
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:07,420
error reporting system we we see that

325
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:11,170
the testbed satisfies diverse research

326
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:12,849
needs helps researchers find feasible

327
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:15,160
configurations and provides helpful

328
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:19,620
feedback and the paper presents the data

329
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:21,880
and analysis that back this statement

330
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:25,180
the data in the code that we worked with

331
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:27,730
are available at this URL you can see

332
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:31,030
from the numbers that it's quite a bit

333
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:33,010
of cloud labs history and what's

334
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:35,500
interesting about this repo is that

335
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:38,770
through the binder integration we made

336
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:40,150
it so that you can not only see the the

337
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:42,569
code but you can also run it with

338
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:44,730
minimal effort

339
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:47,400
more about cloud lab so this is my last

340
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:49,350
slide go to cloud lab dad you yes and

341
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,660
you can sign up for an account if you

342
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:52,620
haven't done so already and if you want

343
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,839
to learn more about it

344
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:58,980
join our birds of a feather session at

345
00:15:54,840 --> 00:16:06,960
7:30 tonight and that's all I've got

346
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:16,080
thank you for your attention few

347
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:20,610
questions from University of Washington

348
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:23,100
just curious how do you to promise

349
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:24,320
isolation in cloud lab especially in

350
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,610
networking

351
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,760
Palomas oscillations are there any

352
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:31,830
interesting observations right right so

353
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:34,380
there number always to look at that one

354
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:36,540
would be two so cloud lab offers a set

355
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:38,400
of programmable switches so you can get

356
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,990
your own machines connected to a

357
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,819
programmable switch and then you control

358
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:43,770
how it runs you control the software and

359
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:46,110
you know what what's what

360
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:51,410
what goes through that switch so that's

361
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:51,410
one of the strongest examples of that i

362
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:57,300
mean i'll mentioning it i guess so

363
00:16:55,290 --> 00:17:00,000
on the hardware so on the machine side

364
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:02,160
you also don't get other users you know

365
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,750
you don't see other users using the same

366
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,889
machines at the same time when you have

367
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,339
an experiment running on a machine

368
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:11,660
that's that's only you so it's

369
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:16,409
explicitly assigned to your experiment

370
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:20,010
hi great doc i I had a question about

371
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:22,020
reservations how so in case there are

372
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:23,819
multiple reservations for the same kind

373
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:26,250
of hardware and the quantity how is this

374
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:28,560
race condition result when there are

375
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:30,330
multiple reservations that are seeking

376
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,879
same kind of hardware at the same time

377
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:34,800
span

378
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:37,050
all right so there's a kind of overall

379
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:40,139
schedule for that hardware type right

380
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:41,669
and so when a reservation comes in the

381
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:43,560
details of the reservation that checked

382
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:46,200
against that schedule if it goes through

383
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:48,300
its accepted and kind of in the schedule

384
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,820
updated when another reservation comes

385
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:54,510
in then it in might not fit in and I

386
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:55,740
will be rejected first-come first-serve

387
00:17:54,510 --> 00:18:02,250
basis

388
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:04,410
for the reservations yes and not so if

389
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:06,720
you get multiple requests for an empty

390
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:08,490
like unassigned hardware at the same

391
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,440
time how do you decide which one to

392
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:12,510
which request would you assign based on

393
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,309
the time stamp I mean yeah in practice

394
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:16,050
that will never be exactly simultaneous

395
00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:18,570
right so though they'll have some

396
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:21,059
difference in time and also it depends

397
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:23,010
on the class or size of reservation

398
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:26,070
small reservations will be granted

399
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:27,809
automatically if if possible and longer

400
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:29,669
ones will be reviewed by the admins and

401
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:34,410
that's how the conflicts can be resolved

402
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:36,510
thank you so much I one more question

403
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:38,370
Thomas from tubing so what type of

404
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:42,150
metrics does your platform provide for

405
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:44,129
experiment run so what type of metrics

406
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:46,080
are are people who run experiments

407
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:49,170
interested in is like energy consumption

408
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:51,419
or network traffic so you can you can

409
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:53,280
collect and so measure and collect all

410
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,809
that yourself so we're on we don't

411
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,540
really do you I have to do that myself

412
00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:59,280
right we capture some lightweight like

413
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:01,649
CPU utilization metrics but that's

414
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,629
mostly for different reasons for

415
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:05,550
understanding if the experiment is

416
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:08,010
active or not and we can ask people to

417
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:10,800
release the resources if the ulation is

418
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:13,110
low but it's really up to you - yeah

419
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:15,780
like dive deep and capture all the

420
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:18,159
interesting metrics okay that's time

421
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:22,389
call speak again

422
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,390
[Applause]
