1
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,730
good morning everyone I'm Shane came

2
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,200
from Seoul National University and

3
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,230
Samsung Electronics

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,939
today I'm gonna talk about our practical

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,210
a suspension technique for modern

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:26,550
laura.and.steve SST we focus on the race

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,369
operation of NAND flash memory to leave

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,380
you sleeper latency

9
00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:33,840
this is joint work with my colleague at

10
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:37,710
Seoul National University Samsung and

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,260
Sony online University NAND flash race

12
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,629
SSD have become a de facto standard you

13
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:56,699
know data center environment allowing us

14
00:00:42,629 --> 00:01:01,319
superior circuit and Roberta latency as

15
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:03,960
well as a low price it is true that SSDs

16
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,170
can achieve very doable latency and

17
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:10,200
superior throughput but telltale latency

18
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,960
remain strong the figure demonstrates

19
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,720
this issue with Ali Allah latency SSD

20
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,509
the x-axis represents the percent

21
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:23,070
ability test and the y-axis represents

22
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:25,950
the rate I see with the logo scale the

23
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:28,859
low latency SSD using a Lobel latest in

24
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:32,130
hand and a controller shows shows where

25
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:35,158
drooly the average rate st which is 116

26
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:37,829
microsecond yet its tail latency of

27
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:41,520
pyronite percentile and uber is very

28
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:44,399
high in this paper hourly data latest

29
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,649
goal its top 200 micro second which is

30
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,429
comparative with the emerging ambient

31
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:49,429
based the SSD

32
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,359
there are a two significant source of

33
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,450
baloney detail latency garbage

34
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:58,770
collection and vlog laser operation

35
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:03,179
garbage collection gives the leader

36
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:06,390
latency user to exceed 100 millisecond

37
00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:08,670
but now thanks to many advances the

38
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:12,230
garbage collection technique treyton see

39
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:15,630
has decreased to 10 millisecond

40
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:18,420
therefore turn and fly garage operation

41
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:19,500
has become the dominant source of lead

42
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,589
here latency

43
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,840
generally NAND flash memory cannot

44
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:28,049
execute multiple command at the same

45
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,170
time so if the land is the original

46
00:02:28,049 --> 00:02:32,750
block or read recast

47
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:35,780
can that be processed until the edge

48
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:38,209
operation is completed to solve this

49
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:43,430
problem today the suspension scheme has

50
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:46,520
been devised now I'm gonna explain how

51
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:51,200
that the reader agency came vary

52
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:54,440
depending on the state of the net first

53
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:57,410
if if the land is either an incoming

54
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,780
lead will have a length and self such

55
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:02,450
microsecond

56
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:04,790
but in turn and raging flood to read

57
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:07,280
residency maybe over a 10 millisecond

58
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:10,010
because the read operation cannot be

59
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:14,989
performed until the current grade

60
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:18,320
operation is completed in contrast if

61
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:20,660
the land support duration suspension the

62
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,370
ongoing rage operation is immediately

63
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:26,209
free emptied by the reader :

64
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:30,560
and thus the agency of Ladera cast will

65
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:32,650
become 100 130 microsecond as shown in

66
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,140
the figure an existing registration

67
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:41,810
technique can reduce the lead deliquency

68
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:43,488
to sub 200 microsecond this fight social

69
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:47,269
dimension is the original registration

70
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:52,640
scheme can cause right revision as well

71
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:55,220
as meant elaborate problem so we've

72
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,708
proposed three tactically suspension

73
00:03:55,220 --> 00:04:00,230
techniques that are chip sub 200

74
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:03,860
microseconds lead tail latency without

75
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:08,209
having the problem of reservation and

76
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:11,209
interest elevation the modern and flash

77
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:14,680
memories performs today's operation with

78
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:17,840
multiple discrete purses and thus our

79
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:20,720
practical resolution technique perform a

80
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:25,310
racial tension on well aligned safe

81
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:28,340
point first the military the immediate

82
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:31,490
registration technique allows a very low

83
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:35,060
return latency by immediately suspending

84
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:37,160
the unknowingly IRA's oppression next

85
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:40,039
the deeper the registration technique

86
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:44,289
serves the right starvation problem by

87
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:44,289
allowing the current of step 2

88
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:51,169
eventually the time of PCI suspension

89
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,300
take the best of wars between the middle

90
00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:57,770
immediate area suspension and deployed

91
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:59,810
the research mission people describing

92
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:02,719
our practically resuspension technique

93
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:05,180
let me discuss how the existing

94
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,310
registration scheme can cause the

95
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:10,520
restoration and interest regulation

96
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:14,720
problems as shown in the figure let's

97
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:17,780
suppose the land begins raising a block

98
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:22,720
and around one millisecond of the

99
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:25,849
process or read the request comes in and

100
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:29,330
this number was also processed within

101
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:32,500
100 such microseconds thanks to the

102
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:36,020
registers mission at this time however

103
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:40,910
the energy Paris immediately suspended

104
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:44,539
when read returns number two comes in if

105
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:46,430
the read records are bursty the

106
00:05:44,539 --> 00:05:47,030
remainder is approach can never be

107
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:50,270
processed

108
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:53,780
this means this example shows the rage

109
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:58,789
operation can starve can starve if the

110
00:05:53,780 --> 00:06:01,429
reader has continued calm original

111
00:05:58,789 --> 00:06:04,310
presence stressed than flash memory so

112
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:06,710
that the endurance of an NAND depends on

113
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:09,500
the number of program and recycle

114
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:11,630
therefore the additional resist stresses

115
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:14,419
caused by the alleged suspension and

116
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:16,639
assumption also negatively affect the

117
00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:20,359
endurance of Anette endurance of an end

118
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:23,539
and it can probably arrange to an end

119
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:26,180
vlogs eventually such overly regional

120
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:26,780
and floods generate uncracked ability

121
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:31,460
errors

122
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:34,580
decreasing the internal services this so

123
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:38,060
using incremental sterilizing schemes

124
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:39,770
that's called isp we've proposed the

125
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:42,580
practical resource function technique

126
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:47,240
that does not cause the reservation and

127
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:49,550
interest aggravation problems I ISP is a

128
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,250
standard feature of modern than flash

129
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:54,950
memory gradually applying the higher

130
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,800
voltage e and minimizing traps on the

131
00:06:54,950 --> 00:07:00,000
lenses

132
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:03,690
a single race tab consists of open rage

133
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,479
parts and a Pied Pipers on red purse

134
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:10,590
extract the electrons from cells in an

135
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:13,050
and Vlad and a very Piper's detach turn

136
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:15,568
and the size in a block and decide

137
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:19,169
decide whether will not perform the next

138
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:21,449
arrested with a higher voltage generally

139
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:23,849
the modern NAND flash memories are

140
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:28,080
designed to complete the play greater

141
00:07:23,849 --> 00:07:30,990
operation within five times from now on

142
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,750
let me talk about how our practical

143
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:36,360
suspension can achieve the target

144
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:38,520
performance without side effect the

145
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,819
miniature suspension is a practical

146
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:45,719
variant of the original rear suspension

147
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:49,800
as shown in the figure command is

148
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:53,490
erosion of luck and a really thirsty

149
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:56,759
incoming the material suspension

150
00:07:53,490 --> 00:08:01,139
cancel the ongoing read step within 100

151
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:05,729
microseconds and the read request is

152
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:08,520
completed when this mini rates operation

153
00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:11,430
the military suspension the immediate

154
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:15,240
release function performs preparation

155
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:18,080
first such verify operation detects the

156
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:21,659
arising stated status of the land vlog

157
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:25,139
then if the land lab has already been

158
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:28,169
arranged to verify operation complete a

159
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:31,469
delayed operation without any additional

160
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:37,380
user process to prevent the mobile

161
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:40,020
racial problem but if Tara on arises one

162
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:43,020
year aged the size in Allan block the

163
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:47,310
immediate arrest suspension restart the

164
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:48,540
previously refers as a result unlike the

165
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:51,209
original suspension

166
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:56,490
immediate air suspension does not cause

167
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:59,160
the interest aggravation of SSD however

168
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:01,500
the immediate area suspension can

169
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:04,380
resolve the right starvation problem as

170
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,209
shown in the figure the right starvation

171

00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:11,660
reader test appears in

173
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:17,870
both the original ADA suspension and the

174
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:19,550
mediator suspension now let's see how

175
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:22,700
the particular suspension technique

176
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:26,060
reserves to right starvation problem in

177
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:30,770
this game an unrelated step is not

178
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:32,180
suspended by an incomplete retest this

179
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:35,180
technique suspends

180
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:39,890
delayed operation only having completed

181
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:43,880
the ongoing resistant and epitaph to

182
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:44,510
read operation is completed delay the

183
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:49,310
operation

184
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:50,860
religion from the next place in other

185
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:54,650
words the deferred raised suspension

186
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:59,200
prevent the rights division by ensuring

187
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:59,199
world progress for the u.s. operation

188
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:05,780
however this technique has longer Intel

189
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:07,820
latency than immediately suspension dos

190
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:13,160
although it has solved rights division

191
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:15,740
problems for immediate alleged

192
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:19,160
suspension and deprive a suspension have

193
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:22,730
their own advantages and we want to have

194
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:25,160
the best elbows so you'd like to propose

195
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:28,310
a payment based decision mechanism

196
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:30,920
called VP years 1000 base to the

197
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:35,089
suspension operates as an immediate

198
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:37,160
reservation mode for timer value and if

199
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:40,160
a specific write recast does not

200
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:42,860
complete within the timer switch to a

201
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:48,050
deep older deeper great suspension mode

202
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:50,810
to avoid rights division the time of

203
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:53,839
value is an effective latency controller

204
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:57,650
per user for example if we start our

205
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:59,920
value 260 pulmonary second and the

206
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:03,680
garbage collection induced right ratin

207
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:05,120
cs35 a millisecond and then the maximum

208
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:10,699
right latency

209
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:13,400
limit under 100 millisecond so we

210
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:15,380
evaluated our practical racial tension

211
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:19,189
technique with one micromanagement and

212
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:21,950
to your list you offered the timing

213
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:25,160
parameters of the lauritas in end

214
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:27,950
and SSD controller I use it to model our

215
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:29,750
schemes furthermore we had three

216
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:34,970
configurations to evaluation for

217
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:37,550
comparison here is the FAO random test

218
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:41,980
result this micro benchmark generate a

219
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:45,199
random pokerbot request with 70% of lead

220
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:48,710
30% right and stick to Nelson the new

221
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:51,740
test regarding realtor latency the

222
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:54,890
latency obeys reign is as long as by the

223
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:58,160
millisecond which is an entire array

224
00:11:54,890 --> 00:12:01,160
operation and the furtherance of tension

225
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:04,719
shows one millisecond of tell latency

226
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:07,430
which is single you ready for agency

227
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,280
immediate oral suspension and thermal

228
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:13,130
paste the resuspension make possible sub

229
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:15,579
200 microsecond of lead the latency by

230
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:18,560
canceling the ongoing responses

231
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:21,170
commercially the right Triton C of

232
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,229
immediate reference pension and time of

233
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:27,500
a serious tension test be longer because

234
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:33,860
such a scheme overage delays post

235
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:36,770
multiple times for database benchmark we

236
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:40,400
use aerospike certification tool called

237
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:43,280
a CT as soon as shown in the above table

238
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,000
ace it consists of three strike each

239
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,370
thread

240
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,540
generate each only test according to

241
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:53,560
predefined rate ICT has two evaluation

242
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:57,380
criteria popular test and stress test as

243
00:12:53,560 --> 00:13:01,099
shown in the table the SSD number one is

244
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:05,360
certificated for 2x multiplier and the

245
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:09,050
SSD number two is pro 8 X multiplier

246
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:11,750
which means that the SSD number 2 can be

247
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:17,270
brought times as much work as SSE number

248
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:20,240
one can hear is a CT reject the baseline

249
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:23,329
past all the politics multiplier because

250
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,790
of long media latency the original

251
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:27,710
suspension and the middle immediate read

252
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:30,199
suspension support from the right

253
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:34,370
starvation problem so they did replenish

254
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:36,080
the salty X multiplier the figure shows

255
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:38,810
the tail latency

256
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:41,120
certain experts layer the different

257
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:44,479
degrees of tension and time of a story

258
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:48,430
suspension shows the best rigid pool for

259
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,430
both stress test and performance test

260
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:55,339
finally we use TPCC benchmark to

261
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:58,699
evaluate our fat calorie suspension

262
00:13:55,339 --> 00:14:01,370
technique as for the retail latency the

263
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:03,649
baseline and the default rate suspension

264
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:07,190
they are both found to their own

265
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:10,700
characteristic which is an entire year

266
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:12,200
operation for the base rain and a single

267
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:15,200
raised part for the deployed race

268
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:18,230
extension the original RAZR suspension

269
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:20,959
and the mediator suspension also did

270
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:24,440
replenish the test because of the right

271
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:27,140
commence timer the timer place derail

272
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:29,360
suspension shows a similar lift a latent

273
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:32,329
strength to that of the default rate

274
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:35,060
suspension estimates that the timeout

275
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:38,089
has been triggered to switch to the

276
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:41,000
default duration suspension mode based

277
00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:43,670
on the retail latency behavior or the

278
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,940
time of a serious tension is right there

279
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:50,569
latency can be predictable for example

280
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:53,750
the 88 right 88 millisecond right tail

281
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:56,630
latency consists of a two section first

282
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:59,450
four time our value of a 64 millisecond

283
00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:01,939
the time of a steering suspension was

284
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:04,579
operating in military immediately

285
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:07,850
suspension mode while cancelling the

286
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:09,829
ongoing resistance second after a

287
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:12,920
timeout is triggered by the pending

288
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:16,130
right the u.s. suspension mode switch to

289
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:18,860
the polder assassination mode and the

290
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:22,399
SSD performs their garbage collection

291
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:24,380
operation for all users right retest in

292
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,240
other words although the right tail

293
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:28,970
latency or the time of a steer a

294
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,790
suspension is getting longer it's

295
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:35,800
deterministic and it can simply

296
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:35,800
controlled by the timeout value

297
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:42,210
in summary we propose practical

298
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:45,000
suspension techniques minimizing the

299
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:48,180
impact of arrays operation on beat

300
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,029
telogen C and achieving very rudest a

301
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:54,359
latency without reservation and interest

302
00:15:51,029 --> 00:15:57,390
elevation so we believe this is Kim's

303
00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:01,529
harness the full potential of NAND flash

304
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:09,240
waste SSD this is the end of my talk and

305
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:11,730
thank you for your attention thank you

306
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,410
very much this is a problem that it's

307
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:15,959
very good that someone finally solved

308
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:18,120
I'm specifically interested in the

309
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:20,010
timeout and setting the timeout who is

310
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:25,110
supposed to to determine what the

311
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:26,730
timeout is we have offer we have hope

312
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:29,399
from the sensitivity test for the time

313
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:31,670
of the loo so I would write you some

314
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:31,670
right

315
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:46,050
generally increasing PS time of value n

316
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:49,370
rowers frequency of high rates and lead

317
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:52,889
and decreases approach with latency

318
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:57,120
however it increases the maximum writer

319
00:16:52,889 --> 00:17:00,149
agency but the younger writer agency is

320
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,490
deterministic that's a very nice

321
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:07,369
trade-off so this is for the application

322
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:07,370
to determine what the latency should be

323
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:16,980
currently it is a static value however

324
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:22,500
we believe each control control control

325
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:24,540
the dynamic fashion using nvme special

326
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:27,750
comment for example suppose a command

327
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:33,928
it's controlled as it can control access

328
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:36,960
this function and MBA me io say is over

329
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:40,890
the field which is can control the

330
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:44,460
comment based fashion ok thank you very

331
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:48,090
much Oh watch it so actually actually

332
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:50,669
set by the user or it's the system admin

333
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:52,830
but it's based on one factor you need to

334
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:55,320
consider is what's the maximum target

335
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:57,240
target maximum right the agency so if

336
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,918
you actually have for example if your

337
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:02,730
maximum packet latency is a 100

338
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:05,880
