1
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,959
i've seen a little preview of it and i

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,679
think he's gonna

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,679
even mention certain things like uh

4
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,039
ancient scrolls

5
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:21,520
and tablets so um i am expecting that

6
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:24,080
maybe part of this video he recorded uh

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,960
right behind the pyramid of giza but

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,198
we'll see if that's really the case

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,160
go ahead ethan all right thank you very

10
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,800
much for that

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,920
i appreciate it um no no i'm not gonna i

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,760
didn't record any of it behind the

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,520
pyramid of giza but we do have egyptian

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,719
stuff in here so we'll we'll get to that

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,280
in a minute

16
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,680
so i i wanted to start out by answering

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,960
the question of why archival storage and

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,039
the reason is that

19
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,360
we'll get into this in more detail you

20
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,039
modern human society is built

21
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,800
on written transmission of data

22
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,079
originally it was analog data

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,919
but now it's digital data and this

24
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,600
transmission of digital data is becoming

25
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,239
increasingly important it used to be

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,960
that people might be able to

27
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,399
uh you know might be able to remember

28
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,399
everything they needed to remember

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,680
and in fact people ancient times had

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,760
better memories than we do

31
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,439
we actually know that but there's a

32
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,080
tremendous volume you can't

33
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,679
do that anymore okay used to be that you

34
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,360
had somebody who was a scientist who was

35
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,159
an expert literally at everything and

36
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,560
now

37
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,560
not so much so the question that we're

38
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,040
going to try to answer today

39
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,119
is how can we build systems that'll

40
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,240
store information for a really long time

41
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,840
that both a

42
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,000
preserve the bits themselves keeping

43
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,600
bits for centuries is not easy

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,200
heck we have trouble keeping bits for

45
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,039
five years

46
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,960
and of course the second thing is that

47
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,640
it's not enough to say here are the bits

48
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,919
five years from now i'm pretty sure

49
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,880
we'll be able to find something that

50
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,960
decodes a gif

51
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,960
even though we don't use them anymore

52
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,439
but 100 years from now or 200 years from

53
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,759
now

54
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,119
who knows so we've got to allow future

55
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,240
generations to access

56
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:59,759
information not just data not just

57
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,439
bits okay an example of this by the way

58
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,399
is 2 000 years old

59
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,320
it's the library at alexandria their

60
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,920
goal was to preserve all of what they

61
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,840
knew of as human knowledge and that's

62
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,520
what all the scrolls in here are

63
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,840
there are librarians in there and it did

64
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,879
really well of course until it burned

65
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,040
down

66
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,679
and the result of it burning down is

67
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,519
really echoed across the millennia

68
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,520
there are plays by ancient greek

69
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,160
playwrights that we don't have because

70
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,239
they burn

71
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,160
down with the library of alexandria well

72
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,760
that's really bad we lost that data

73
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,359
forever we know they existed

74
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,599
people referred to them we just don't

75
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,440
know what they said we'd like to prevent

76
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,839
that from happening to all of our stuff

77
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,840
as well

78
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,480
so let's start off by defining what we

79
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,239
mean by archival storage

80
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,560
there are a couple of potential things

81
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,400
first of all there's preserving bits

82
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,000
ensuring that you can read the bits

83
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,000
later if i give you a big

84
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,680
bag of bits don't tell you what they are

85
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,080
you can then say i'll give them back to

86
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,319
you

87
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,400
five years 10 years 100 years from now

88
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,238
100 years is getting pretty tough

89
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,840
and the reason 100 years gets tough is

90
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,519
that there are periodic refreshes you're

91
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,840
going to probably have to do

92
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,040
think about never mind 100 years ago

93
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,080
think about

94
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,079
20 30 years ago hard drives held

95
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,000
megabytes of data not not gigabytes or

96
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,440
terabytes megabytes

97
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,159
right think about the kinds of

98
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,599
interfaces the kinds of media you had

99
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,200
it would have been really hard to say

100
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,879
yeah let's keep it for 30 years and this

101
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,599
is by the way something we already run

102
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,280
into

103
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,959
you know when they find old tapes

104
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,640
sitting around in a mcdonald's

105
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,239
in a former mcdonald's no i'm not

106
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,720
kidding about this old tapes that have

107
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,040
nasa data on them gee that's great we

108
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,080
have the tape so where are the readers

109
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,480
well we have a problem but let's say you

110
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,000
could

111
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,920
read the data let's say you could get

112
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,400
the bits back

113
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,238
now we have a problem about information

114
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,799
okay so there are bits what do the bits

115
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,400
mean can you understand the bits now

116
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,400
this sounds like a pretty easy thing hey

117
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,879
i just look up the jpeg spec

118
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,799
yeah about that first of all the jpeg

119
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,959
spec's pretty big and second of all

120
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,640
this assumes you have the jpeg spec and

121
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,480
that you know how to read it properly

122
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,518
we'll talk more about these things over

123
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,119
the next approximately 50 minutes

124
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,879
but the big thing here is that it's not

125
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,200
enough to simply preserve the bits

126
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,720
you've got to preserve the meaning also

127
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,000
now sometimes you have functionality

128
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,599
that's a little bit of both like

129
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,160
integrity of information

130
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,759
it's very hard to tell if you've copied

131
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,560
the information right if you preserve it

132
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,120
properly if you don't understand

133
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,280
what the information is supposed to mean

134
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,280
okay

135
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,799
so why do we care about archival storage

136
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,638
well we care about it because our

137
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,880
civilization's legacy

138
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,840
gets passed on to the next generation

139
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,520
physically

140
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,840
right somehow physically whether it's an

141
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,520
oral or written or something else

142
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,599
we don't have information encoded in our

143
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,120
genes well at least we don't have that

144
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,280
yet i'm not going to talk about that

145
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,759
that's the biologist that's not me

146
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,520
okay historically we had analog

147
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,600
information so up until

148
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,520
let's say 50 years ago everything was

149
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,400
analog either oral you'd tell people

150
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,840
stuff

151
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,520
or it was written but these days the

152
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,119
vast majority of the information is

153
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,919
digital now i know what you're thinking

154
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,600
wait a minute movies video talks like

155
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,880
this this is analog right well

156
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,360
no it's analog for me but for every

157
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,000
single

158
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,280
other person listening to this talk it's

159
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,120
digital because

160
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,638
i'm a computer in my house and so are

161
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,199
you therefore

162
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,160
all this information is digital we've

163
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,919
got what i'll call

164
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,520
sensor data and by sensor i mean

165
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,440
something we got by sensing the world

166
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,599
around us like medical records

167
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,280
or videos and images right those are

168
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,199
sensors they're image sensors or

169
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,880
microphones they're sensors

170
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,560
internet of things sensors right all

171
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,199
those things are observations

172
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,400
of the real world then you have data

173
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,000
that's created

174
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,039
now you may say oh but a movie is

175
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,800
created right well sort of

176
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,199
the text the script is certainly created

177
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,120
by somebody the pictures

178
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,800
were originally however recorded by

179
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,120
sensors but then they were edited

180
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,120
or combined you know take a picture of

181
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,560
iron man but of course really iron man

182
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,479
in front of a green screen is a really

183
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,000
boring movie so there's lots of editing

184
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,159
and combining and that we have to

185
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,759
remember

186
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,600
now digital data therefore is

187
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,160
fundamental to future generations

188
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,880
because

189
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,520
as a culture as a society we pass

190
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,319
information

191
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,318
on to the future of course doing it

192
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,240
digitally poses unique challenges that

193
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,520
analog doesn't quite pose and we'll get

194
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,360
to those today

195
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,359
but before we do one quick thing and

196
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,000
that is this picture

197
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,240
now that's me from about 30 years ago

198
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,240
and that picture originally was analog

199
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,520
so i went back found the found the

200
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,280
photos scanned it in

201
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,639
no problem at all well mostly no problem

202
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,159
part of it is that it was printed on

203
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,080
photographic paper of course

204
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,280
photographic paper fades over time it's

205
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,039
30 years old

206
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,559
yes i'm actually a little obsessed if i

207
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,080
kept the negative and put it in a nice

208
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,919
safe place but still

209
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,440
will that be around in 100 years a lot

210
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,479
of films they're having trouble with

211
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,840
that

212
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:55,599
so let's talk about preserving

213
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:57,280
information preserving bits

214
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,560
if you were an ancient people you wanted

215
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,440
to give information to the next

216
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,520
generation

217
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,360
okay and there were two ways to do this

218
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,680
at first there was only oral

219
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,280
you could pass down information orally

220
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,840
you could tell the next generation

221
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,758
okay now oral transmission has some

222
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,000
rather serious problems with integrity

223
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,479
and

224
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,240
by integrity i mean keeping it so you

225
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,599
don't change things

226
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,840
if you've ever played a game of

227
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,880
telephone as a kid where you whisper

228
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,479
into the next person

229
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,639
a phrase and then it goes around the

230
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,599
circle eight people you hear what comes

231
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,000
out

232
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:30,000
boy does it get garbled imagine if all

233
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,120
of your information was treated that way

234
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,440
that's a problem with the world

235
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,160
transmission did he say the right thing

236
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,880
or not

237
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,560
what did that mean right uh that's a

238
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,120
problem with oral transmissions so they

239
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,199
developed

240
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,039
writing physical transmission much more

241
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,080
reliable because it's a symbol hopefully

242
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,639
it doesn't degrade over

243
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,560
time so on the left here on the top left

244
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,759
you have chinese ancient chinese writing

245
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,360
on bones

246
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,039
uh middle on the right you have egyptian

247
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,080
hieroglyphs in the middle on the left

248
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,318
you have a linear b

249
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,318
tablet more about that later and on the

250
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,960
bottom right you have mayan hieroglyphs

251
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,319
now these are

252
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,080
all ways to preserve analog information

253
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,440
now yes i know it's analog and not

254
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,960
digital and you're probably saying well

255
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,240
gee we're doing digital why do we care

256
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,758
about analog

257
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,680
well we care about it because these

258
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,759
examples are all well over

259
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,120
except for maybe the mayan well over a

260
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,639
thousand years old

261
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,039
therefore they managed to preserve

262
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,160
information from millennia can we do it

263
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,599
ourselves

264
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,360
well we have to make sure that number

265
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,400
one the media is reliable it doesn't

266
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,199
fall apart

267
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,919
that the media is readable a thousand

268
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,199
years later

269
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,120
we have to make sure there's data

270
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,360
integrity how do we know what we see

271
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,880
is what we were supposed to see and then

272
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,320
how do we preserve the meaning of the

273
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,360
information

274
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,560
so let's talk about that some media are

275
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,479
more reliable than others

276
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,159
okay paper which is on the upper right

277
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,360
that's the heracles papyrus third

278
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,959
century

279
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,760
is unreliable you have to constantly

280
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,119
recopy it parchment upper left which is

281
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,319
the dead sea scroll

282
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,080
is more reliable and it's still

283
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,680
vulnerable we were very lucky that those

284
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,040
things lasted 2 000 years most

285
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,519
parchments don't

286
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,880
now stone on the bottom left can be very

287
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,800
reliable

288
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,000
that is if nobody deliberately erases it

289
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,839
and

290
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,519
those egyptian hieroglyphics bring us to

291
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,000
a kind of first example it was not

292
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,320
uncommon

293
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,839
for an egyptian ruler to order that the

294
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,640
records of their predecessors

295
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,000
be erased and they sometimes did this by

296
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,439
chiseling and one reason we know about

297
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,200
ramses the second is his

298
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,279
he was he was pharaoh for a really long

299
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,120
time and chiseled really deep

300
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,480
now unless you think that this is just

301
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,360
something the ancient egyptians had a

302
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,000
problem with

303
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,000
it's not this is a cop this is a photo

304
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,160
that i took of a monument in the main

305
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,839
square in santa fe new mexico

306
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,360
says to the heroes who have fallen in

307
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,200
the various battles with

308
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,959
blank indians in the territory of new

309
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,800
mexico yeah see

310
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,160
uh see the sorry see the blank right

311
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,079
here yeah

312
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,519
that used to say something in fact i

313
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,399
looked it up it used to say

314
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:51,360
savage now with savage indians is really

315
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,120
not something you want to say so in 1974

316
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,959
an unknown man noticed this wasn't an

317
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,880
official thing an unknown man

318
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,399
wearing a hard hat chiseled out the word

319
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,080
from the monument

320
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,839
so how do we know it said savage in the

321
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,680
first place well found a book

322
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,680
the book had a copy from before and he

323
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,079
didn't modify the copy of the book

324
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,800
so by recopying information you can get

325
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,319
survival

326
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,920
if you only have one copy and you ruin

327
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,600
the one copy you lose data

328
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:17,279
okay so data integrity one way to do it

329
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,519
is have lots of copies this is mary

330
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,560
baker and david rosenthal doing lots of

331
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,640
copies keep

332
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:26,560
keep stuff stay safe l-o-c-k-s-s

333
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,839
well how do you make lots of copies and

334
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,839
because there are problems with errors

335
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,600
so one way you could do this

336
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,600
is to complicate the material this is a

337
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,839
page of from psalms

338
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,600
and notice it's beautifully decorated

339
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,440
you've got all those flowers

340
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,200
you know flowers fancy letters and

341
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,560
everything part of the reason for

342
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,160
complicating it of course

343
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,719
it's a prayer we want to make it look

344
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,399
nice but also because

345
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,839
we want to make sure you take the time

346
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,440
to do it right and it turns out

347
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,040
according to the person who owns this

348
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,839
which is my colleague professor darryl

349
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,760
long

350
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,360
they made a mistake they actually said

351
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,800
the word god twice where it should have

352
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,440
only been once so they even made a

353
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,519
mistake despite having tried not to

354
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,120
okay so maybe that's one way to do it is

355
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,160
you have complicated you complicate the

356
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,880
material

357
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,839
but you can go further that's a torah

358
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,519
scroll

359
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:15,760
um and there are rules for copying it

360
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,720
so you can see it's it's kind of hard to

361
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,120
see up here

362
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,959
right that this is made of of sheets of

363
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,040
parchment sewn together

364
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,479
if you make a mistake you are required

365
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,719
to correct the mistake

366
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,480
if you cannot correct the mistake you

367
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,839
throw out the parchment you cannot put

368
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,120
it in saying you know cross it off and

369
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,680
put the right thing later

370
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,079
not allowed there are lots of rules for

371
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:39,359
copying a torah scroll that makes sure

372
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,719
that you do it right okay now

373
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,399
the last thing you could do is just make

374
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,839
lots of copies right and here's an

375
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,839
example of making lots of copies

376
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,920
ever since people started recording

377
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:56,160
information there's been a need to

378
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:58,719
duplicate it

379
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,680
nice work brother dominique thank you

380
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,000
very

381
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:10,729
nice now i would like

382
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:12,160
500 more sets

383
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:15,200
[Music]

384
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,760
heather dominic how are you

385
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,200
could you do a big job for me your your

386
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:25,839
sets father

387
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:25,839
the 500 cents you asked for

388
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,880
so as you can tell that was an ad for

389
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,120
xerox from the mid-1970s that's the

390
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:36,839
reason why the quality isn't so great

391
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:40,320
and the point here is that by doing this

392
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:41,279
right you were able to you got integrity

393
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,600
of information

394
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:45,120
right and basically you got lots of

395
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,800
copies of course they spent their lives

396
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,079
copying books the joke is now they were

397
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,399
able to do it this way

398
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,399
all right

399
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,360
so next we want to preserve meaning okay

400
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,160
how do we preserve meaning we often

401
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,000
assume

402
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,760
that languages don't change over time

403
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,279
but of course they do spanish

404
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,439
italian and um french are all basically

405
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,720
corruptions of latin corruptions

406
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,040
evolutions whatever you want to call

407
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,800
them

408
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,959
right but it's not just the languages

409
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,439
it's the symbols themselves that change

410
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:15,040
okay and one example of this that i ran

411
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,720
into is that if you look at the dead sea

412
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,599
scrolls it turns out the hebrew is

413
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,959
readable

414
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,639
believe it or not you can read the

415
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,239
hebrew on the dead sea scrolls if you

416
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,480
know modern hebrew

417
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,079
except for one part where they have four

418
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,360
letters that are unreadable and the

419
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,040
reason they're unreadable is it was the

420
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,320
name of god and the old script

421
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,360
they didn't want to translate to the new

422
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,800
script because they weren't sure that

423
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,519
was okay

424
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,599
but over long periods of time everything

425
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,760
changes and here's an example of this

426
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,120
on the top right you have these are both

427
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,519
by the way tablets

428
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,720
from the island of crete the top right

429
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,000
is something is written in what's called

430
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,240
linear b

431
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,320
which for centuries we couldn't read

432
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,279
until the mid-1950s when someone

433
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,519
decrypted it

434
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,800
essentially discovering hey this is

435
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,720
ancient greek

436
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,120
with weird symbols well now we can read

437
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,040
it on the bottom right is linear a

438
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,839
yeah it turns out we have no idea what

439
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:07,279
that says so the bits are preserved yay

440
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,079
can't read them so how do we how do we

441
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,160
fix this

442
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,920
well approach number one is to translate

443
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,319
during copying so you can see our

444
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,839
our page from psalms again and the idea

445
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,760
is that you just translate into the new

446
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,079
language each time

447
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,920
now this was actually translated from

448
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,439
hebrew to greek and then greek to latin

449
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,439
in all likelihood i don't think the

450
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,880
the vulgate was translated directly from

451
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,160
the hebrew

452
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,839
problem is you can get errors in

453
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,000
translations and this is what you get

454
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,000
when you have errors in translation

455
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
the hebrew word for rays of light is

456
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,519
karen which sounds an awful lot like the

457
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,199
greek word

458
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,639
like the greek and latin root cornu

459
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,399
which means horns

460
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,480
rays of light coming out of moses's head

461
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,959
turns into horns on moses's head

462
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,199
oops we screwed up okay well we fixed

463
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,920
that we know jews don't have horns

464
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,760
but there are more serious problems okay

465
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,839
the sixth commandment in hebrew is low

466
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,839
tiered sach which translated directly

467
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,199
means don't

468
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:01,120
murder probably a lot of people are

469
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,920
familiar with thou shalt not kill well

470
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,720
kill and murder the same idea except

471
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,199
murder means

472
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,040
it's justified it's not murder anymore

473
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,639
kill is kill for any reason

474
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,480
so if some guy is shooting at you and

475
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,440
you shoot back that's killing but it's

476
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,760
not murder

477
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,959
sixth commandment allows it in hebrew

478
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,399
but not in english

479
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:22,479
oops now the second approach

480
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,160
is the rosetta stone let's provide

481
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,279
versions in multiple languages in this

482
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,560
case we have

483
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:30,240
hieroglyphics hieratic and greek even

484
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,758
with these multiple versions it was

485
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,560
still hard to translate the

486
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,199
the hieroglyphics and was only possible

487
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,800
because

488
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:39,199
some of the hyratic was written in

489
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,719
coptic which had phonemes

490
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,479
and because the names of some of the

491
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,079
egyptian rulers were in cartouches and a

492
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,079
cartoon is just an oval

493
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,000
with the symbols inside it so with

494
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,560
multiple simultaneous versions we can

495
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,639
understand

496
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,119
maybe but we take extra space that's not

497
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,120
so good

498
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,639
okay so now let's get to the part where

499
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,800
we have things that we can do as systems

500
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,560
people

501
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,319
the first thing we want to do is build

502
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,599
systems to preserve the bits because i

503
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,600
don't care what you do to try and

504
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,440
preserve the meaning that doesn't do any

505
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,720
good unless you actually have bits to

506
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,240
translate

507
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,480
so the first thing we're going to worry

508
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,199
about is how reliable is the underlying

509
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,079
media

510
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:17,040
right how long does it last if you write

511
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,399
something there how

512
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,560
you know how quickly you have to go back

513
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,240
and fix it second thing you have to

514
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,560
worry about is performance something

515
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,680
like

516
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,839
stone right very very durable but

517
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,199
really slow writing i mean chisel chisel

518
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,199
chisel chisel

519
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,959
right third thing we're concerned about

520
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:36,000
is volumetric density if i store

521
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,359
me data in this medium how big is it is

522
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,639
this thing something i can carry around

523
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,399
in my pocket or is this something that i

524
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,839
have to build an entire temple for like

525
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,240
stone

526
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,079
next you have overall system cost okay

527
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,440
we want to store data but we're cheap we

528
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,959
don't want to pay for it

529
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,720
and it's especially an issue for

530
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,079
archival data because it's not something

531
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,959
that you have to pay for once you have

532
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,758
to pay for it

533
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:57,599
for the next hundred years there are two

534
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,839
things you worry about

535
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,360
one of them is capital expenses how much

536
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,759
does it cost to buy the media how much

537
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,800
does it

538
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,640
cost to buy the equipment and the

539
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,399
infrastructure and so on and then

540
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,919
operational expenses okay you bought

541
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,520
everything now how much does it cost to

542
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,280
run the thing

543
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,119
now it's very often the case that high

544
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,119
capital expense systems have low

545
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,559
operating expenses or vice versa

546
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,159
but there's a good reason for this it's

547
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,000
not something that's uh you know that

548
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,959
that's just uh intrinsic one way or the

549
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,799
other it's that

550
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,079
if it's expensive to buy it and it's

551
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,918
expensive to maintain it

552
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,760
why would you use that get what it's

553
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,319
expensive to buy and cheap to maintain

554
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,879
or

555
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,000
cheap to buy expensive to maintain right

556
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,840
now if you say well both

557
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,440
capital expense and operating expense

558
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,240
are low well then all the other media go

559
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,080
away unless the performance is an issue

560
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,960
but there are intangible things too that

561
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,639
you can't encode this way

562
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,559
one of them is can you read the media

563
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,640
with lesser technology

564
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,840
for example microfiche which is how

565
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,679
people used to store a lot of

566
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,559
information just photographs greatly

567
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,200
reduced of

568
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,639
paper now this sounds like a kind of a

569
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,240
primitive technology but the nice thing

570
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,039
is all you need is a magnifying glass

571
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,400
and a light

572
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,240
now we've been able to build those for

573
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,200
400 years so you can store a lot of

574
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,679
stuff that way

575
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,679
right whereas if i were to hand you a

576
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,760
blu-ray disc and say uh we don't have a

577
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,480
blu-ray player go read that

578
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,080
very difficult but not as bad by the way

579
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,919
as here's an ssd go read

580
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,439
that at least the blu-ray disc have a

581
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,400
chance of shining light off of it and

582
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,720
building a system

583
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,440
the ssd you're going there's cells in

584
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,200
here however i read those

585
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,840
zero power maintenance is another sort

586
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,440
of intangible and these are just

587
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,439
examples can i take the media stuff

588
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,200
in my closet or in a cave and come back

589
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,120
in 50 years and expect to be able to

590
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,160
read it with no power no maintenance no

591
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,760
nothing

592
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,559
for some media the answer is yes for

593
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:43,280
other media the answer is yeah maybe not

594
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:45,760
so let's talk about media we also care

595
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:48,000
about performance

596
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,440
we care about two things latency and

597
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,120
bandwidth which i'm sure you're all used

598
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,080
to except that

599
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:56,080
we only care about latency for read if

600
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,320
we want to get data back and even if the

601
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,559
latency is a day it may be okay well

602
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,080
this is a really cheap archive medium

603
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,480
but it'll take a day to get your data

604
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,840
back

605
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,880
that's okay i can wait for a day it was

606
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:09,199
cheap now bandwidth we only care about

607
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,480
or we primarily care about for rights

608
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,240
how much data can i write per day right

609
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,919
the reason that that's the case is that

610
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,720
all of the data in your archive

611
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,320
has to be written exactly once yes i

612
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,520
know you quote overwrite it but then you

613
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,080
have to write the original and write the

614
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,879
new so

615
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,678
exactly once but only some of your data

616
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,919
might be read

617
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,000
how much data depends on the workload

618
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,679
some some systems the answer is one one

619
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,799
hundredth of one percent or even less of

620
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,880
the data is read

621
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,080
or we just keep it just in case uh

622
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,360
sarbanes-oxley

623
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,600
we keep it in case the federal

624
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,439
government gets on it gets after us

625
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,959
other ones like facebook well more of

626
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,840
the data gets read and

627
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,679
somewhere it's even more of that there

628
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,360
is however one additional operation

629
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,960
that's called refresh which is not the

630
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,918
same thing as writing and reading

631
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,440
it says how do i make a new copy of data

632
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,039
that's already in the archive

633
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,640
now for some media that involves reading

634
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,559
it and then writing it but for other

635
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,159
media let's say like dna

636
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,840
i can make a copy of dna without

637
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,919
actually reading and writing it i just

638
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,000
you know put a put the appropriate

639
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:10,159
materials in and the appropriate enzymes

640
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,840
and i have a copy no reading and writing

641
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,720
necessary so those are the three things

642
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,720
we want to keep in mind

643
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:19,039
now when we talk about preserving the

644
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:22,640
bits we have lots of choices

645
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:26,960
for media okay for example

646
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,960
we have oh goodness

647
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,240
we had sorry about that my computer just

648
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,480
went to sleep that's always lots of fun

649
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,159
okay so we have lots of choices for

650
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,559
long-term archival storage everything

651
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,360
from

652
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,960
tape and disk to ssd and blu-ray and on

653
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,918
the bottom some newer technologies like

654
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,000
glass and dna

655
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,600
we'll go into each of these individually

656
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,200
but we want to know how to choose the

657
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,039
right medium and what happens if this

658
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,280
choice evolves over time you know

659
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:53,679
dna i can tell you right now not really

660
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,120
viable in terms of cost currently

661
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,280
doesn't mean it won't be in 5 or 10

662
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,879
years and we'll talk about that

663
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,559
so we're going to compare the trade-offs

664
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,720
between the cost the upfront and the

665
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,440
operating expense the reliability and

666
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,720
durability

667
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,200
bandwidth and latency and we're going to

668
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:10,799
use radar charts to compare these media

669
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,240
okay so let's start off first with tape

670
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,918
and these radar charts all going to have

671
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,200
the same things now one thing you'll

672
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,760
notice here by the way

673
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,760
is that some of these things are really

674
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,000
weird like why is read latency in

675
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,360
inverses of seconds well because we

676
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,440
wanted to make bigger better

677
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,559
and well a higher read latency is not a

678
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,799
better thing

679
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,960
so we did one over seconds it's i know

680
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:33,280
it's artificial but the goal here is to

681
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,520
see the shape of the blotch

682
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,280
which tells you what it's good at so

683
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,158
tape is good because these are further

684
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,559
out at

685
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,400
media cost and infrastructure cost not

686
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,720
so good at density

687
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,320
uh so-so and operating expense read

688
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,960
latency and right latency aren't great

689
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,639
and right

690
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,559
right bandwidth aren't that great either

691
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,000
okay

692
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,840
so the big problem here we've got an

693
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,280
access latency of five to 100 seconds

694
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,959
and that's with a tape robot but you do

695
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,000
have good bandwidth 200 plus megabytes

696
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,919
per second and

697
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,039
well our media cost is about five

698
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,039
dollars a terabyte

699
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:05,360
currently infrastructure costs the

700
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,799
drives are expensive

701
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,320
good news here we don't have this is the

702
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,400
durability is pretty good if we have

703
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,600
infrequent reads and writes

704
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:15,520
tape is durable we can read it after 40

705
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,039
or 50 years and we know because well

706
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,639
it's been around for that long and we've

707
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,720
red taped that with that old

708
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,720
so we know that tape is a decent way to

709
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,000
store data for a long time it's a proven

710
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,000
technology

711
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,080
and the nice thing is that at least for

712
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,039
tape generally speaking you don't

713
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,960
have to touch it for five ten years it'd

714
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,559
be nice if you retention the reel

715
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,559
you know unwound it rewound it but

716
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,240
that's not absolutely essential

717
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,520
so it's a pretty good medium and it's

718
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,760
the sort of thing where you go i gotta

719
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,879
beat that if you're gonna win

720
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,919
okay so what's next well next we have

721
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,799
optical disk

722
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:50,640
okay for optical disk it's again a

723
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:53,039
relatively mature technology

724
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,799
okay access latency yeah it's gonna take

725
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,799
seconds to load it about 20 milliseconds

726
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,320
to seek to a new location so load time

727
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,840
again removable media

728
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,520
on the order of a minute but once you

729
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,799
have it loaded you can seek anywhere on

730
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,799
the disk you want

731
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,240
bandwidth not for your your garden

732
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,480
variety blu-ray but the ones that

733
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,240
panasonic and other companies sell

734
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,080
about 180 megabytes a second which is

735
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,600
pretty good media cost

736
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,080
yeah that's where it gets you you're

737
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,158
talking about tens of dollars per

738
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,678
terabyte which is really expensive

739
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,200
but the good news is the infrastructure

740
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,679
cost can be really cheap

741
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,360
right now as far as blu-ray goes the

742
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,640
drives can wear out

743
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,639
in fact you have to buy new drives

744
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,559
occasionally but the disc media itself

745
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,480
is incredibly durable

746
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,720
there's a type of media called mdisc

747
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,600
which is actually which actually uses

748
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,640
an inorganic pigment and when you burn

749
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,120
the dvd

750
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,120
or blu-ray you literally burn the the

751
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,559
inorganic material it's supposed to last

752
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,479
for on the order of millennia in fact

753
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:48,960
ndisk stands for millennia disk

754
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,159
okay so that's that's nice it means i

755
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,960
can make my

756
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,919
archive copy put it on the shelf in the

757
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,520
salt mine

758
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,360
and come back to it in 20 years and

759
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,639
still read it if i have drives available

760
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,320
which is good

761
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,159
right so again the infrastructure cost

762
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,240
here is very low so that's kind of

763
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,679
pretty far out to the side

764
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,440
read latency right latency are pretty

765
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,520
good density is not great

766
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,039
operating expense so so in media cost

767
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,960
that's pretty high but you can see the

768
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:15,440
shape there

769
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:18,320
next we go to disk disk has actually

770
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,520
even worse density than optical disk but

771
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,200
on the other hand it's not that

772
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,120
expensive it's twenty dollars a terabyte

773
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,400
for media about five for infrastructure

774
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,158
i can run the darn thing off of a

775
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,440
raspberry pi in fact i can run several

776
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,200
drives off of it

777
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,880
performance is great 10 millisecond

778
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,000
access latency and 200 megabytes a

779
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,440
second bandwidth

780
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,360
but we're not going to get discs to be

781
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,600
that much denser the density increase

782
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,039
has slowed down

783
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,879
the big problem with discs is that

784
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,320
they're not very durable they last five

785
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,080
to seven years

786
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,918
according to people in the disk industry

787
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,439
yeah we could build 10-year disks or

788
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:50,000
12-year disks but

789
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,600
10-12 years i want a hundred so i'm

790
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,679
gonna have to keep copying over and over

791
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:57,840
that's going to increase my cost

792
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:59,600
for operating expenses okay

793
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,520
what about flash flash it turns out is

794
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,360
actually a very interesting one because

795
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,960
it's not quite mature but we are limited

796
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,959
and we're getting there

797
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,960
and growth rates limited latency and

798
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,120
bandwidth absolutely obscene 50

799
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,159
microsecond read latency one gigabyte

800
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,639
per second right

801
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,559
bandwidth that's great cost on the other

802
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,640
hand yeah eighty dollars a terabyte for

803
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:23,039
media that's at eight cents a gig

804
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:25,360
okay um and same kind of five dollars

805
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,400
for infrastructure now the durability is

806
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,760
interesting

807
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,520
the flash itself doesn't go bad as long

808
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:34,240
as you don't write it

809
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,760
however if you don't write it the bits

810
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,200
leak out over time

811
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,039
now you probably don't notice this

812
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,880
because consumer flash has high

813
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,000
retention at the cost of lower number of

814
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,640
writes

815
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,919
but it turns out that if you wait long

816
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,760
enough the bits leak out they're just

817
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,360
capacitors it's like dram with a much

818
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,919
slower leak

819
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,120
why is that important because we can't

820
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,960
just put it on the shelf

821
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,559
if you do that and come back in 10 years

822
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,840
it's a good bet much of your data will

823
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,240
be corrupted

824
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,678
we don't want that okay so that's again

825
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,440
something to think about

826
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:07,440
when you're considering how to actually

827
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,640
decide what what material what media to

828
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,919
use

829
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:14,559
so now we have project silica this is a

830
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:17,440
microsoft project to write data in glass

831
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,879
okay and you can see a picture here of

832
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,760
someone holding up the glass that

833
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,600
they're using

834
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,520
physical position for for read latency

835
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,199
could be 50 milliseconds right bandwidth

836
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,960
i've heard about 50 megabytes a second

837
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,710
for right once

838
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:32,819
and the read the read uh

839
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:32,819
[Music]

840
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,480
thunderbird why it's glass glass is

841
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,799
really cheap

842
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,000
okay infrastructure costs the writers

843
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:47,120
are likely

844
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,720
more expensive okay however

845
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,039
the the readers are going to be less

846
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,840
expensive and that hopefully will work

847
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,840
pretty well

848
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,559
now if you then look at durability and

849
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,600
reliability

850
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:04,080
this is glass the media and the engraved

851
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,840
data

852
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,360
should last centuries as long as you

853
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,240
don't drop it again it makes little

854
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,639
microscopic

855
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,919
holes in glass basically it evaporates

856
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,600
the glass leaves a little hole and they

857
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,799
can change the shape of the hole and

858
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,240
everything else

859
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,600
there's a whole talk on this which i

860
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,039
encourage you to look at if you're

861
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,080
interested in looking for it it's it's

862
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,679
online

863
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,760
but the idea is that this is a much

864
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,279
cheaper medium and it is a hands-off

865
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,399
medium you can let it go

866
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:29,360
and just it works now when we get to the

867
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,719
end you'll see different

868
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,559
shapes of things but this is the first

869
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,399
one that has a different shape write and

870
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,240
read are a little worse but opex is

871
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,840
really good and media cost is really

872
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,720
good infrastructure cost is pretty good

873
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,279
too

874
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:44,559
slightly different shape off center than

875
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,559
what we had for tape and disk

876
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,039
now we have dna dna is a totally

877
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,918
different shape

878
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,480
it is dna as you can see is incredibly

879
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,039
dense

880
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,840
okay all right it's the densest of the

881
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:58,799
media we have

882
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,639
volumetric density is amazingly high on

883
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,799
the other hand read latency is really

884
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,440
bad read latency is on the order of a

885
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,600
day

886
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,640
yes a day why you have to do dna

887
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,320
sequencing

888
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,240
we know how to do this but it does take

889
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:13,520
about a day okay

890
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,919
now over here you have operating expense

891
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,440
again

892
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,520
pretty darn bad because you got to keep

893
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,760
the dna refrigerated and everything else

894
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,039
infrastructure costs pretty bad millions

895
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,960
of dollars for writers

896
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,720
uh we hope this will go down and we'll

897
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,640
talk about that in a minute

898
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,640
right bandwidth we think is also pretty

899
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,679
bad for now but all this will improve

900
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,440
over time

901
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,279
at least we know meat dna is durable

902
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,120
because well we can hopefully

903
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:38,000
reconstruct a mammoth and well that's

904
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,000
done with dna

905
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:44,960
okay oops

906
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,559
now what we're going to do next is do a

907
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,880
comparison of all of them and i've taken

908
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,960
all of those previous graphs

909
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,240
and superimposed them now i know this is

910
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,200
a very busy thing but that's all i've

911
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,960
done here is

912
00:28:53,200 --> 00:29:00,640
superimpose the previous graphs okay

913
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:02,240
now once i've done that

914
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,000
i can talk about some things first of

915
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,760
all glass this is usually the same color

916
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,799
so glass is over here it's the red it's

917
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,799
pretty promising

918
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:10,158
right read latency and right and right

919
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,520
bandwidth are a little worse than some

920
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:14,320
of the other ones

921
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,360
but they're worse than flash well flash

922
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,879
is going to be pretty good

923
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,719
okay there are slight lags in

924
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,039
performance but cost is an issue

925
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,360
but cost is pretty good here pretty good

926
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,960
here infrastructure cost may likely drop

927
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,520
as the technology matures

928
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,799
that's a good thing let's look at disk

929
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,520
disk is green

930
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:32,799
notice the disk has higher optics and

931
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,000
it's got media cost

932
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:36,960
and everything else disk is actually not

933
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,640
entirely

934
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,720
inside of flash because it's got lower

935
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,240
infrastructure cost and better bandwidth

936
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,360
but if you don't want to read it very

937
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:48,159
often maybe glass is a better bet

938
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,879
flash amazingly good read and write you

939
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,720
knew that

940
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,840
infrastructure cost is low but media

941
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,679
cost it's the worst of them

942
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:57,520
okay and you know opex over here is also

943
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,320
pretty good but media cost and that's a

944
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,639
big thing

945
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,360
flash is kind of expensive sorry about

946
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,520
that

947
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,120
so flash needs to improve opex and media

948
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,799
cost dna

949
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,799
if you look over here it's great at

950
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:10,879
density everything else is

951
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,320
really bad you know we kind of figured

952
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,440
that there is a lot of room for

953
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,240
improvement though and that's what we're

954
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,840
going to try to project here

955
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,840
this is what we think it might be in the

956
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,439
future well five ten years out and again

957
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,039
this is just a guess because hey if i

958
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,000
knew the answer here

959
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:26,879
i could make a lot of money i don't tape

960
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,399
you're going to get a lot of

961
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,320
you're going to get significant capacity

962
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:31,520
growth up to say 400 terabytes in one

963
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,320
tape cartridge

964
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:36,320
disk growth however is becoming limited

965
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,760
ssds are getting denser so ssds are

966
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,600
doing pretty well but notice the media

967
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,279
and the media cost here however is

968
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,439
getting a little bit worse

969
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:45,360
for ssd is just because it's getting

970
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,720
worse relative to the other ones

971
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,000
okay it is likely the glass will

972
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,760
overwhelm tape however

973
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:57,120
because here's glass in red

974
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:58,480
and tape is in black what it means to

975
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,719
overwhelm it is that

976
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,320
tape has a slightly better density

977
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,120
volumetric density everything else is

978
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,200
worse

979
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,799
than it is for glass when something like

980
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,159
that happens the technology is going to

981
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,918
disappear

982
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,679
optical disk isn't even on here because

983
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,799
we know it's going to disappear relative

984
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,480
to glass and

985
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:17,120
tape okay now what that means is that

986
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,640
dna

987
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,080
notice how instead of being as narrow as

988
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,760
it was it's getting broader but it's

989
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,918
still pretty big and by the way

990
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:26,158
dna here we're giving it a four orders

991
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:28,080
of magnitude drop on media cost

992
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,440
and a three orders of magnitude drop on

993
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,199
infrastructure cost and it's still

994
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,600
behind so you're talking about needing

995
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,720
six to seven orders of magnitude could

996
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,039
that happen

997
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,880
yes i'm not going to try to predict

998
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,080
whether it will or not i have no idea

999
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,480
whether it won't

1000
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,080
but if it does happen dna has a big

1001
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,399
advantage on density and longevity

1002
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,840
meaning maybe you really want to use dna

1003
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:50,239
for your archive and that's something to

1004
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,240
consider

1005
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,200
all right so now we have to worry about

1006
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,720
long-term retention right

1007
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,320
couple key questions do bits last

1008
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,279
forever after you write them how likely

1009
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,799
are they to rock

1010
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,559
change over time in ways you don't

1011
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,120
predict and how much maintenance do they

1012
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,799
need

1013
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,639
do i need to go through and refresh this

1014
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:09,279
every every month or every year

1015
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,200
or do i just put in a salt mine tape and

1016
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:13,279
glass tape glass and optical discs are

1017
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,880
all put in a salt mine glass

1018
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,399
stuff i mean you could apparently dunk

1019
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,399
it in seawater for for

1020
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:19,840
you know a year and it's not injured

1021
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:21,840
which is pretty impressive

1022
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,879
but other media may require more chair

1023
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,678
more care because

1024
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,360
ssd cells they leak i need to refresh i

1025
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,399
gotta actually have power and do active

1026
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,240
stuff

1027
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:31,439
discs may fail to spin up and the longer

1028
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,880
you leave them without spinning them up

1029
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,320
the longer the more likely it is that

1030
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:38,080
the lubricant will actually

1031
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:40,000
make them stick dna may require refresh

1032
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,519
and i say may because it depends are you

1033
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,039
keeping it in ideal conditions

1034
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:46,320
or you're leaving on a shelf where it's

1035
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:46,320
kind of warm out right

1036
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,840
so what's the best option well uh it

1037
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,000
depends

1038
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,600
a lot things like how much do you want

1039
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,240
to read how much data are you likely to

1040
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,320
want to read

1041
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,480
all of it some of it almost none of it

1042
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:01,039
never unless i'm absolutely forced to

1043
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,080
how important is latency how fast do you

1044
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,679
want to write in other words

1045
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,600
are you generating a gigabyte of data a

1046
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,840
day or a gigabyte of data a second

1047
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,399
it kind of matters how important is it

1048
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:12,879
to have hands-off retention take this

1049
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:14,239
away make three copies put them in three

1050
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,919
different continents in places that

1051
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,840
don't have earthquakes

1052
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:19,600
how important is the physical inability

1053
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,120
to modify data and the reason this is

1054
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,799
important we'll get to in a minute is

1055
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,479
integrity

1056
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:26,399
these properties define the system

1057
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,840
constraints and now we can then model

1058
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:29,840
system cost and reliability

1059
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,679
one big question here is how do you pay

1060
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:36,240
for this stuff

1061
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:38,000
right users want to say i created the

1062
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,159
data here's your money

1063
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,679
problem is uh you created the data and

1064
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,559
you want me to keep it forever for a

1065
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:45,120
fixed fee

1066
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:46,720
uh oh well flickr and youtube you know

1067
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,439
flickr not anymore but you know

1068
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:51,279
youtube a lot of other places collect

1069
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,840
money from usage

1070
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:55,600
the problem is archival storage could

1071
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,678
have ongoing costs well for glass maybe

1072
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,639
it's just a warehouse but other things

1073
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:02,480
refresh cycles management costs cost of

1074
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,679
the warehouse cost of you know power

1075
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,279
everything else

1076
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,760
and of course usage falls off

1077
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:09,918
dramatically as data gets older

1078
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,040
so do i trade off a high initial cost

1079
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:12,638
i'll charge you a lot of money but then

1080
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,800
it won't cost me anything to maintain it

1081
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,879
that's good maybe fewer reset refresh

1082
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,200
cycles data is more likely to get lost

1083
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:21,279
do i pay for ongoing storage when i when

1084
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:23,759
when i get revenue from new data

1085
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,119
well here's the thing that looks like

1086
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,800
let's say there's an exponential growth

1087
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,760
and demand for the first five years like

1088
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,079
your youtube

1089
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,040
okay there are three possible things

1090
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,200
first one is

1091
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:36,399
the rate of growth started at 20 a year

1092
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:39,520
and then goes to 30 and 40 and 50. well

1093
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:41,118
that's going to be this okay your new

1094
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,800
data because you're storing so much more

1095
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,560
of it overwhelms your old data and you

1096
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,399
can pay for the old data with what you

1097
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:48,320
collect for new data

1098
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:50,480
what if the growth rate stays constant

1099
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,240
let's say 20 a year

1100
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,240
turns out the ratio of all data to new

1101
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:56,000
data about remains constant which isn't

1102
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:58,160
so bad

1103
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,560
but what happens if people start say

1104
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:02,399
look i'm not going to continue to add 20

1105
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,078
more than is already in the archive i'm

1106
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,839
just going to add a fixed amount of data

1107
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,400
every year

1108
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:10,320
guess what the old data overwhelms the

1109
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,160
new data and you can't pay for storing

1110
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,760
the old data by charging people for new

1111
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,960
data they go wait why is it four times

1112
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,240
more expensive

1113
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,680
oh because we have a lot of old data to

1114
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,640
take care of yeah i'm not paying for

1115
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,919
that

1116
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:23,200
this is a problem it's what happens when

1117
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,760
you try to pay for

1118
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,520
old data using revenue from new data

1119
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,599
doesn't necessarily work

1120
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,119
yes you can try to collect interest but

1121
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,800
that's that that that's now

1122
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:36,640
the the province of economic of

1123
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:38,480
economists not of computer scientists

1124
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:41,118
and when storage stops getting cheaper

1125
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:44,000
over time well

1126
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:45,280
we have a problem we don't know what the

1127
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
cheap what the best way to store the

1128
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,359
data is

1129
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,680
storage isn't getting cheaper we can't

1130
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:50,960
just rely on oh copy it'll be so cheap

1131
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,879
we'll save money

1132
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,119
not necessarily anymore storage isn't

1133
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,119
getting cheaper as much as it was

1134
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:59,040
flash is hitting size limits disk isn't

1135
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:01,119
growing at 50 a year

1136
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,200
dna and glass are promising glass is

1137
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,720
probably closer to being ready than dna

1138
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,078
in terms of cost but they're not yet

1139
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,319
ready

1140
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:09,760
so that's one problem next problem is

1141
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,200
what happens when new storage isn't

1142
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,720
denser than old storage

1143
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,720
maybe make our storage devices last

1144
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,680
longer disks instead of getting lasting

1145
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,399
for five years

1146
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,919
last for twelve why well i can't buy a

1147
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,280
new disk that's thirty times bigger may

1148
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:25,040
as well make the old one last longer

1149
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,280
and it's important to understand these

1150
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:29,279
answers because we have to know the

1151
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:32,720
answers at least think we know them

1152
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:34,160
when we create the archive so let's look

1153
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,319
at cost over time

1154
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,839
after zero years right in other words

1155
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,320
when you create the archive this is a

1156
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:39,920
this is

1157
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:43,119
some work that my student james byron

1158
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,640
did after zero years dna is really

1159
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:46,400
expensive if you want to support for a

1160
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,279
petabyte scale archive if you wanted to

1161
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,560
support

1162
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,320
on the order of 10 million read

1163
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,759
operations per year

1164
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,680
right that's after zero years looks

1165
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,680
pretty clear-cut don't use dna

1166
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,279
and hey disk which is this green line at

1167
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,960
the bottom right the green line down

1168
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:03,839
here

1169
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,839
right that is makes it look like

1170
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,359
we should use disk right after zero

1171
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:12,240
years that seems like a right idea

1172
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:14,078
yeah after 25 years all of a sudden disc

1173
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:18,319
let's see here uh

1174
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:22,400
undo that disk moved up here

1175
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:23,520
right flash still very ssd flash still

1176
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:27,040
very expensive

1177
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:29,040
but now it looks like glass down here is

1178
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,480
going to win

1179
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,400
so we have to consider this when we do

1180
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,280
our models because the prices

1181
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:37,040
over time are going to change now that

1182
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,920
means our models are only as good as our

1183
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,640
predictions are

1184
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,320
of how the costs are going to change

1185
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,359
here's another example of something that

1186
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,599
we care a lot about

1187
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:47,040
something called a blast radius we know

1188
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,640
that failures are going to happen

1189
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,599
devices are going to fail and everything

1190
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,879
else is going to fail

1191
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:54,320
right how much data do you lose for

1192
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,079
failure

1193
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,599
right if i say that you have a one in a

1194
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,640
thousand chance or one in a million

1195
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,079
chance of failing

1196
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,520
right that's your annualized failure

1197
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,240
rate one in a million that sounds pretty

1198
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,920
good

1199
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,240
yeah one in a million chance you lose

1200
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,960
all your data the alexandria library

1201
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,640
burns down

1202
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,400
all of a sudden this is not a good thing

1203
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,720
is it what i

1204
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,760
care about is also the blast radius if

1205
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,839
something fails

1206
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,880
how much data do i lose well if i have

1207
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:18,480
three copies

1208
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,720
on three different continents by the way

1209
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,960
this is what the internet archive does

1210
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:26,000
i i want foreign i know they have two

1211
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,440
one of them incidentally in alexandria

1212
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,280
that means that if there's a big

1213
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,720
earthquake in san francisco and the

1214
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,599
archive goes away well we have

1215
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:35,919
alexandria left which is a good idea

1216
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:38,400
you want to try to make sure that a

1217
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,960
failure does not take down all your data

1218
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,200
you are probably better off with of

1219
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,480
quite a larger number of small losses

1220
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,240
because hey at least we'll have some

1221
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,240
plays by that playwright

1222
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,919
as opposed to one big loss getting rid

1223
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,040
of everything

1224
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,720
right and that's something that

1225
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,640
traditionally we don't think about with

1226
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,078
storage systems we assume we can keep

1227
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,960
all the data forever and that will be

1228
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:01,200
able to

1229
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:03,440
maybe we will maybe we won't

1230
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,598
okay so now let's talk about integrity

1231
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:08,000
and security how do we preserve the bits

1232
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:09,520
well first thing we need to do is ensure

1233
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,359
that the date that accidental

1234
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,079
modification oops i wrote that we can

1235
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:14,078
detect that

1236
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,599
that's not as bad because well nobody's

1237
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:17,440
trying really hard

1238
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:19,440
of course we have to also guard against

1239
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,359
intentional modification

1240
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,119
i'm hoping everyone here recognizes that

1241
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,000
photo right it's been a lot of memes

1242
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,400
recently

1243
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,040
that's a picture of uh stalin with uh

1244
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:32,079
nikolai yejov who apparently did not do

1245
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:34,240
well in the soviet regime because

1246
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:35,280
yeah that's what the picture looks like

1247
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,839
now

1248
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,760
notice he was erased you'd like to know

1249
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:41,440
that when that happens wouldn't you

1250
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,960
right that's the sort of thing you don't

1251
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,560
want to know about and given that this

1252
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,000
already happens quite a bit

1253
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,920
we assume it's going to continue to

1254
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,480
happen right

1255
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,480
so if it's going to continue to happen

1256
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,400
how do we prevent that from happening

1257
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,480
well one way was locks we mentioned

1258
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,160
earlier lots of copies keep stuff safe

1259
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,760
they spend a lot of time on a protocol

1260
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,520
to agree on what the right version

1261
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,920
should be

1262
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,599
of course it's also helpful to have

1263
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,359
mechanisms that prevent rewriting like

1264
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:09,520
let's say you have read-only media you

1265
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:10,720
can't rewrite on glass you can destroy

1266
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,599
it but at least you know it was

1267
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,200
destroyed

1268
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:14,960
here they had to make a separate copy of

1269
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,960
the photo i can't imagine they modified

1270
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,359
the original they didn't have photoshop

1271
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,680
did a pretty good job though now for

1272
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:23,920
security you also want to know

1273
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,919
that only authorized readers can

1274
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,760
authorize users can read the data

1275
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,119
you can't depend on a key because what

1276
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,560
happens if the key is unavailable

1277
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:32,640
nobody can read the data even if they're

1278
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,839
authorized what if the key is leaked

1279
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,400
what doesn't sound so bad just

1280
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:38,400
re-encrypt the data re-encrypt all

1281
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,079
exabytes worth of data yeah that's not

1282
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,160
happening

1283
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:44,000
and it's not just leaked keys it's also

1284
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,759
cryptographic obsolescence

1285
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,599
okay you've got to be resistant to slow

1286
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,160
attacks as well attacks that can take

1287
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:50,960
20 years why well i can think of some

1288
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,480
people who might

1289
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,400
might like to get our nuclear secrets

1290
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,680
even if it takes them 20 years to do it

1291
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,200
i can think that there are people who

1292
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,879
might want that

1293
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,040
that's not something we plan for very

1294
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,280
much 20 years means

1295
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:07,119
a long time things like oh look for all

1296
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:09,440
the activity what activity was 20 years

1297
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:11,119
okay so one example solution is a

1298
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,280
project that we did at uc santa cruz

1299
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:14,720
this is published in usenix atc back in

1300
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,440
2007

1301
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:19,439
and that is pot shards the idea here is

1302
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,480
secret split data across archives so you

1303
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,920
take your data

1304
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,680
and you secret split it this is

1305
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,400
information theoretic secure and you

1306
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,279
send one

1307
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,079
comp one part of each thing one shard to

1308
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,720
each of

1309
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:32,880
in this case four archives now the

1310
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,480
archive provides shards only after you

1311
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,000
authenticate to that archive we didn't

1312
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,079
say how you authenticate the answer is

1313
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,079
just prove you are who you say you are

1314
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:41,520
if it takes a court order and a photo id

1315
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,960
they'll just hand you the shards we

1316
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,280
didn't make it so that you have to tell

1317
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,160
them

1318
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:48,000
how to do it the user knows which shards

1319
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,040
go together and how to go get the shards

1320
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,440
they need

1321
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,880
so s but the thing is that what happens

1322
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,560
if you forget the key what if you forget

1323
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,319
the key if the user who's authorized

1324
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,078
goes away and it's the user's errors

1325
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:59,119
that say look i can prove i'm allowed to

1326
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,240
have this data

1327
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:03,359
but i don't know which pieces go

1328
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:05,359
together the answer

1329
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:08,640
anyone who gets all of the shards in

1330
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:12,160
this case by all the shards i mean

1331
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:13,200
this this this and this if you get all

1332
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,640
four of them

1333
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,560
you can determine how they fit together

1334
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:19,759
in fact if you get all of these

1335
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:21,520
all of these all these and all these

1336
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,800
you can also determine how they fit

1337
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,800
together even if you didn't know those

1338
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:29,200
four went together specifically

1339
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:30,319
but if you only have one archive let's

1340
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,640
say you compromise

1341
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:34,640
archive three if you only have this you

1342
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:37,359
have no way of knowing

1343
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,960
that this shard goes with this shard you

1344
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:41,839
don't know what shard it goes with

1345
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,200
you can't steal them now why is this

1346
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,880
important well

1347
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,480
we assumed you didn't compromise all the

1348
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,000
archives after all someone with infinite

1349
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,960
power could pretty much do what they

1350
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,520
want

1351
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,800
but if you only compromise one archive

1352
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,560
that i believe you can do

1353
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,880
you're no closer to getting the data

1354
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:58,000
back we need to have something like this

1355
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,400
for archival storage

1356
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,079
we want to have a balance between it's

1357
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,920
hard to get the data back

1358
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,680
but it's easy if you can get all of the

1359
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,640
information and actually legally collect

1360
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,560
everything

1361
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:12,720
that's a trade-off you have to make for

1362
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:15,359
archival storage

1363
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,560
so let's talk briefly about archival

1364
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:20,000
storage projects

1365
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,400
okay uh i don't have a lot of time to go

1366
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,160
into

1367
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,839
all of the gory low-level details on

1368
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,279
each one of these but i can talk briefly

1369
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:26,799
about several projects

1370
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,319
so the first one of these is the main

1371
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,040
project at the university of colorado

1372
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,800
and by the way

1373
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,400
that's made marion you would be amazed

1374
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,640
at how hard it is to find a picture of a

1375
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:37,040
maid that that actually is reasonable

1376
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:39,440
made marrying i figure it's pretty safe

1377
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:41,759
so made is a massive array of idle disks

1378
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,520
and it introduced the use of idle disks

1379
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:46,720
spinning disks down to save

1380
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:48,400
power all right the idea here is that if

1381
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,520
you save power you spin them back up

1382
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,040
spin them down you can look at

1383
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,759
reliability you can look at power

1384
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,720
savings

1385
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,599
this is a really good idea the next

1386
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,839
project was something

1387
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,960
some work that we did in 2008 called

1388
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:00,078
pergamum

1389
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,680
and that would be the picture on the

1390
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:03,200
upper left that's the old library at

1391
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,480
pergamum it was the second largest

1392
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,160
library in the ancient world and

1393
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,040
actually managed the transition from

1394
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,359
papyrus

1395
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:11,040
to parchment the reason being papyrus

1396
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:12,960
and alexandria hey grows in the

1397
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,400
papyrus reed grows in the nile that was

1398
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,839
easy you move to

1399
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,280
turkey which is where pergamum is and

1400
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:19,920
all of a sudden yeah it's hard to get

1401
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,440
papyrus so they switched to parchment

1402
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,040
the pergamum system was incrementally

1403
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,520
scalable and evolvable it had these

1404
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:27,359
independent nodes which we called tomes

1405
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:29,599
each one of them was a self-contained

1406
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:31,119
disk and a cpu

1407
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:33,119
and a network interface a little bit of

1408
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:35,280
memory so they all work together to be

1409
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,800
reliable to maintain integrity

1410
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,720
and we developed some of the algorithms

1411
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,000
for this now

1412
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,520
there are two other projects that are

1413
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,119
very important because they're real

1414
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:45,040
world implementations

1415
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:46,640
first one is pelican and that's a nice

1416
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,119
picture of pelicans in santa cruz in

1417
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,799
fact

1418
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:50,720
if you remember the opening shot of a

1419
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,400
natural bridge those pelicans are

1420
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,240
sitting on top of the natural bridge

1421
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,440
can't see that i cut i made the pelicans

1422
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:58,160
bigger

1423
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,359
but they did a real world implementation

1424
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,799
which is great

1425
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:02,400
they solved a lot of difficult

1426
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,240
engineering issues for example

1427
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,760
power load management how do you make

1428
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,839
sure that you know you supply limited

1429
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,319
power spin up only a few discs at a time

1430
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:09,520
and

1431
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:12,160
make sure that they're not on the same

1432
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:13,599
power line this is really hard stuff

1433
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,598
they had they dealt with real world

1434
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:17,440
networking issues okay we have a limited

1435
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:19,119
bandwidth how do we reduce the bandwidth

1436
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,160
because if we don't we can't rebuild

1437
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:24,240
anything

1438
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:25,839
they improved eccs they uh they used um

1439
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:28,160
locally repairable codes to reduce

1440
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:29,599
bandwidth for doing reconstruction

1441
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,520
they did a lot of nice things but the

1442
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:32,400
big one is they built it they built a

1443
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:35,280
real world thing

1444
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,920
we didn't have the resources to do that

1445
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,280
the second

1446
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:40,079
the second project i want to mention

1447
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,680
also osdi 2014 is f4 and by the way

1448
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:42,319
facebook guys if you want a nice picture

1449
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:46,319
like this

1450
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:48,880
use a better name than f4 f4 come on

1451
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:50,160
haystack was okay f4 you get an f4 on

1452
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,920
the page

1453
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,920
this is storage for warm data so the

1454
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,520
idea was you had a high-ish access rate

1455
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,359
because this is where you put all those

1456
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:59,040
old photos and videos and everything

1457
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:00,400
else you upload to facebook

1458
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,079
it was getting expensive to store them

1459
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,720
in haystacks they said how do we store

1460
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:06,800
warm data we want low-cost and long-term

1461
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:08,480
storage but the access rate is pretty

1462
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,280
high and unfortunately not necessarily

1463
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,560
predictable

1464
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,400
but they looked at building a system

1465
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,520
that way and how likely it was to do the

1466
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,040
accesses so

1467
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:17,599
that was another very interesting

1468
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:20,960
project that people want to look at

1469
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:23,760
okay all right so

1470
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,760
the next thing is

1471
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:30,079
preserving the meaning of data okay

1472
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:31,599
now digital data may not have an obvious

1473
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:32,960
meaning because while some data is

1474
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:34,160
relatively simple to interpret like

1475
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,560
ascii text

1476
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:38,879
small page telling what each code means

1477
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:41,200
gif is only 33 pages long

1478
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,040
jpeg is worse and then we're not even

1479
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,319
going to talk about mp4

1480
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,480
okay we're not going to talk about

1481
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:47,520
postscript and pdf which are interpreted

1482
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,960
languages

1483
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,359
i don't know about everybody here but

1484
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:55,200
i've actually gotten papers to review

1485
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:58,000
that didn't open in pdf on my laptop

1486
00:46:55,200 --> 00:47:00,000
why because someone made the mistake of

1487
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,079
drawing a graph with two million points

1488
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,280
you know each one's a little dot and

1489
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:04,960
they drop they drew

1490
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,440
all two million points it turns out when

1491
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:10,079
you do that some interpreters choke

1492
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:11,520
literally okay that's a problem gee

1493
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,000
worked on the old one why not on the new

1494
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,400
one

1495
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,680
microsoft word microsoft excel right

1496
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,040
that's also hard

1497
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:19,279
yes i know their move they've moved to

1498
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:21,759
ex to xml but

1499
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:23,280
well uh you know even there somewhat

1500
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,520
hard to do and of course good luck with

1501
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:27,119
things like word perfect documents

1502
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,800
right if you have a wordperfect one

1503
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:31,680
document um my

1504
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,559
mother actually uh who's a who's a rabbi

1505
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,078
recorder

1506
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:35,680
wrote her sermons in an early version of

1507
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:36,400
word perfect from you know the from the

1508
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,319
90s

1509
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,800
and asked me so ethan how do i get the

1510
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:42,800
sermons back

1511
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,240
word perfect doesn't exist anywhere you

1512
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,440
know that i could get it

1513
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,640
heck it was such an old version that

1514
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,240
even i think the latest versions of

1515
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:52,240
wordperfect couldn't read them

1516
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:53,598
thankfully open office could but that's

1517
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:57,359
that's about all i had

1518
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:59,520
okay um the thing is that

1519
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:00,720
standards change over time and it gets

1520
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,599
even worse if you're talking about

1521
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,680
executables

1522
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:05,359
like a video game or something that's

1523
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,040
cross-linked with other objects so if

1524
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:08,558
you build your presentation and embed

1525
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:10,079
the the graphics you're good

1526
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:11,760
but what happens if the graphics are all

1527
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:13,520
linked to things on your on your disk

1528
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:16,640
and you try to store it

1529
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:18,079
now you're out of luck this is a big

1530
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:20,319
challenge i don't have time to talk more

1531
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:23,280
about it but it's a very big challenge

1532
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:25,119
okay now this is in response to tony

1533
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:27,520
mason's question about search

1534
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:28,800
because that's a really good question of

1535
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:32,400
course search matters

1536
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:33,920
right um the analog data

1537
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,359
turns out there's not a lot of it and

1538
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,440
there's not much searching but that's

1539
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:38,720
why we had card catalogs and librarians

1540
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,800
and everything else

1541
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:43,040
digital data is much bigger and here's

1542
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:45,359
where a problem comes in

1543
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:47,279
okay let's say i i want it to be

1544
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:50,400
efficient and scalable

1545
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:52,400
i don't want to use a single large index

1546
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,400
because what happens when that index

1547
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,599
fails i said when not if because it will

1548
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,160
fail

1549
00:48:55,599 --> 00:49:00,079
well if i had 10 million media the only

1550
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,200
way to rebuild the index is to read all

1551
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:03,680
10 million media

1552
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,640
every single thing is offline until that

1553
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:08,558
happens

1554
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:11,598
okay this is bad so on the top

1555
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:14,720
right okay

1556
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:17,119
on the top i've got one big index

1557
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:18,879
and it indexes everything well if i if i

1558
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:21,040
if that index fails

1559
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,480
i've got to re-read every one of these

1560
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:25,359
and re-index all of them all

1561
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:27,280
10 million of them okay if i want to

1562
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:28,480
re-index an exabyte of data it's gonna

1563
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:31,280
be a little while

1564
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,319
it'll take me a bit so what i want to do

1565
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:35,119
instead

1566
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:36,319
is build an index that can be increment

1567
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:39,520
that can be

1568
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:41,920
aggregated so that i have one index

1569
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:43,520
on each device that index only worries

1570
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,000
about that device if that index fails i

1571
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,240
can rebuild

1572
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,680
it just by reading the device and the

1573
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:49,598
rest of the archive is available

1574
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:51,839
right now this is kind you might say

1575
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:54,720
yeah this is kind of like slicing well

1576
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:56,240
sort of the thing with slices is if you

1577
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:58,000
slice stuff you can be efficient about

1578
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,200
what about deciding what goes into which

1579
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,680
slice

1580
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:03,919
problem is here you don't know what's on

1581
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:05,359
each archive media it could be randomly

1582
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,000
determined it could have been built over

1583
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:07,839
time

1584
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,599
the index has to cross all of those and

1585
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:11,520
that's why we think

1586
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:12,720
having a self-contained media index

1587
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:15,359
seems like a better idea

1588
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:17,759
it's more reliable and now we can search

1589
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:20,400
it by using an aggregator sorry the word

1590
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,880
the letter r got taken off when i ran

1591
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,079
this on

1592
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:26,400
keynote on my ipad

1593
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:27,839
okay so one way that you could do this

1594
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,440
is a project called dawn that we did

1595
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:31,599
which we based on fawn that was the

1596
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:34,240
flexible array of wimpy nodes from cmu

1597
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:36,240
we have a durable array of wimpy nodes

1598
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:38,000
and this project the idea here is and

1599
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,680
this hasn't gone very far so i encourage

1600
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,520
people to take the idea

1601
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:45,759
large number of um pergamum-like tomes

1602
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:47,359
that only use nvm very low power

1603
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:49,280
leave the failed devices in place we

1604
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:50,000
have a commodity gigabit ethernet

1605
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,760
network

1606
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,359
we run queries in the background that's

1607
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:56,079
the key idea here

1608
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:57,520
in the background you say look maybe you

1609
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:58,960
should look through your data for these

1610
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:00,640
queries i don't need the answer right

1611
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,640
now but maybe we could look through it

1612
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,680
and get the query in a week or two and

1613
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,359
you could tell us something interesting

1614
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:07,759
about this genetic data or

1615
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:09,839
sensor data or something else medical

1616
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:11,040
data societal data big data for science

1617
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:11,920
all of those are going to be kind of

1618
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:15,440
useful

1619
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:18,480
okay all right

1620
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:20,160
so summary here is

1621
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:21,760
that the challenges that we're going to

1622
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,640
have in preserving data for the long

1623
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,960
term

1624
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:27,118
first one is how do we archive 10 to the

1625
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:29,280
18th bits reliability and integrity

1626
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:30,640
indexing and searching scalability and

1627
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,160
management

1628
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,839
we want to ensure we can actually get

1629
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:35,598
the bits back in decades but we also

1630
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:37,920
want to get value from the stored data

1631
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:39,440
to help us pay for keeping it otherwise

1632
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,960
you have this thing where who's going to

1633
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,559
pay for it right

1634
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:44,319
we want to integrate all of these

1635
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:45,599
solutions into a system that can survive

1636
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:47,359
for a century or more

1637
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:49,200
right it's a very difficult challenge

1638
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:52,240
and it's going to involve it's going to

1639
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,799
involve evolution over time right it's

1640
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,000
going to involve

1641
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,319
issues of economics as well as

1642
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,079
technology and that's why

1643
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:59,359
economics is one of the slides one of

1644
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,559
the things we spent time on

1645
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:02,480
that's great if we know how to build it

1646
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:03,760
but nobody's going to pay for it how are

1647
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:06,240
you going to do this make it

1648
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:07,760
useful make it so that keeping the data

1649
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:10,479
is worthwhile

1650
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:12,160
okay so that i want to finish up and

1651
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,680
i'll answer the questions online in a

1652
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:16,319
minute

1653
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:18,000
first thing is long-term digital

1654
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:20,000
preservation is really important

1655
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,280
because the fate of all the world's data

1656
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,359
is at stake

1657
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:25,119
the problem isn't going away in fact

1658
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:27,680
it's getting worse fast because

1659
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:30,000
we don't think about what it means to

1660
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:31,520
keep data around forever

1661
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,040
we just don't think about it i mean look

1662
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,480
if you get someone to think five years

1663
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,800
out you're doing really well

1664
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:38,640
we gotta think a hundred years out and

1665
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,079
not just i built the system it'll last a

1666
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,359
hundred years no it won't

1667
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:42,960
it's like saying i built a house it'll

1668
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:43,598
last a hundred years you gotta maintain

1669
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,960
it

1670
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:46,559
okay when that when the house i'm in

1671
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,000
right now is built they didn't have

1672
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:48,800
ethernet so i had to have someone run

1673
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,720
ethernet

1674
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,839
they didn't have smart light switches so

1675
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:53,598
i had to replace them i didn't have to

1676
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:55,520
replace all the wiring to replace the

1677
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:56,880
smart light switches thankfully

1678
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,800
but that's what we got to think about

1679
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,800
for storage systems

1680
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,079
we've also got to stop thinking ad hoc

1681
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,480
oh i fixed problem a and b

1682
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:05,440
yeah but all the other problems we can't

1683
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:07,200
do that

1684
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:09,200
there are a lot of problems left to be

1685
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:11,598
solved a lot of good systems research

1686
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:13,279
that i'm looking forward to seeing

1687
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:15,040
as people take on the challenges that i

1688
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,480
presented today right

1689
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:18,079
but one of the things i want i want to

1690
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,760
say here is that if you have a good

1691
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:21,599
product a good research thing there is a

1692
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:24,960
huge potential for impact

1693
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:27,040
okay people need this stuff and if you

1694
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,680
get good ideas people are going to use

1695
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,279
it

1696
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:30,960
one thing i do want to stress is that

1697
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,559
integrating some level of processing

1698
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:34,559
with archive is likely to be a win and

1699
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:35,680
by the way that's one thing where glass

1700
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:37,920
doesn't do well

1701
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:39,598
glass is you know sits off on the side

1702
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:41,359
it's really reliable and all that stuff

1703
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:42,800
but you got to read it to process it

1704
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:45,040
flash you don't

1705
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,160
disk you don't maybe integrating that is

1706
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:47,920
how you can make

1707
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:50,078
more active media more expensive in

1708
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:51,520
terms of operational expenses

1709
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:53,359
maybe that's how you can make those more

1710
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:55,040
viable hey you can do processing on them

1711
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:56,799
you can't do it on glass

1712
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:58,079
maybe it's some combination of both

1713
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:00,480
right

1714
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:02,079
so with that i'm going to finish up and

1715
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:05,040
thank people for their for their help

1716
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:06,319
james byron and everybody else's crss uh

1717
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:08,240
some of the ideas here came from

1718
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:08,640
discussions with at with aaron zadok and

1719
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:11,200
others

1720
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:12,799
at the banbury workshop and dna storage

1721
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,240
in 2019

1722
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:16,319
and with that i'm happy to take

1723
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:19,439
questions

1724
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:22,400
thank you very much ethan clap clap clap

1725
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:23,280
um there's a number of uh questions on

1726
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,800
slack

1727
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,240
if you want to sort of pick them off if

1728
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,880
you're there or i can read them off for

1729
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,240
you

1730
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:30,000
whatever whatever works better for you

1731
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:32,399
guys i i can read them or you can read

1732
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:35,599
them that's up to you

1733
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:37,599
okay so uh let me uh

1734
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:38,640
in no particular order there's some

1735
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:42,799
questions about

1736
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:46,240
uh durability one question from

1737
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:48,880
umesh wari is why durability is not one

1738
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:50,720
of the spokes on the radar chart

1739
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:52,000
also for flash wise durability

1740
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:54,319
characterizes unknown

1741
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,760
probably long when it is known to have

1742
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:58,880
limited retention

1743
00:54:55,760 --> 00:55:01,680
at most few years without refresh and

1744
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:02,960
i would just add to that that i i'm also

1745
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:05,680
curious

1746
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:08,240
don't we have to consider environmental

1747
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:11,680
conditions for durability like uh

1748
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:13,839
vibration radiation humidity etc right

1749
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:15,520
so the reason that i had that i didn't

1750
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:17,440
do a spoke for durability is that

1751
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:19,280
durability is a little more complex than

1752
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:21,200
i think you're making it out to be

1753
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:23,119
here's the reason you are absolutely

1754
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,000
right the retention on flash is low

1755
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:26,480
meaning that

1756
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,480
the flash will not retain the charge for

1757
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:29,359
a a very long time umesh is absolutely

1758
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:32,000
right about that

1759
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:32,558
but here's the important thing let's say

1760
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,720
that

1761
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:36,960
that once every three months let's say

1762
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:38,640
retention i know to be about a year

1763
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:40,000
every three months i go through and i

1764
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:42,160
just spend a little bit of power

1765
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,040
rewrite the flash re recharge the

1766
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:46,480
capacitors

1767
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:49,119
right if i do that the flash media

1768
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:51,040
itself will last for 20 years

1769
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:53,440
okay so in other words that now gets

1770
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:55,040
folded into operating expense instead of

1771
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:56,640
i gotta buy more flash

1772
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:58,400
now compare that with something like a

1773
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,598
disk where when a disk hits five to

1774
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,119
seven years old

1775
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:02,720
if you leave your data on it and don't

1776
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:03,520
replace the disk you are playing with

1777
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:05,279
fire

1778
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:07,440
not much you can do to say oh but can i

1779
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:09,440
please refresh the mechanics on the disk

1780
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:11,119
not going to work that's why we don't

1781
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:12,720
have an explicit thing for durability

1782
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:14,640
why it's listed as operating expense

1783
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:16,720
instead of durability because

1784
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:18,879
durability is how long will a medium

1785
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,598
last if i if i if i want to keep using

1786
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,200
it

1787
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:22,960
independent of what do i have to do to

1788
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:25,279
keep using it do i have to

1789
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,799
as umesh said do i have to rewrite it

1790
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:28,880
you know once i rewrite it is the flag

1791
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:30,400
to be good again for another year yes

1792
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:32,240
so i just do that every three months and

1793
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:34,079
i'm in good shape so it's a little more

1794
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:36,799
complex than that

1795
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:37,520
okay um and that's why i characterize

1796
00:56:36,799 --> 00:56:39,440
flash

1797
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:41,599
as an unknown probably long as it's how

1798
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:43,119
long will the flash physically last

1799
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:45,440
if i'm willing to pay attention to it

1800
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:47,440
every so often right

1801
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:48,640
now the second thing that the second

1802
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,960
question you were asking

1803
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:52,558
is uh you know durability versus

1804
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,079
reliability um

1805
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:56,079
you know and i see craig you asked this

1806
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:57,520
question also which i'll i'll try to you

1807
00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:00,000
know try to try to answer

1808
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,880
right that's a really good point

1809
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,280
durability

1810
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:04,960
reliability complexity of reader devices

1811
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,319
is a really important thing for long

1812
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,960
term storage and we did mention it

1813
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:10,400
briefly

1814
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:12,160
right so the thing about that is

1815
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:14,000
glass is cheap readers could be

1816
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:15,680
proprietary and expensive but the nice

1817
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,359
thing about glass and by the way optical

1818
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:20,240
media is the same way

1819
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:21,440
you can read it optically you can read

1820
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,879
it with a microscope

1821
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:24,799
now i'm not saying you can understand

1822
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:26,799
with the bit speed but apparently

1823
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:28,720
a sufficiently good microscope is enough

1824
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:29,440
to be able to read the data engraved in

1825
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,879
glass

1826
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,240
i did say sufficiently good but it

1827
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,760
doesn't have to be a specialized

1828
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:36,640
microscope as far as i know

1829
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:38,079
okay in other words reading is much less

1830
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:40,720
as it turns out technically

1831
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:41,200
easy sorry much technically easier not

1832
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,040
less

1833
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:44,558
it's much easier to read glass than it

1834
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:46,319
is to write writing it involves

1835
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:47,839
femtosecond lasers

1836
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:49,440
i'm not a physicist i'm not gonna try to

1837
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:51,040
explain it but it involves

1838
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:53,359
much more advanced technology than the

1839
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:54,079
readers that's a good sign it's very

1840
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:56,480
good when the

1841
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:58,400
reading is much simpler than the writing

1842
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:00,480
by the way that's also true for dna

1843
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:03,200
we've known how to read dna for a really

1844
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:06,400
long time we can do it really cheaply

1845
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:07,200
on the other hand writing dna oh god

1846
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,200
that's hard

1847
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:10,240
that's really the big problem with dna

1848
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:13,359
is writing it because

1849
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:15,839
writing it is expensive and slow

1850
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:17,839
bandwidth wise that has to improve

1851
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:19,440
dramatically because i could use dna and

1852
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:20,720
say look i'll store all the data on dna

1853
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:22,720
i don't plan to read much of it if you

1854
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:24,319
want to read it you pay the money

1855
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:26,720
that works well but when the writing is

1856
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:28,240
expensive i can't afford that

1857
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:30,799
that's why it's so important to make

1858
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:31,839
writing cheap much more so than reading

1859
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:32,720
and that's an interesting kind of

1860
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:34,480
comment there

1861
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:36,000
okay so hopefully that answered a

1862
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:39,359
message's question if not ask another

1863
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,839
question okay good uh there's another

1864
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:43,040
question

1865
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:46,160
from uh tony mason that's been

1866
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:46,480
echoed by others how do we find specific

1867
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,240
thing

1868
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:50,240
in an ocean of data in particular the

1869
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:50,640
search problem is real now where we're

1870
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,919
trying

1871
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,680
we're having a hard time finding

1872
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:55,680
absolutely what we have in our

1873
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:56,879
online drives and even if on local

1874
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:59,118
drives oh

1875
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:00,079
absolutely in fact remember i said that

1876
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:01,359
this is challenges

1877
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:03,599
if i knew how to do this it wouldn't be

1878
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:04,558
a challenge i think the solution is

1879
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:08,480
going to have to be

1880
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:10,880
some form of localized

1881
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:12,559
search where each device each medium

1882
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,160
each clump of stuff

1883
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:15,920
does its own searching and then sends

1884
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:17,440
the results off to an aggregator perhaps

1885
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,640
with something saying you're probably

1886
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:20,640
not here

1887
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:22,240
the reason is that and this goes to the

1888
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,040
concept of blast radius i know someone

1889
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,160
else has

1890
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:27,440
asked about that we'll talk about that

1891
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:29,118
in a minute if you have a single index

1892
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:31,440
and it fails you have to read an

1893
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:32,559
awful lot of data to fix it on the other

1894
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:34,720
hand if you have

1895
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:36,559
an index for each device well okay this

1896
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:38,319
device failed okay well come on the

1897
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:40,160
data's gone anyway or the index failed

1898
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:42,960
the device is fine okay re-read the

1899
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:44,720
the data for that one thing you can't

1900
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:47,839
afford to re-read everything

1901
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:49,359
you just can't and because of that

1902
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:50,640
this is you know put your egg all your

1903
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:52,319
eggs in one basket and really watch the

1904
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,799
basket the problem is if the basket

1905
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:55,200
holds

1906
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:56,640
100 million eggs and you drop it that's

1907
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:58,078
a big omelet

1908
00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:01,200
and it's one that will take a really

1909
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:04,319
long time to fix you don't want that

1910
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:05,598
what you want instead is something where

1911
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:07,440
you have

1912
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:09,119
a drive and an index for that drive so

1913
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,839
you can ask it i'm looking for x do you

1914
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:11,760
have it

1915
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:13,359
yes i do no i don't well that's an easy

1916
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:14,559
question to ask and you ask it of 10

1917
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:15,839
million devices

1918
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:17,280
hopefully using some kind of a

1919
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:18,240
hierarchical mechanism so you don't have

1920
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,400
to ask all

1921
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:21,919
10 million devices on every query

1922
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,520
something like bloom filters

1923
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:25,440
or a higher level index that gives you

1924
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:27,280
an idea yeah it's probably in these guys

1925
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:29,680
and probably not in those guys

1926
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:31,599
so some levels summaries of summaries of

1927
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:33,200
summaries something like that

1928
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:34,480
anything else isn't going to scale and

1929
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:36,319
it's going to be really terrible to deal

1930
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,640
with when failure happens and yes i did

1931
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:39,359
say

1932
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:39,359
when it happens

1933
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:46,480
okay uh one other thing that i think i

1934
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:49,839
noticed in the radar chart

1935
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:50,559
uh that a superimposed one it sort of

1936
01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:53,599
seems like

1937
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:56,000
hard disk is not really excelling in any

1938
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:58,960
particular thing

1939
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,319
does this predict doom for it and i

1940
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:02,079
hesitate saying it because

1941
01:01:00,319 --> 01:01:03,359
people have been predicting doom for

1942
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:05,280
tape for decades

1943
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:06,480
no no that's actually excellent question

1944
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:09,520
and the answer is

1945
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:10,160
not necessarily okay here's the reason

1946
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:11,599
why and

1947
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:13,440
i brought the slide for you this is the

1948
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:14,880
futures and again this is a guess here

1949
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:16,880
but here's the reason why it might not

1950
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:18,559
be doomed for it okay

1951
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:20,799
if you look at this chart you look and

1952
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:22,000
see all right flash beats hard disk in

1953
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:25,839
almost everything

1954
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:30,079
okay if you look over here right

1955
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:33,839
flash beats hard disk here here here

1956
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:37,040
um here and

1957
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:39,119
here notice there's one place where

1958
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:42,799
flash does where flash loses

1959
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:42,799
badly to hard disk and where is that

1960
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,240
right there now what this means is flash

1961
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:49,680
beats the crap out of disk if you're

1962
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:52,959
willing to spend

1963
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:54,960
10 20 times as much sure right flash

1964
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:55,920
wins really nicely if you can afford to

1965
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:58,400
pay for it

1966
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:00,079
right that's the thing to kee that's the

1967
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:03,520
key thing to remember is

1968
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:05,760
the issue is we not we can't

1969
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:07,359
we don't want to pay a lot of money so a

1970
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:09,200
jack-of-all-trades like disc may

1971
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:11,440
actually win because look

1972
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:12,799
it's not the best at anything but it's

1973
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:14,240
good enough at everything and it's

1974
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:16,640
cheaper

1975
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:17,919
okay that may mean that something like

1976
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:21,359
disc wins

1977
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:22,720
that'd be kind of good wouldn't it right

1978
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:24,319
that's something to think about and

1979
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:26,240
that's why i think that it's not the

1980
01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:27,440
case that disk may automatically go away

1981
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:31,839
because

1982
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:33,200
disk is not the most expensive

1983
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:35,119
right that's the key thing to think

1984
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:36,640
about here okay

1985
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:38,640
so does that help does that help to

1986
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:39,920
answer your question yeah but perhaps

1987
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:42,319
this uh

1988
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:43,280
further justifies uh research into

1989
01:02:42,319 --> 01:02:44,799
hybrids

1990
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:47,119
trying to get sort of the best of both

1991
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:48,240
worlds because this shows where is the

1992
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:49,920
best uh

1993
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:51,359
point for in on various dimensions

1994
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:52,559
that's different technologies that's

1995
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:53,759
right i mean what you might do for a

1996
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:55,680
hybrid is say well

1997
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:57,119
let's say the glass becomes viable maybe

1998
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:58,720
you know glass looks really good

1999
01:02:57,119 --> 01:03:00,240
that would be the the red thing over

2000
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:01,439
here that's this line right

2001
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:03,919
glass looks like it's really good in

2002
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:06,400
everything except for performance

2003
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:07,680
right it's not so good there but flash

2004
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:10,079
is really good in performance maybe

2005
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:12,799
hybrid of between flash and glass

2006
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:13,760
there's only one small problem with that

2007
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:17,038
the one thing

2008
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:18,000
that you cannot fake that you can't get

2009
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:22,079
around

2010
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:22,079
is this whoops

2011
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:28,480
that you can't escape it okay

2012
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:30,640
now what you can do is say is paralyze

2013
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:31,440
it okay look so glass if you notice is

2014
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:34,879
pretty far

2015
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:36,400
down on the the axis on that right

2016
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:37,839
the only way to get around that is let's

2017
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:39,280
buy lots of writers but of course if you

2018
01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:40,400
buy lots of writers that's going to

2019
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:42,319
increase your capital

2020
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:44,079
your capital expense that's going to

2021
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:44,640
increase your operating expense things

2022
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:45,760
like that

2023
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:47,839
but that's the you know that's going to

2024
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:49,359
increase your infrastructure cost

2025
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:50,558
but that's how you have to do it right

2026
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:52,400
that's what this is going to be is a

2027
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:54,559
bunch of optimizations and how you make

2028
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,559
them

2029
01:03:55,200 --> 01:04:01,279
cool cool um let's see gala

2030
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:02,799
uh yadgar had an interesting comment

2031
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:05,920
that says basically

2032
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:06,799
uh maybe 2000 years later there will be

2033
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:09,280
information that

2034
01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:10,480
is not worth preserving and i think that

2035
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:13,520
maybe brings up a

2036
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:15,119
a high level point about retention and

2037
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:16,319
certain things that we want to forget

2038
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:19,599
after a certain point

2039
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:21,119
in time maybe we even have to right so

2040
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:22,720
the answer is yeah there are certainly

2041
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:24,160
things that you might want to have that

2042
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,959
you might want to forget after a period

2043
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,799
in time and

2044
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:28,799
one of the big problems that people have

2045
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:30,079
is there is nothing you can do to say

2046
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:31,920
i'm going to guarantee to forget it

2047
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:33,440
other than to do it in such a way that

2048
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:34,559
natural bit rot makes it go away

2049
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:36,079
eventually there was a project the

2050
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:36,880
university of washington whose name i'd

2051
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:39,280
forgotten

2052
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:40,000
that was looking at this see brain

2053
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:42,880
actually makes

2054
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,240
it makes bits go away right so um the

2055
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:45,680
point here is that there are techniques

2056
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:47,598
for doing that but they're not explicit

2057
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:48,558
there's no explicit notion of time in a

2058
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:49,760
computer

2059
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:51,440
right because if you're concerned about

2060
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:52,079
security the answer is i ignore your

2061
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:54,640
time and

2062
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:55,839
we're done so what you're saying here is

2063
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:57,440
how do we know what people are going to

2064
01:04:55,839 --> 01:04:58,319
want to keep in the future we have no

2065
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:00,079
idea

2066
01:04:58,319 --> 01:05:02,400
i'll give you an example right if you

2067
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:04,559
had asked me

2068
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:06,319
20 years ago would it be important to

2069
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:08,799
keep childhood photos

2070
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:10,000
of a of a of a mixed-race kid you know

2071
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:11,920
white mother black father

2072
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,440
living in hawaii if you would ask me 20

2073
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:15,119
years ago how important is to keep those

2074
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:16,640
pictures the answer is oh

2075
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:18,720
well okay if the kid's name is barack

2076
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:21,038
obama does that change your opinion

2077
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:22,640
right we didn't know that back in the

2078
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:23,839
60s and 70s we had no idea the kid was

2079
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:25,279
going to be president

2080
01:05:23,839 --> 01:05:26,960
now it could have been any kid it

2081
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:28,559
happened to be him do we now have to

2082
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:30,400
keep all those photos just in case

2083
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:33,359
somebody becomes president

2084
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:34,480
right that's kind of the problem you see

2085
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:35,598
what i'm saying here so

2086
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:37,520
we don't know what's going to be

2087
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:38,640
important i mean things like garbage

2088
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:39,839
heaps middens

2089
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:42,078
are tremendously important to

2090
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:43,839
archaeologists and that's the stuff that

2091
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:45,039
people 2000 years ago not only did they

2092
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:46,240
think it wasn't value but they thought

2093
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:48,559
it was trash

2094
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:50,160
we think it's really valuable so we

2095
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:52,720
don't know this stuff

2096
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:53,440
okay so hopefully that answered the

2097
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:55,279
question we

2098
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:57,039
we can't tell what people in the future

2099
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:58,400
are going to need we can

2100
01:05:57,039 --> 01:05:59,839
certainly say all right these three

2101
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:01,359
pictures are almost identical get rid of

2102
01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:02,640
two of them that we can probably do but

2103
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:04,480
beyond that

2104
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:06,000
all we can do is have people assign

2105
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:07,520
value and to the extent that it takes

2106
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,960
time to do that

2107
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:11,038
it's it's something that's going to be

2108
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:12,559
very difficult uh james hughes one of

2109
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:14,599
our grad students has done some work on

2110
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:17,839
this it was published in mascots

2111
01:06:14,599 --> 01:06:19,200
2018 i believe i can post a link to that

2112
01:06:17,839 --> 01:06:19,680
i'll put a link to that on the slack

2113
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:23,279
channel

2114
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:27,118
after i'm done thank you

2115
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:30,079
um the next question i see comes from

2116
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:32,160
sarah bakchi he says in line with hybrid

2117
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:33,680
idea can you speak to the challenges

2118
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:35,359
of the following approach keep the

2119
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:37,118
frequently accessed valuable data in

2120
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:37,759
high call storage and the others and low

2121
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:39,599
cost

2122
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:41,280
ones hard disk revisit the data

2123
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:42,720
characteristic periodically and move

2124
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:44,960
them around which means that

2125
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:47,200
yeah maybe the archive is not so static

2126
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:48,720
it's it's a bit more dynamic in nature

2127
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:50,480
so really that what you're really doing

2128
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:52,799
there first of all you keep the data the

2129
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:54,640
you keep all of it in the archive okay

2130
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:56,000
there's no value to taking something

2131
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:57,598
that's going to be used frequently and

2132
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,119
pulling and deleting it from the archive

2133
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:00,720
when it becomes used frequently you just

2134
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:03,599
cache it and flash

2135
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:05,919
this problem so syrah this problem is

2136
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:08,799
incredibly old old enough that

2137
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:10,880
um it was actually part of my master's

2138
01:07:08,799 --> 01:07:12,640
thesis in the early 90s

2139
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:14,160
um so and by the way it was an old

2140
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:16,160
problem then too so

2141
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:17,520
this problem is and i kid you not almost

2142
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:19,200
50 years old

2143
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:20,720
alan smith did some work on this in the

2144
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:23,118
early to mid 70s

2145
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:24,879
okay the idea is file migration i've got

2146
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:27,119
this archive and i want to keep stuff

2147
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:28,960
some stuff in memory and memory or some

2148
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:32,079
stuff on disk and some stuff on tape

2149
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:34,720
how do i decide what to move around

2150
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:36,400
this works if you can predict accesses

2151
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:37,520
to the extent that you can say oh i

2152
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:39,920
think you know you access

2153
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:41,920
data piece a you know so for example we

2154
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:43,119
accessed your chest x-rays so we'll

2155
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:45,200
probably access your chest

2156
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:46,559
chest mri also and some of the older

2157
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:48,240
chest x-rays for you because we're

2158
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:50,720
thinking about was there a change

2159
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:52,160
that's easy you decide hey you know i

2160
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:52,799
think i'm going to go see that old photo

2161
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:54,640
today

2162
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:56,480
we had no clue you were going to do that

2163
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:57,598
how would we prevent it i don't know if

2164
01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:00,240
we could

2165
01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:01,760
so that's why it really depends on how

2166
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:03,759
effectively you can do this

2167
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:05,280
right there's no good answer to this i

2168
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:06,720
really wish there was

2169
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:08,240
but the thing is you can only make

2170
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:08,879
predictions if you have enough data

2171
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:10,319
points

2172
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:12,960
to actually be able to make them and for

2173
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:14,558
a lot of this migration stuff you don't

2174
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:16,480
this is an example of caching and it's

2175
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:18,799
been around for a long time

2176
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:21,040
but the thing but the the source of

2177
01:08:18,799 --> 01:08:23,359
things for caching is so large and the

2178
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:25,519
randomness and reuse is so small that it

2179
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:27,759
doesn't really help all that much

2180
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:29,359
unfortunately i wish it did about the

2181
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:31,040
best you can do is say well we're going

2182
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:32,799
to keep track of what things are related

2183
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:34,640
and likely to be accessed together

2184
01:08:32,799 --> 01:08:35,759
and pre-fetch those and i think that's

2185
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:37,279
probably what you that's probably the

2186
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:38,640
most effective thing to do is

2187
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:40,080
hey we wrote these together they're

2188
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:42,400
probably related let's bring them back

2189
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:42,399
together

2190
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:47,279
okay thank you um

2191
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:49,759
the next question comes from jeff

2192
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:52,000
canning what's your opinion on the

2193
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:55,040
trade-off between data formats and space

2194
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,640
for example xms xml is bulky but

2195
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:58,960
somewhat self-describing

2196
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:00,239
pnm is an easily readable image format

2197
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:02,640
but hugely space

2198
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:03,599
wasteful how do you think we should make

2199
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:05,199
the trade-off

2200
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:08,640
so that's a really good question my

2201
01:09:05,198 --> 01:09:11,678
suspicion on how to make the trade-off

2202
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:13,440
is that you would use a general purpose

2203
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:16,158
compression algorithm it won't save

2204
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:16,479
as much space as a specialized one but

2205
01:09:16,158 --> 01:09:18,479
for

2206
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:20,080
many formats that's a good way to go for

2207
01:09:18,479 --> 01:09:22,639
example if you take an image

2208
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:23,920
and gzip it or use some other kind of uh

2209
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:25,120
you know use another kind of of

2210
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:28,000
compression algorithm

2211
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:29,278
that's a standard you'll save 80 90 of

2212
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,238
the space that you would if

2213
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:34,480
you used gif you won't save as much as

2214
01:09:32,238 --> 01:09:36,238
jpeg because jpeg does lossy compression

2215
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:36,959
and jpeg knows what you can afford to

2216
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:39,278
lose

2217
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:40,719
mp4 mp3 are the same thing they know

2218
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:42,560
what you can afford to lose

2219
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:44,319
so that makes them more efficient but if

2220
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:46,640
you want lossless compression you pick

2221
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:47,759
one lossless compression algorithm and

2222
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:49,759
use it

2223
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:51,359
use it on everything so if you want xml

2224
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:54,800
great so in fact by the way

2225
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:55,600
for what it's worth um i'm pretty sure

2226
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:58,320
not 100

2227
01:09:55,600 --> 01:10:00,560
but about 90 sure that keynote and other

2228
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:02,559
programs that use xml for data storage

2229
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:04,400
actually do this they write their data

2230
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:05,679
out in xml but then they will often go

2231
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,799
and compress it using a standard

2232
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:08,800
compression algorithm

2233
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:10,719
to save the space and get the ability of

2234
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:12,880
hey it's easier to read the darn thing

2235
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:14,159
right but now that means one extra thing

2236
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,800
to keep track of what compression

2237
01:10:14,159 --> 01:10:17,440
algorithm

2238
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:19,199
am i using so it's not so bad but maybe

2239
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:20,879
maybe a little bit of an issue

2240
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:23,759
okay i think that's what you're going to

2241
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:23,760
end up having to use

2242
01:10:24,159 --> 01:10:31,839
thank you let's see if we have any other

2243
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:33,360
questions i i do have one maybe common

2244
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:35,280
slash question one of the things that

2245
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:39,360
intrigued me about dna storage

2246
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:42,400
is um in for archives

2247
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:43,280
making a copy with dna seems like very

2248
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:45,280
very low cost

2249
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:46,719
it's a medium that naturally is

2250
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:49,440
self-replicating with

2251
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:49,920
with errors of course which is a problem

2252
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:52,080
uh

2253
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:53,360
but there's nothing like it in any other

2254
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:56,800
media we always have to

2255
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:59,920
basically do malloc memcapi

2256
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:00,960
right there's nothing like it uh and dna

2257
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:03,600
there's something

2258
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:04,560
unique about that property or that media

2259
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:06,159
that

2260
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:08,400
i'm hoping somebody can can take

2261
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:09,519
advantage of well so that's absolutely

2262
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,040
right dna can make

2263
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:13,199
lots and lots of copies and they're very

2264
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:14,800
small now to be fair

2265
01:11:13,199 --> 01:11:16,239
it turns out that you can do the same

2266
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:18,880
thing that dna does

2267
01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:20,480
with optical disk for example okay you

2268
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:21,679
could have a system for optical disk

2269
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:22,718
that said okay i'm gonna have two

2270
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:24,320
optical in fact people

2271
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:26,239
not only can you have one you can go buy

2272
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:28,320
one today it's called an optical disc

2273
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:30,239
replicator you put a disc in one tray a

2274
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:31,840
a recorded disc in one tray you put in

2275
01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:34,320
a blank disk and another train and makes

2276
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:36,000
a copy which is exactly what dna does

2277
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,960
except in a much smaller and faster

2278
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,440
scale probably

2279
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:41,040
okay so that's something you could do

2280
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:42,000
but you know because remember dna when

2281
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:43,360
you make a copy

2282
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,719
you really are reading it and then

2283
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:46,159
writing except you're not reading it all

2284
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:47,360
the way to bits you're only reading it

2285
01:11:46,159 --> 01:11:49,360
all the way up to

2286
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:50,880
you know i see the base pairs there

2287
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:51,679
you'd want to make lots of copies and

2288
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:54,080
figure out

2289
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:54,960
what kinds of issues come in by the way

2290
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:56,080
as an interesting

2291
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:58,320
and you're absolutely right by the way

2292
01:11:56,080 --> 01:12:00,080
dna has that advantage one interesting

2293
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:03,040
thing about dna that i learned

2294
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:04,800
is that the one of the troubles with

2295
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:06,640
codex for dna

2296
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:08,560
is that with most kinds of archival

2297
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:09,040
media the only thing you're worried

2298
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:11,600
about

2299
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:13,199
are bit flips okay you're worried about

2300
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:14,080
a zero looking like a one or one looking

2301
01:12:13,199 --> 01:12:15,599
like a zero

2302
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:17,840
for dna you have to be worried about

2303
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:19,760
insertions and deletions as well

2304
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:22,159
that's weird it means the coding gets

2305
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:23,840
even harder for dna

2306
01:12:22,159 --> 01:12:25,839
i didn't realize that until i you know

2307
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:27,679
until the dna guys like yeah good point

2308
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:31,120
it does do insertions doesn't it

2309
01:12:27,679 --> 01:12:31,120
makes coding harder turns out

2310
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:37,679
thank you i think we're almost out of

2311
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:38,480
time maybe if you have a moment to look

2312
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:41,600
at

2313
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:42,400
a thread that keith smith started with

2314
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:44,159
again uh

2315
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:45,679
commenting on indexing and then a couple

2316
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:47,360
other people

2317
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:49,520
let me let me take a quick look at that

2318
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:51,759
just to make sure we've answered it

2319
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:52,640
yeah let's see so this the uh challenge

2320
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:55,760
okay

2321
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:57,199
okay yeah so i i think re

2322
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:59,120
i would agree okay so reading that

2323
01:12:57,199 --> 01:13:01,199
thread over i would agree with jeff

2324
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:02,880
i agree completely jeff is right your

2325
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:04,879
indexing will be necessary

2326
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:06,800
okay and ai would be helpful to do

2327
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:08,640
re-indexing and that's why

2328
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:10,239
you want to have individual devices have

2329
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:11,840
their own index because

2330
01:13:10,239 --> 01:13:13,360
re-indexing an entire you know

2331
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:14,800
re-indexing something

2332
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:16,559
is going to be difficult if you can do

2333
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:18,000
it a small device at a time hey

2334
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:19,840
so i'll give you a good example where

2335
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:22,239
this might be necessary all right

2336
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:23,199
suppose i tell my devices storing human

2337
01:13:22,239 --> 01:13:24,718
genomes

2338
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:26,480
to be on the lookout for genetic

2339
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:27,840
diseases okay

2340
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:30,639
i give it a list of all the genetic

2341
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:32,640
diseases all of the all the

2342
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:34,560
changes that might cause problems say be

2343
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:37,360
aware for these right

2344
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:38,080
time goes on we discovered 20 new ones

2345
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:39,280
uh well

2346
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:41,199
gee i guess i'm just gonna have to tell

2347
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:42,800
everybody to look for 20 more things

2348
01:13:41,199 --> 01:13:44,400
and that's exactly what you would do is

2349
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:45,760
ship out the changes to each one of the

2350
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:47,040
devices and say next time you do

2351
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:48,880
indexing

2352
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:50,640
look for these two because you might

2353
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:52,000
find something here right

2354
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:53,920
so that's i think what you're going to

2355
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,600
want to do right keith is right that he

2356
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:57,120
might index them based on who's in them

2357
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:58,000
and where right a future a future

2358
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:00,719
researcher

2359
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,239
right might want them index based on

2360
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:04,400
clothing well as long as you can give me

2361
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:05,519
a program that indexes clothing

2362
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:07,599
i can give it to every one of the

2363
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:09,199
devices that was the idea of we'll do

2364
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,600
background processing we'll look for

2365
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:11,678
stuff

2366
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:13,440
right and tony's right that indexing is

2367
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:15,600
a very hard problem is

2368
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:17,599
because what people want and how people

2369
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:19,360
look for it varies by person then

2370
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:21,040
you know i don't care about clothing but

2371
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:21,920
i could certainly see my wife caring

2372
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:23,280
about clothing

2373
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:24,800
i don't care about what people were

2374
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:25,280
eating but i can certainly see my my

2375
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,640
brother

2376
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:28,400
the food chemist who might care about

2377
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:30,000
what people are eating so

2378
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:31,440
you know that's the kind of thing where

2379
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,280
i can't look for what i don't know to

2380
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:35,040
look for and by doing indexing on

2381
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:36,080
individual devices we also have the

2382
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:37,440
advantage that

2383
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:38,800
i can say you know i'm just going to

2384
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:40,159
look at these few things i'm going to

2385
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:41,520
take a couple of

2386
01:14:40,159 --> 01:14:43,440
drives worth and do this kind of

2387
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:44,880
indexing another couple of drives we'll

2388
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:45,599
do another kind of indexing so one of

2389
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:47,120
them will do

2390
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:48,880
we'll do tony's search and one of them

2391
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:50,719
will do keith's search

2392
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:52,400
and and one you know and one of them

2393
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:53,840
will do gala's search and

2394
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:55,599
okay well that's great so i don't have

2395
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:57,920
to involve the whole archive

2396
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:59,520
saying index everything for this much

2397
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:01,840
easier to have a distributed index in

2398
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:05,440
that form

2399
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:08,960
okay we'll take one last question uh

2400
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:10,159
live and after that if it's okay to stay

2401
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:12,000
on slack or just

2402
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:13,759
being able to answer so this question

2403
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,000
i'm sorry it was earlier question i

2404
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:17,920
missed it it's from devestiwary

2405
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,840
can you please share more insights about

2406
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:20,880
the known failure modes reliability

2407
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:23,440
characteristics

2408
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:25,040
and blast radius of the glass media how

2409
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:25,839
would you compare that with the tape

2410
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:29,280
media

2411
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:30,719
okay so good question um blast radius of

2412
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:32,080
glass clearly

2413
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:34,480
there are a couple of failure modes one

2414
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:35,040
of them is failure in writing data which

2415
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:36,400
you can do

2416
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:38,239
which you can discover if you read it

2417
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,719
back if you know the pulse was too long

2418
01:15:38,239 --> 01:15:39,919
it made

2419
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:41,840
you know throw out a couple of bits

2420
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:43,920
nearby i'm pretty sure they're doing

2421
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:46,320
things that actually cover that problem

2422
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:47,520
obviously one failure mode of glass is

2423
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:49,360
oops

2424
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:51,199
you know drop the mic probably not the

2425
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:52,880
best idea to do with glass

2426
01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:55,440
but that does that is a failure mode and

2427
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:57,199
it will cause damage okay

2428
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:59,040
um the blast radius then is about a

2429
01:15:57,199 --> 01:16:02,000
terabyte

2430
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:03,519
and the blast radius really depends not

2431
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,280
just on the media itself

2432
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:07,120
but how you protect the media so for

2433
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:08,960
example if i have a raid group

2434
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:10,480
that has a width of a thousand and p and

2435
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:11,840
by the way this is not unreasonable

2436
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:14,799
remember uh hotmail had

2437
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:16,159
width of 254 i believe for raid you know

2438
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:19,199
251 plus three

2439
01:16:16,159 --> 01:16:20,000
if i lost four drives i lost data from

2440
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:23,120
250

2441
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:24,560
of them oops that sucks so how you do

2442
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:26,080
erasure coding has a lot to do with

2443
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:28,080
blast radius as well

2444
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:29,360
okay now as far as reliability

2445
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:31,920
characteristics glass

2446
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:33,679
actually lasts a really long time um

2447
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:35,440
several years ago hitachi had developed

2448
01:16:33,679 --> 01:16:37,120
a long-lived glass

2449
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:38,639
disk that they could store data on and i

2450
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:40,159
remember being interviewed by one of the

2451
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:41,840
science publications you know popular

2452
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:42,960
science publications

2453
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:44,320
asking me what i thought about this

2454
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:45,920
because they made the claim probably

2455
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,639
correct that they could that the glass

2456
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:49,360
would survive

2457
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:50,800
for 20 million years my comment was that

2458
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:52,639
i have a term for 20 million year old

2459
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:54,560
glass it's called sand

2460
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:56,159
right great that it survives for 20

2461
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:57,520
million years but we're going to put it

2462
01:16:56,159 --> 01:16:58,480
for 20 million years hell

2463
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:00,719
we don't know where to put it for a

2464
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:02,959
thousand years right remember

2465
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:03,920
time is really long if i say i want to

2466
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:06,480
keep something for 100

2467
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:07,840
000 years that's from apes walking on

2468
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:10,959
the plains of africa

2469
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:12,640
to now that's hard right i don't think

2470
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:15,440
you can do that

2471
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:16,000
so that's where the blast radius is what

2472
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:19,120
you can do

2473
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:21,280
is try to tailor the erasure codes to

2474
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:22,480
the characteristics of the device blast

2475
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:23,840
radius for glass

2476
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:25,759
in that you know the sort of minimal

2477
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:26,560
blast radius is pretty big you lost the

2478
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:28,480
glass

2479
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:30,480
you know it got damaged but you can use

2480
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:32,320
ecc to get around that for dna it might

2481
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:34,000
be a much smaller blast radius but much

2482
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:35,599
more likely to happen

2483
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,199
failure mode for glass from what i

2484
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:37,840
understand and again i can give you the

2485
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:40,879
pointers to

2486
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:42,159
the papers on this it's much less likely

2487
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:44,239
to happen than it is for a lot of other

2488
01:17:42,159 --> 01:17:46,000
media because glass is a really stable

2489
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:48,480
thing no glass doesn't flow that's an

2490
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,480
urban myth

2491
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:54,000
okay thank you very much and we took uh

2492
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:57,440
more of your time than we budgeted

2493
01:17:54,000 --> 01:18:00,480
uh and thank you for managing this

2494
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:03,519
new format so

2495
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:05,759
uh for everyone uh let's thank ethan

2496
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:07,199
thank you uh i will bet you guys i will

2497
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:09,040
make the slides available uh

2498
01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:11,440
should i just send them to you eras or

2499
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:13,040
uh yeah we'll we'll post them somehow

2500
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:14,639
we'll we'll figure out how to do that

2501
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:17,360
okay uh slack remains

2502
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:18,480
open um so anybody who wants to ask

2503
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:20,880
questions of ethan

2504
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:22,320
or any other of the speakers um it will

2505
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:24,800
remain open

2506
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:27,920
and otherwise thank you for the first

2507
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:31,679
day and we'll see you here tomorrow
