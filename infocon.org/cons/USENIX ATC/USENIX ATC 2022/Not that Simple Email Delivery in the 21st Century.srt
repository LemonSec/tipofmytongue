1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,359
ER and I'm presenting not that simple

3
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,359
email delivery in the 21st century in

4
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,000
the next 20 minutes I will present you

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,939
how we measured ameliorated standards

6
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:30,240
so why do we bother looking at email

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,880
delivery if sending an email looks that

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,559
simple

9
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,059
because

10
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:38,880
the number of email rated RCS has

11
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,340
increased dramatically over the past 30

12
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,660
years and the number has went up from

13
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,640
below 100 to nearly

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,120
um for 400 to 500 but not all of the

15
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,340
standard not all of these rfcs represent

16
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,320
standards

17
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,940
only the bottom three status on the left

18
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,500
belong to the standards track

19
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,339
and we have about 225 proposed standards

20
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:09,119
and some of them actually influence

21
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,140
email delivery so we have extended smdp

22
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,720
with various standards to provide

23
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,240
protection and transit to add

24
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,140
authenticity to email delivery and some

25
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,119
of this impacts

26
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:25,860
um delivery

27
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,360
so

28
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,060
the problem is that we have this huge

29
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,400
number of standards and it's hard to

30
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,579
keep track for operators what standards

31
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:38,400
to implement in which configurations

32
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,360
so we do measurements to gain an

33
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,159
overview of how our standards are

34
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,420
implemented

35
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,840
and to help operators decide on which

36
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,079
standards to implement

37
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,759
this brings me to the outline of this

38
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,979
talk I will first

39
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:59,520
talk about the scope and then we will do

40
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,320
a short background on email delivery

41
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,020
then we talk about the measurement setup

42
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,600
and I present our data sets and our

43
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,419
findings at the end

44
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:12,180
so there are two perspectives in email

45
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,140
Theory

46
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,080
and the first is the sender side and the

47
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,819
second is the receiver side on the

48
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:20,580
sender side we have for successful mail

49
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,520
delivery we we have two questions is the

50
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,860
sender able to reach the receiver

51
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,560
and the second question is how do these

52
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,300
additional standards that provide

53
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,660
authenticity impact email delivery and

54
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,599
on the receiver side because there is a

55
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:39,300
huge number of analysis bulk mail we

56
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,280
cannot accept every incoming email

57
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,340
so we have to somehow weed out some

58
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,000
males and the the question receiver side

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,040
is should the receiver accept incoming

60
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,860
email and this topic is broadly covered

61
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,660
by related measurements and if you're

62
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,220
interested in that you can look at our

63
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,340
paper we have a pretty big section about

64
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,560
this where we summarize related work and

65
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,420
also present our findings in our data

66
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,040
sets

67
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,739
so let's focus on email delivery from

68
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:08,819
the sender side

69
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:13,260
first a mail user agent connects to the

70
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,280
outgoing mail server for mail delivery

71
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,980
and after successful mail submission the

72
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,200
mail transfer agent has to find out

73
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,180
where to send this email to

74
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,360
so we will ask his resolver to resolve

75
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,519
the exchange record of the receiver

76
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,680
domain

77
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,319
and the resolver if it doesn't have the

78
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,239
answer in the cache we'll perform a

79
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,700
recursive DNS lookup and the request

80
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,280
will finally land at the turretive DNS

81
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,819
server of the recipient's domain

82
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:47,580
and the authoritative DNS server will

83
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,280
return the answer and then we can also

84
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,840
look up the IP address of the target

85
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,560
server and initiate the smdp connection

86
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,780
which you saw on the first slide

87
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,400
so this brings us to a mail delivery but

88
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,500
currently this mail delivery is in plain

89
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,099
text so in regard of confidentiality

90
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,220
Integrity authenticity

91
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:14,879
and also from the DNS lookup side we

92
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,380
don't have integrity entertain

93
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,620
so in the real world actually a huge

94
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,060
number of

95
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,360
um email in transit are encrypted but

96
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,340
the mail server the sending mail server

97
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,960
does not know it before and if

98
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,240
encryption is available so he will

99
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,479
connect to the receivers mail transfer

100
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,300
agent and the mail receiver's mail

101
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,919
transfer agent

102
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:44,580
will then be able to offer the star TLS

103
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,460
option so to encrypt traffic

104
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:52,020
and then the the sender male transfer

105
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,419
agent can take the opportunity and

106
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,759
encrypt this traffic so we first start

107
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,800
in clear text and then we change to

108
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,780
encrypted traffic

109
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:04,320
but as opportunistic encryption is we

110
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,300
um it is defined to accept every

111
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,780
receiver certificate doesn't matter

112
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,919
um

113
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:13,740
if it's expired or if it's self-signed

114
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,259
so we do not verify the validity of the

115
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:18,800
certificate

116
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,120
so it prevents passive eavesdropping so

117
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,539
fire tapping but if an active attacker

118
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:30,180
presents a wrong certificate so we are

119
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,160
still vulnerable to monkey in the middle

120
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,860
attacks downgrade attacks if this

121
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,680
started less option is stripped from the

122
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,860
traffic

123
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,000
and so why don't we use this um second

124
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,120
Channel via DNS to enhance this um

125
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:55,020
so to enhance this mail delivery and we

126
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,419
protect this second Channel we can

127
00:05:57,419 --> 00:05:59,820
protect the second Channel via DNS SEC

128
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,240
so to actually verify the integrity and

129
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,199
artistically of the DNS responses so

130
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,560
this works by cryptocore fairly

131
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,940
cryptographically I'm signing the DNS

132
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,440
records

133
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,880
and then we can verify if the answer is

134
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,820
correct or was maybe spoofed

135
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,080
so

136
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,660
if we secure the second Channel we can

137
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,419
also

138
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:30,000
put information there that encryption is

139
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,639
available beforehand so the MX record

140
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,280
alone doesn't hint if encryption is

141
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,759
available but we can put a tlsa record

142
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:41,460
there that provides certificate

143
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,460
information and the sending mail server

144
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,800
knows beforehand that the receiver will

145
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,740
provide or will

146
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,740
have encryption available

147
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,620
and this is a far better setup because

148
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,400
now we can check the certificate of the

149
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:04,440
receiver server and check its validity

150
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,039
so from the security perspective we now

151
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,340
check all these boxes confidentiality

152
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,620
interacting the authenticity

153
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,100
and for domains that have not that are

154
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,560
not able to sign their records via it in

155
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,380
essec we can also there was also a

156
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,599
second standard

157
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,280
developed mail transfer agent strict

158
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,860
transfer policy and

159
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,259
this is for domains that cannot sign

160
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:34,979
their records by adding essec

161
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:37,139
but it works as the same principle we

162
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:38,699
have the second Channel and we hint that

163
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:40,500
encryption is available

164
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,500
so for our measurement we focused on

165
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,960
email delivery after successful email

166
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,400
submission

167
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,340
and so when the email sender provider

168
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,020
tries to deliver its email to the

169
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,720
receiver's provider

170
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,660
and yes as in the I said in the

171
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,360
interaction we had different setups that

172
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,580
allowed us

173
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:06,120
to check whether an insander supports

174
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,400
certain standards or supports

175
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,220
encrypted milk delivery

176
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,380
and we can check was the email delivered

177
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:20,360
or not so this setup allows us

178
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,400
to measure email standards but it also

179
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,840
allows users to check their email

180
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,240
providers that's my provider support a

181
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,979
certain standard and it's also for

182
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:32,760
operators to see if their setup works as

183
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,979
expected so they can verify their email

184
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:38,580
delivery with our measurement addresses

185
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,880
so what did we configure

186
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,679
we looked at the ongoing transition to

187
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,279
the IPv6 internet and we both measured

188
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,880
the mail service and the DNS resolution

189
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,779
and our setup looks as follows we had

190
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:57,959
this different IP level IP levels

191
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:00,420
configured here you can so see all the

192
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,140
combinations and then we can verify if

193
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,080
there's an S resolution is possible via

194
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,920
IPv6 and if mail transport is possible

195
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,200
via P6

196
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,100
so our second goal was to measure

197
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,180
opportunistic versus strict TLS

198
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,120
configurations so we looked how many

199
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,700
providers are still

200
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,640
transporting mail in clear text how many

201
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,279
um react to TLS enforcement on the

202
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,779
receiver side so how many actually

203
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,420
support

204
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:36,779
providing this star TLS encryption we

205
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:38,640
also look if providers would validate

206
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,940
certificates and we looked at this

207
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,000
downgrade many the middle protection

208
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,680
with Dane

209
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,500
so how can you measure that our

210
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,980
measurement targets once provided no

211
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,440
encryption at all and then we can look

212
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,660
how many will deliver mail to a Target

213
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,000
without encryption available

214
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,200
and on the second target we enforced TLS

215
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,380
to see if how many providers would be

216
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,500
able to deliver mail encrypted we had an

217
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,420
invalid certificate on the mail server

218
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,420
to check if anyone would validate it and

219
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:19,860
we also our last setup was that we

220
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,860
provided a certificate in DNS but it

221
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,740
didn't match the certificate that was on

222
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,260
the mail server

223
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,660
and furthermore we looked at DNS

224
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,480
Equalization so how many resolvers would

225
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,899
actually validate the DNS responses and

226
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:38,940
we provided an invalid chain of trust

227
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,040
and based off really based on related

228
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,640
work about 30 percent of DNS SEC zones

229
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,279
science zones do not provide this chain

230
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,140
of trust so this is the number one error

231
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:52,640
when configuring DNS seg

232
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,339
and the last case was that we wanted to

233
00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:00,600
check if um senders are RFC conform so

234
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,300
if they actually tried to redeliver mail

235
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,779
in case of a temporary error so spammers

236
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:09,839
usually do not keep the state and if and

237
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,360
temporary error occurs they do not try

238
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,440
to redeliver emails a second time

239
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,540
and based on the setups we collected

240
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:22,040
different data sets we wanted to look at

241
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,480
regular providers in the email ecosystem

242
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,120
we looked at uh

243
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,120
set of large providers and then finally

244
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,519
we also looked at how spammers would

245
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:35,760
react to this certain setups

246
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,019
and for regular providers we had to

247
00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:42,540
ask people around the globe to send mail

248
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,720
to our Target setups so it required

249
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,079
active user action and we promoted this

250
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:51,720
campaign for over a year via several

251
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,120
channels and Via mailing lists around

252
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:59,160
the globe we had around we had 622

253
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,899
participants from belonging to

254
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:07,440
436 providers below from 53 countries

255
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,180
around the world and with that number

256
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,920
6842

257
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,399
males were attempted to deliver and the

258
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:19,560
actual number of meals we receive for

259
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,019
4660.

260
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:23,880
and a requirement

261
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,240
was that at least one male of the 11

262
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,480
different measurement setups would reach

263
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,620
our system so we can verify to if the

264
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,480
the males were sent to all the other

265
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,519
measurement addresses

266
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:42,680
so if mail delivery was attempted

267
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,820
and for large providers we registered

268
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,139
Accounts at the most large providers

269
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:56,160
used or we collected the large provider

270
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,680
list by looking at passive DNS

271
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,579
so we looked at how many email domains

272
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:05,459
Point their Mail Exchange records at a

273
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:07,800
certain domain and we had the Fireside

274
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:12,300
DNS database available with a one month

275
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:12,899
um

276
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:17,399
of a mix lookups this resulted in seven

277
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:20,940
T three million DNS lookups and at the

278
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,980
right you can see we list the top five

279
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,399
providers they are accountable for 27

280
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,800
percent of uh

281
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,420
mail around the globe and then this is

282
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,180
followed by a heavy tale of smaller

283
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,680
providers

284
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,540
so we compared our list with related

285
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,360
work and we can see that related work

286
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,220
has usually different perceptions of

287
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,720
large providers

288
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,600
so the overlap between manual rankings

289
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,180
is really low around the globe the only

290
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,160
provider found in all large providers

291
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,959
data set is Google

292
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,480
so no others no other large providers

293
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,120
did match in this in this data set

294
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,579
and I think for for emulated

295
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:03,839
measurements it's really important that

296
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,060
we find a common perception of large

297
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:09,839
providers so our method and the method

298
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,139
from you Leo and I who used an active

299
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:15,480
measurement so he collected meal

300
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,459
exchange records and certificate

301
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:20,579
information and we used passive DNS are

302
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:22,139
the latest two

303
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:22,860
um

304
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,079
methods to rank large providers and we

305
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:27,779
have also the most large providers in

306
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:28,860
common

307
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,740
so the last data set we registered 5 a

308
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,860
50 spam domains and we looked at

309
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,860
different categories which are more

310
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,019
likely to receive spam and we found out

311
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:43,800
that mostly older domains receive more

312
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,399
spam and I will fasten this a little up

313
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:49,440
to come to the conclu to the findings of

314
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,980
our work so

315
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,740
um we pointed this 50 expired domains to

316
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,720
our measurement setups we had a baseline

317
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,079
plane for plane ipv4 delivery and then

318
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:03,839
after the the Baseline we pointed them

319
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,060
to our different measurement targets to

320
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:10,019
see if spam volume decreases or

321
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:11,579
um not

322
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:16,199
and the spam and we received about 6 700

323
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:19,800
emails came from

324
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,820
mostly from China so 28 came from China

325
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:30,240
and from USA came around 21 of emails

326
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,519
and the rest of the countries are around

327
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:35,220
five percent or less

328
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,880
so if you look at the findings

329
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,800
if you look at how many senders can

330
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,019
actually deliver mail to IPv6 only

331
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:47,220
Target and look at our first setup we

332
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,339
see that DNS IPv6 resolution is

333
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:53,399
supported by two-thirds of providers

334
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:57,420
but mail delivery is only supported by

335
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,779
20 less

336
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:03,500
so

337
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:06,660
um mail is a little behind DNS in IPv6

338
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,579
support

339
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:12,079
and for TLS configuration

340
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,120
we have these setups we look at plain

341
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,339
text delivery so

342
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:18,060
um

343
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,459
nearly every provider will still deliver

344
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:23,459
emails in plain text and only one

345
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:25,920
percent so this relates to five

346
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,040
providers in our data set did not

347
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,139
refrain from sending emails in plain

348
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:32,519
text

349
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:34,680
when we enforced start your lesson the

350
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,440
receiver side we found 10 percent of

351
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,779
regular providers were still not able to

352
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:42,980
encrypt messages

353
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,839
in transit but all large providers were

354
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,120
capable of doing so

355
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,920
when we provide an invalid certificate

356
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,040
only one regular provided validated

357
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,079
certificate and or large providers

358
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:56,880
accepted the certificate

359
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,380
and

360
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,720
the first

361
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,600
setup very enforced TLS

362
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,760
um led to

363
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,760
22 percent of regular providers

364
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,520
that validated this certificate mismatch

365
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,579
and 23 of large providers validated the

366
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:16,020
certificate mismatch

367
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,939
so

368
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:21,000
um TLS enforcement is actually getting

369
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,339
validated more and more

370
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:26,099
because related work found far less

371
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:28,620
validation rates

372
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:32,040
and coming to dynastic validation which

373
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,620
is the foundation for providing

374
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,600
certificates over DNS

375
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,059
and here we can see a large discrepancy

376
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,620
between regular providers and large

377
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:44,820
providers far more regular providers did

378
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,860
validate our dynastic responses than

379
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,419
large providers did

380
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:50,700
so they do this because there are still

381
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,280
a lot of genetic misconfigurations and

382
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,340
they would actually lose a large range

383
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,500
of receivers where they cannot deliver

384
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,860
mails to even the NASA error occurs

385
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:05,400
and finally we look at spam volume we

386
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,460
had this gray listing applied that led

387
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:12,960
to 37 percent less spam and then we have

388
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,100
our IPv6 only DNS resolution Target

389
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,400
um did this decreased spam volume by

390
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,539
around half so a lot of spam senders

391
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:26,400
rely on public resolvers that are

392
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,539
actually capable of Performing DNS pv6

393
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:32,220
resolution

394
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,380
and

395
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,840
when we enforced you less understand on

396
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,500
the receiver side we see that um

397
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,080
male spam volume decreased by 66 percent

398
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,080
so a lot of spammers are not capable of

399
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,720
Performing T lesson checks or refrain

400
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,000
from doing so because it's a overhead

401
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,900
for them

402
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,240
and they don't need it to actually send

403
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,260
emails and we also see that there is far

404
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:02,820
less band volume on IPv6 if we have IPv6

405
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,780
only

406
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,840
um

407
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,419
an IPv6 only male receiver

408
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:12,500
so this brings me to the conclusion that

409
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:16,500
for male transfer agents and resolvers

410
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,740
male transfer agents are behind in IPv6

411
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,500
support because far more resolvers

412
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,280
support

413
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:23,820
um

414
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,120
IPv6 DNS resolution then mail transfer

415
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,240
agent support ibv6 delivery we have an

416
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,780
increasing support for enforcing TLs but

417
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:37,399
still every large provider

418
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,200
delivers mailing plain text if we do not

419
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,500
provide these tlse records in DNS and

420
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,360
after our measurement period also large

421
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,400
providers really large providers like

422
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,400
Microsoft announced tlsa support so it's

423
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,520
really good to announce this records

424
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,860
via DNS

425
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:59,039
and we also see the the discrepancy in

426
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,260
DNS circulation between large and

427
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,820
smaller providers

428
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,120
so large providers have a different

429
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,860
standpoint in standard adoption than

430
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,440
smaller providers too so a lot of

431
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,100
measurements forget to measure this this

432
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,780
regular providers so we only look at the

433
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,380
large providers but a lot of regular

434
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,900
operators have higher DNS accreditation

435
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,840
rates than these large providers do

436
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,980
and the dustpoint is also that um

437
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:32,640
we want to keep reachability at our

438
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,419
first Target but security comes second

439
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:39,059
so this is what makes

440
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:42,918
um military not that simple

441
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,140
so

442
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:46,860
um

443
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,539
we published our measurement

444
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,419
infrastructure via GitHub if you want to

445
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:55,380
look at rfcs and RFC is belonging to a

446
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,620
certain topic we probably we plan to

447
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,320
publish this RFC Search tool and we also

448
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,020
plan to make an web app for our email

449
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,080
delivery measurement addresses so simple

450
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,720
users can also check their email

451
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,740
providers and at the right uh post the

452
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,660
require code to my Twitter where I will

453
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:19,380
announce these plans in the future

454
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,960
so thank you and I'm ready to take any

455
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,200
questions
