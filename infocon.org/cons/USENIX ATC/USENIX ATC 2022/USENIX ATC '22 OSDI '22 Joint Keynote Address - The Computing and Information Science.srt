1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,859
good morning everyone it's wonderful to

3
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:18,720
be back to in-person conferences I

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,400
forgot about the Blazing lights and

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,439
everything associated with this world

6
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,960
but it's great to be here

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,980
um as as Noah mentioned I wear two hats

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,679
these days I'm a long time faculty

9
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,380
member in Princeton in the computer

10
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,660
science department where I've worked on

11
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,460
different architecture topics with a

12
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,100
little bit of systems thrown in over the

13
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,040
years if you are an academic computer

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,840
science researcher in the US you

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,420
probably have gotten funding from NSF

16
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,039
you almost certainly have gotten funding

17
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,300
from NSF and so as is not uncommon at

18
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,699
NSF people do what are called rotations

19
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:59,879
in to serve on the other side to go into

20
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:02,059
NSF and to serve the research Community

21
00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:04,860
by stewarding the research process at

22
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,680
this government agency and so I started

23
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,200
that rotation it's a four-year term to

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,960
go to NSF I started in February 2020

25
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,820
uh that's a very interesting time to

26
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,680
start a new job I had five weeks in

27
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,340
person before everything went uh down

28
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,259
the path that you know about

29
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:25,439
um and so I'm speaking today with my NSF

30
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,640
hat on

31
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,100
but I'm also speaking with the

32
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,140
experiences of someone who's been able

33
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,420
to work on as Noah mentioned power

34
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,820
efficient Computing and zebra tracking

35
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,040
and Quantum Computing and I think if you

36
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,799
have any questions as young students out

37
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:41,939
there if you have any questions about

38
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,280
why do an academic career I would say

39
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,740
that there's no company that would have

40
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,479
funded me to do all three of those

41
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,659
things to the degree of mixing that I

42
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,399
was able to do and so I'm grateful to

43
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,040
NSF for the funding that let that mixing

44
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,380
happen so NSF is a U.S government agency

45
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,360
it was founded in the aftermath of World

46
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,979
War II

47
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:09,060
um America was not a tech Powerhouse a

48
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,120
hundred years ago but in the early part

49
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,060
of the 20th century

50
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,800
America did sort of grow in its Science

51
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,200
and Technology capabilities and the idea

52
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,300
of the NSF was to sort of come out of

53
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,520
World War II and say how can we use

54
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,520
these capabilities for the best good and

55
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,280
so the mission statement of NSF is what

56
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,020
you see here to promote the progress of

57
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,120
science first and foremost and then to

58
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,599
advance on different societal benefits

59
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,459
and this is our building in Alexandria

60
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:41,280
Virginia which we're back to we were

61
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,519
fully virtual for over a year uh we're

62
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:46,620
back in person to some degree and more

63
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,260
in person if you do review panels for us

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,420
thank you and most of those are staying

65
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,340
virtual for a little while longer so

66
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,040
this is NSF as a whole when I think

67
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,620
about what these mission statements mean

68
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,819
to me

69
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:02,700
uh I often think about it using this

70
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,060
analogy so here's a tree this tree is in

71
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,819
my backyard in my home in New Jersey my

72
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:10,680
husband and I love this tree we have no

73
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,080
idea who planted it and actually a lot

74
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,879
of different cultures have this notion

75
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,819
of one generation planting the tree so

76
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:19,560
that subsequent Generations can benefit

77
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,680
from it from the shade from the Beauty

78
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,780
from the oxygen and so forth and

79
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,940
research is like that too right when you

80
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,980
have an idea of a project and you start

81
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,019
it or when you sit down and first have

82
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:33,300
that first discussion with a student or

83
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,340
a collaborator about some work you want

84
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,440
to start or when you write a proposal

85
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,319
and send it to a funding agency or come

86
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,879
up with a pitch and Pitch someone for

87
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,680
funding those are all examples of

88
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,220
planting trees and so when NSF and other

89
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,019
funding agencies think about what to

90
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:51,000
fund really what we're doing is we're

91
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,739
thinking about where would it best

92
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:54,900
benefit Society for us to have more

93
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,319
trees planted and how can we sort of

94
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,720
cultivate the right mix of trees uh

95
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,940
maybe planting some from acorns and some

96
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,379
that are a little more mature from the

97
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:06,360
start and so forth to create the best

98
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,819
benefits and so I usually start with

99
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:10,200
this and then I talk about different

100
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,780
what I've come to call tree stories of

101
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,620
NSF impacts through this process

102
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,019
um and my true story today is actually

103
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:22,440
three in one so on the left there are

104
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,440
foundational impacts that NSF and the

105
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,940
directorate that I lead the computer and

106
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,320
information science and engineering

107
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,080
directorate have brought to the world so

108
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,620
that picture on the far left is uh was

109
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,419
in the news about a month ago right that

110
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:39,660
is the recently imaged black hole of

111
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,940
sage star

112
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,340
within our own Milky Way galaxy and some

113
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,479
folks might look at that and see

114
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:46,979
astronomy

115
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:48,960
uh but come on this is a Computing

116
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,180
audience and so you guys I hope look at

117
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,479
this and see Computing uh because tens

118
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,660
of millions of CPU hours led to this

119
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,759
picture being at the resolution it is

120
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,120
but even more so uh incredible

121
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,100
computational photography algorithms

122
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,560
Bayesian inferencing algorithms led to

123
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,360
the resolution in this picture and if

124
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,120
you go back and watch the press

125
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,220
conference from when this was announced

126
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,040
about six weeks ago now you'll see that

127
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,900
the third of the four speakers that were

128
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,020
on the panel for that press conference

129
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,780
was an early career pre-tenure Caltech

130
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,360
professor and size gave her her career

131
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,720
award uh last year Katie Bauman for her

132
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,060
work on computational Imaging so we're

133
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,220
proud of the way that we have founded is

134
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,440
that we have funded fundamental work in

135
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,180
how information is gathered analyzed and

136
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,919
communicated we're proud of the fact

137
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:42,780
that sixty percent of the Turing Award

138
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,520
winners in the history of the touring

139
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,220
Award winner have received NSF funding

140
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,300
second one is about translational

141
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,340
impacts and I don't expect you to be

142
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,800
able to read that middle diagram but if

143
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,060
you're curious about that middle diagram

144
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,919
the URL for it is in the lower right

145
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:01,080
corner of the screen it's from a

146
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,960
National Academy study so over the past

147
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,699
20 years the National Academy has

148
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,919
periodically done something that's come

149
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,860
to be called the tire tracks diagram

150
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:14,280
that maps from different foundational CS

151
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,860
topic areas like systems like

152
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,860
architecture like Ai and so forth Maps

153
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,080
the timelines of different seminal

154
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,259
results and their impacts on the world

155
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,780
and so the left hand side of this

156
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,520
diagram are the different topic areas

157
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,100
that I mentioned and those things that

158
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,440
have come to be called tire tracks are

159
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,800
horizontal timelines of from the 60s to

160
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,840
the present what are seminal results and

161
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,280
how do they interconnect you can see

162
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,199
swooping arrows that go back and forth

163
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,479
showing how one field picked up on work

164
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:47,759
that another one did

165
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,080
um when you get to the middle of the

166
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,580
diagram you're talking about how those

167
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,400
impacts were then taken up by the

168
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,080
companies many of whom are in the room

169
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,600
that actually take from the research

170
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,280
space and and put it out into the

171
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,660
product space so those are the apples

172
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,580
the qualcomms and so forth

173
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,560
uh the interesting thing about this

174
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,120
newest version of the tire tracks

175
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,759
diagram and it's called the tire tracks

176
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,740
diagram because of those

177
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,660
things on the left hand side that do

178
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,060
look like skid marks right the

179
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,380
interesting thing about this newest

180
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,120
version it gets updated every four years

181
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,720
this is the 2020 update is the right

182
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,160
hand side of this which looks more

183
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,199
subway map than tire tracks at this

184
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,539
point that subway map is showing how

185
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:29,220
different ideas from many different

186
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,979
parts of our community

187
00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:34,580
intertwine and then go out and shape

188
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,440
economic and societal sectors very far

189
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,819
from what we traditionally call

190
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:41,580
information technology so this is when

191
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,819
folks from Deer the tractor folks come

192
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:48,000
and say actually data and information is

193
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,580
dramatically reshaping agriculture or

194
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,520
folks from Health companies or

195
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,080
Automotive companies or entertainment

196
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,680
companies Disney NFL come and say to the

197
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,199
National academies I.T research has

198
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,479
dramatically transformed us as well so

199
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:04,860
by the time you get to the right hand

200
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,240
side of this diagram you're talking

201
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,720
about whoops a trillion dollars of

202
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,400
impact

203
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,099
uh on the world because I'm a power

204
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:15,780
efficient Computing expert I can put my

205
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,539
batteries back in place while talking

206
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,879
um okay on the right hand side are the

207
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,699
societal impacts

208
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:27,419
NSF funds a range of work that uh

209
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:30,300
dramatically changes communities in

210
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,219
America and in the world we do smart

211
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:33,659
connected communities we do different

212
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,219
things around sort of climate resilient

213
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:37,080
communities and we're also changing the

214
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,479
face of computing by funding a range of

215
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:42,000
education and Workforce Investments that

216
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,559
are designed to change how people enter

217
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:46,200
into the Computing curriculums and in

218
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,080
different schools and how they are

219
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,660
retained through CS Workforce all the

220
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,160
way through their lives

221
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,100
so that is us

222
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,040
great so this is another view of us this

223
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,440
is within the organization that I lead

224
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,420
what does the org chart look like and I

225
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,640
know org charts are boring but I want to

226
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,839
show this for a few different reasons

227
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,540
first of all the green and the two Blues

228
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,279
those are the different sort of research

229
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,120
division areas mapped out across across

230
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,160
our whole field and you can see

231
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,380
hopefully yourself in some of the topic

232
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,820
areas that are there

233
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,399
uh the upper left the office of advanced

234
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,080
cyber infrastructure is organizationally

235
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,360
within size but has this broader mission

236
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,420
to serve the full scientific Community

237
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:32,279
with cyber infrastructure resources so

238
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:34,440
that's yes computer scientists but it's

239
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,480
also the astronomers that we talked

240
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,920
about on the previous slide and so on

241
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,440
and so forth I also showed this slide

242
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,019
because you know NSF is really trying to

243
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:45,060
be a very approachable organization if

244
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,320
you have questions if you have ideas

245
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,360
about trees you want to plant you can

246
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,740
reach out to these folks you can reach

247
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,260
out to the program officers who work in

248
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,839
our organization hundreds of them and

249
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:57,839
hopefully get some guidance

250
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,480
uh but we're happy to draw and color

251
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,360
across the lines when it makes sense and

252
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,820
so we have a range of director-wide

253
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,459
initiatives and we have a range of

254
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:11,519
initiatives where we lead and all of NSF

255
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,800
is with us on the parade so things like

256
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,420
secure and Trust through the cyberspace

257
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,180
that many of you may contribute to

258
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:20,000
that's an example of an nsf-wide program

259
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,519
that uh that we lead the nationally AI

260
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,080
research institutes I'll talk about more

261
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,880
later as well

262
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,820
by the Numbers this slide pretty much

263
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,459
says it all as was mentioned our budget

264
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:34,380
is just over a billion dollars these

265
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,480
numbers are for fiscal year 21 which is

266
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,160
the last complete fiscal year that we

267
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,040
have FY 22 will end in the end of

268
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,620
September so just over a billion dollars

269
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,920
in budget and around 7 000 proposals

270
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,860
come in the door and thanks to many of

271
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,779
you we review them with a peer review

272
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:54,600
process and we are able to make Awards

273
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,459
to about a quarter of them we'd love for

274
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:59,940
that to be higher we uh we in many years

275
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,860
have declined over a billion dollars of

276
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,019
highly rated Awards

277
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:06,779
um and that's just a an opportunity cost

278
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:09,779
that uh should keep a lot of us up at

279
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:10,760
night

280
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,440
in terms of the numbers of what gets

281
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,959
funded I think one of the numbers that

282
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:17,700
surprises a lot of people is our funding

283
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,720
in size goes out to 373 institutions so

284
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,040
in America we have this notion of

285
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,079
Carnegie R1 or the most research

286
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:27,959
intensive universities there are about

287
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:31,980
150 R1 universities in America and size

288
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,140
essentially funds all of those

289
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,620
and then 220 more schools so that's

290
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,899
undergrad institutions that's community

291
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,360
colleges that's a whole range of an

292
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,519
ecosystem out there that goes Way Beyond

293
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:48,300
the r1s and through that ecosystem we

294
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,160
fund about 20 000 people

295
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,220
from professors to grad students to

296
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,519
undergrads we Fund in all 50 states and

297
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:59,579
three territories and we fund us over 70

298
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:02,579
minority serving institutions uh upshot

299
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:05,579
of all of this is that NSF as a whole

300
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:07,620
and the size directorate in particular

301
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,200
fund around 80 percent of the federally

302
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,720
funded CS that happens in the U.S at

303
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,760
academic institutions so I sometimes

304
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,440
like to joke that if you're out in the

305
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,940
audience and you're at an American

306
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,399
University there's a good chance I pay

307
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,860
your salary at least a teeny bit of it

308
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,839
uh so thank you for all you're doing in

309
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:27,600
terms of the technical ideas that we try

310
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,959
to shape within size we think about them

311
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,820
in terms of three organizational

312
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,680
umbrellas and these aren't intended to

313
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,839
be narrow Pathways for the community to

314
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,700
kind of stay on like a balance beam

315
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,019
these are intended to be broad

316
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:41,820
organizational umbrellas that reflect

317
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,279
the inflection points we're seeing as a

318
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:46,079
field and as a society

319
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,820
and I'll talk about each of these a

320
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,740
little more in the slides that follow

321
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,079
but the first one is sort of navigating

322
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,720
this seismic shift and yes if you work

323
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,040
at a place called size there's a little

324
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,560
pun there navigating the seismic shift

325
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,180
that we're all seeing at the end of

326
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,420
Moore's Law the second one is about the

327
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,800
the inflection points that we're seeing

328
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,500
as as AI sort of matures out of many

329
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,839
different size topic areas and impact

330
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,240
society and the third one is about the

331
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,700
call for us to consider and design

332
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,579
beneficial socio-technical systems

333
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:18,899
so

334
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:22,079
on the first of these uh in an up shot

335
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,060
you know the end of Moore's Law and

336
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,500
Denard scaling

337
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,600
uh or at least the slowing of Moore's

338
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,200
Law uh impacts all aspects of computing

339
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,720
and I think I I've been around long

340
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,760
enough to remember when we shifted say

341
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,000
from bipolar transistors to CMOS

342
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,800
transistors and probably many folks who

343
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,360
were up higher in the software stack

344
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,160
were completely unaware that that shift

345
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,660
was going on because there were

346
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,579
abstraction layers that meant you didn't

347
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,880
need to know or care but we've lost the

348
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,800
ability to rely on abstraction layers

349
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,920
this time these shifts are affecting the

350
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,600
whole system stack you guys know that

351
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,639
already and so it's about working as a

352
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,040
full community to see what's next it's

353
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,320
also about thinking about maybe at the

354
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,660
same time it's a chance to reinvent some

355
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,760
things so for example the traditional

356
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,019
instruction set architecture

357
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,459
abstractions that form the hardware

358
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:17,459
software contract for a long time

359
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:20,760
um they are very serviceable but they

360
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,380
didn't do the best job that they could

361
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:26,160
on things like security and reliability

362
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,639
we could do better there and we saw

363
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:31,560
examples like Specter and meltdown where

364
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,920
our inability to really sort of navigate

365
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,540
what was happening at that Hardware

366
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,639
software interface for real really

367
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,100
affected our ability to to ensure the

368
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,320
security of systems you can come up with

369
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,560
other examples now around portability

370
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,459
increasingly we're seeing so many

371
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:50,579
accelerators on chips that the notion of

372
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:52,860
the old Hardware software contracts are

373
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,380
really out of date

374
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:58,139
AI digging in a little bit more AI today

375
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:00,540
draws from an all of size inflection

376
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:04,139
point and so AI algorithms great but it

377
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:06,600
shouldn't be like AI is one part of the

378
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,279
world and systems is another part of the

379
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:11,339
world AI is where it is because of

380
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:14,339
systems right uh building the systems

381
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:17,820
that have let AI scale and likewise AI

382
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,100
is broadly fueling advances across many

383
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,079
aspects of our field and so it really is

384
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,480
transcendent and sort of permeating many

385
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,120
aspects of what all of us do as opposed

386
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,620
to being kind of this thing off on the

387
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,779
side

388
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:32,720
um third one designing beneficial

389
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,860
socio-technical systems digging in a

390
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,380
little bit more there we've always been

391
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,600
a socio-technical field think about our

392
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,459
Roots decades ago uh we

393
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:47,100
a lot of early American Computing was in

394
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,740
designing devices to do missile

395
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,940
trajectories that's pretty

396
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,220
socio-technical right so we should

397
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,959
acknowledge that we have always been

398
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,360
socio-technical but now it's harder and

399
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,459
harder to opt out right and so we need

400
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,579
to think as systems designers and as

401
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:04,440
computer scientists and as humans about

402
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,600
what are the ethics and the implications

403
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,380
of what we do and how can we steer the

404
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,320
work we do in order to increase benefits

405
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,880
and put guard rails on some of the

406
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,100
concerns and this is super broad right

407
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,279
so for some folks this might be about

408
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:23,040
fairness and AI but for other folks this

409
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,959
might be about ensuring better and more

410
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,420
affordable connectivity across the whole

411
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,519
world so there's different ways that

412
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,079
this tagline of beneficial

413
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:34,800
socio-technical systems can come in

414
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,920
I wanted to talk about a few programs

415
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,019
not that you'll all be sort of writing

416
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:42,480
proposals in the next five days to all

417
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,600
of them but to give examples of the

418
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,100
breadth of things that we work on both

419
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,160
within size and across NSF so one

420
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,920
example of a new program and it speaks

421
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,079
to the first of those inflection points

422
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:57,000
the seismic shift at the end of Moore's

423
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Law is a program that is NSF wide called

424
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,120
future of semiconductors or fuse

425
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,439
deadline in five days if you're feeling

426
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:05,699
perky tonight

427
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:08,699
um and the idea here is to acknowledge

428
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:10,319
this sort of

429
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:14,280
a multi-topic impact that the end of

430
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,199
Moore's law is having and to encourage

431
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:18,179
co-design across different topic areas

432
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:19,859
so this is about getting computer

433
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:22,799
systems folks working with uh computer

434
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,959
hardware folks working with materials

435
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,140
folks to think about co-design how might

436
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,360
different CMOS plus X how might

437
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,460
different photonics Technologies how

438
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,679
might different DNA storage Technologies

439
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,780
impact systems design in a way that we

440
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,940
can team up around and work on together

441
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,520
and so the first set of so-called

442
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,280
teaming grants that's the deadline in

443
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,160
five days and then we aspire to have

444
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,900
sort of larger grants available in

445
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,120
future fiscal Years and we're also

446
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,919
working on industry Partnerships towards

447
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:54,600
this as well

448
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,600
second thing is about uh Transcendence

449
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,240
of AI I think I went through some of

450
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,179
this so I'll sort of speed up

451
00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:04,919
what's next you know I I think what I

452
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:07,320
always like to say is uh that your

453
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,820
community plays a strong role in

454
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,380
navigating this transition and I say

455
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,059
that to every Community for full

456
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:13,559
disclosure so

457
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:14,940
um you know we all are going to play a

458
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,559
strong role in navigating the transition

459
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,200
and in thinking about safety security

460
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,200
robustness and so forth of AI systems I

461
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,299
think the systems community and the ATC

462
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:25,500
community

463
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,600
you guys are rock stars thinking about

464
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,240
this uh across many different dimensions

465
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,400
of what we do and so it's time to bring

466
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,679
that into to AI

467
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:37,020
um even more so

468
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:40,679
uh Vision so uh we within our stuff we

469
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:42,240
are starting to call this the bubble

470
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,900
chart so NSF started funding about two

471
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,059
years ago the national AI research

472
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:50,880
institutes so these are a network now of

473
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,299
18 different large-scale uh Investments

474
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:57,179
That NSF has made each investment is 20

475
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:59,820
million dollars over five years it's led

476
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,039
by one University with about 10 other

477
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:04,740
universities as funded partners and a

478
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,660
bunch of different industry uh

479
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,240
collaborators as well so each AI

480
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,820
Institute is one of these sort of red

481
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,520
solar systems that you see here there

482
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,160
are 18 of those AI institutes now with a

483
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,799
funded footprint in 40 States so this is

484
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:21,299
big and it's happened pretty quickly

485
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:23,100
just in a couple years and we're working

486
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,039
on making the funding towards uh the

487
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,919
next round of these AI institutes so

488
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:30,539
there will be more of these red solar

489
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:32,820
systems but if you think about them as

490
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:37,200
kind of a a a network then

491
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,600
this bubble chart is about building out

492
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,340
the rest around that so how do you

493
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,160
connect those to the systems Community

494
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,179
to other AI researchers and how do you

495
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:50,460
sort of pull in the broadest uh

496
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,380
cross-section of Workforce into this

497
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,539
area that's what this network of

498
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:57,059
Network's vision is about so one of the

499
00:19:57,059 --> 00:19:59,700
things that we just funded I think this

500
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,520
week is the big blue oval so-called

501
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,440
virtual organization that's intended to

502
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,640
get all of those 18 AI institutes at

503
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,080
literally I think it's over 100

504
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,780
universities in 40 states to talk to

505
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,000
each other frequently in order to kind

506
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,220
of build up a full community around them

507
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,260
so that's funded

508
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,280
um

509
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,039
and in place uh

510
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,860
so the red the red blobs exist and more

511
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,780
red blobs are coming the blue oval

512
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:31,620
exists and more is coming this notion of

513
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,500
MSI ERI connector sorry that's a lot of

514
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,220
acronyms but uh it's a minority serving

515
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:41,160
institutions are in the U.S a category

516
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,000
of Institutions with uh High minority

517
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,520
populations and a and a desire to make

518
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,780
sure that we reach out to those

519
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,940
communities effectively and so we're

520
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,500
looking at different mechanisms to

521
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,840
connect them better into these AI

522
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,720
Institute efforts

523
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,580
uh in addition

524
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,880
NSF has a new directorate a counterpart

525
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,559
director called Technology Innovation

526
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,360
and Partnerships or the tip directorate

527
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,179
it was announced in March and this new

528
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:12,000
directorate is working on Regional uh

529
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,620
Innovation engines and different sort of

530
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:17,580
economic uh aspects of what comes out of

531
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:21,240
American Labs and so we're working with

532
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,820
the tip directorate on different efforts

533
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,580
there the last part of this diagram are

534
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:30,240
the international AI Partnerships and we

535
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,600
have a set of efforts there as well so

536
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,740
one of those efforts in in NSF speak we

537
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,780
put out Dear colleague letters or dcl's

538
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,220
when we want the community to know about

539
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:45,000
something so the upper uh Wright DCL was

540
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,240
a set of opportunities for these AI

541
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,280
institutes these red blobs to

542
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,860
collaborate internationally and we're

543
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,159
now in the process of having reviewed

544
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,039
um a couple dozen of those proposals and

545
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,500
we're making funding Awards to let each

546
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,299
one of these AI institutes essentially

547
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:05,039
collaborate internationally as they've

548
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,960
proposed and so you'll see those coming

549
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,840
out over the next month or two lower

550
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,860
left

551
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,320
is an opportunity that we'd love to

552
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,659
actually see more folks come in on

553
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:17,700
because we put it out there in December

554
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,980
and we're waiting for it to pick up

555
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,440
steam and that is I realize that is not

556
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,919
an effective or catchy title um

557
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,020
special guidelines blah blah blah okay

558
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,240
what is that that is if you're in the

559
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,480
U.S and your collaborators in Canada and

560
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,659
you work in areas that are broadly Ai

561
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:39,299
and Quantum but that can include systems

562
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:41,700
aspects of either AI or Quantum you can

563
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,200
write a proposal you write a single

564
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,760
proposal together

565
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,620
you submit it

566
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,559
the U.S it goes through a single review

567
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:52,200
process the US person if funded gets

568
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,240
funded out of NSF funds the Canadian

569
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,159
person if funded gets funded out of

570
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,919
Canadian funds so this is an opportunity

571
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:02,100
long overdue in my opinion for U.S and

572
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,320
Canadian researchers to work together it

573
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,059
happens to be around Ai and Quantum

574
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:07,559
right now but I think there's an awful

575
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:10,020
lot of sort of breadth to how that gets

576
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,120
viewed and we haven't seen as many

577
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,280
proposals into that as we expected so

578
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,280
that's both about kind of AI but also

579
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,720
about these International opportunities

580
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,059
and I'll talk more about them as as this

581
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:23,460
talk proceeds designing beneficial

582
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,400
socio-technical systems as I said many

583
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,620
things to many people tons of things

584
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,559
related to the osdi and ATC community

585
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:33,900
and the picture there is from a

586
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,240
connectivity award that was made about

587
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,120
close to five years ago now there's

588
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,740
obviously tremendous range in how this

589
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,500
gets viewed it's core systems research

590
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,659
to use inspired it's cyber physical it's

591
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:47,100
networking

592
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,559
um it's fairness it's Ai and in general

593
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:51,179
it's about giving

594
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:54,059
our research Community the opportunity

595
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:58,320
to to reshape what we do in order to

596
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,419
sort of put the societal benefits up

597
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:04,380
front and bake in these Notions of uh

598
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,820
sort of fairness trust and security

599
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,480
throughout

600
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,039
one example

601
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:15,000
of a place where I think there are

602
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,559
tremendous benefit tremendous

603
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,120
opportunities in terms of beneficial

604
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,760
socio-technical systems is about the

605
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,559
role of computing in our whole community

606
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,140
in sustainability and climate issues

607
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,000
which are sort of a grand challenge for

608
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,320
us as a planet right so I talk about

609
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,900
this with these two arrows I talk about

610
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,140
this as a bi-directional set of topics

611
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:40,620
on the left is about us cleaning up our

612
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,419
own house it's about making Computing

613
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:44,820
itself more sustainable and there's an

614
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,140
awful lot of work through your community

615
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,559
already that has done this

616
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:53,280
I think you know as I I sort of have

617
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,020
done power efficient Computing in the

618
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,159
past and one of the things I love about

619
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,700
NSF is when program officers call you on

620
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,900
it and they say yeah Market power

621
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,000
efficiency is a part of it but it isn't

622
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,039
the only thing right uh the full life

623
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,559
cycle of sustainability is Way Beyond

624
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:10,200
power efficiency it's into E-Waste it's

625
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,600
into the energy required for the design

626
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,640
and Fabrication process of our Computing

627
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,700
systems so that's the left and we can

628
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,640
certainly work on that focus on that NSF

629
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,960
has had

630
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,360
um programs specifically on that we've

631
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,240
had a DCL dear colleague letter inviting

632
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,860
proposals on that you can see the URL

633
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,720
down at the bottom so there's a bunch of

634
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,360
places in which we're working on this we

635
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,500
actually have one partnership with

636
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,600
VMware so thank you to VMware I know

637
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,779
there's VMware folks in the house

638
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:40,980
specifically on sustainable digital

639
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:43,799
infrastructure so that's the left to

640
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:45,200
right arrow

641
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,260
the right to left arrow is about the the

642
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,539
countervailing which is let's use the

643
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:53,640
Computing we have to to work on

644
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,220
sustainability so as a driver for

645
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,799
computational modeling adaptation and

646
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,320
mitigation we have programs like the

647
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,440
Civic Innovation Challenge

648
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,940
um which is a program that invites

649
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,059
communities regions not research

650
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:11,520
communities towns to come forward with

651
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,140
their problems many of which have to do

652
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,779
with mitigating natural hazards like

653
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:17,520
extreme weather events flooding and so

654
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,039
forth and to bring their researcher

655
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:22,380
friends with them but it's framed as

656
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,059
communities first and strong Community

657
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:26,039
engagement so if you have ideas for work

658
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:28,559
where you want to do systems work in the

659
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,960
context of an actual Community

660
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,480
benefiting check out Civic Innovation

661
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,520
Challenge and the other ones here as

662
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,480
well

663
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,299
so we go both directions and there's a

664
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:41,220
huge opportunity space here and a huge

665
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,600
need

666
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,580
so those were the three technical themes

667
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,559
I wanted to talk a little bit about some

668
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,360
cross-cutting themes as well and I

669
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,240
should say that some fraction of you

670
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,640
might actually be U.S academic

671
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,020
researchers who could sit down tonight

672
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,940
and write a proposal some fraction of

673
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,340
you might be students who could

674
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,200
encourage your professor to sit down and

675
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,000
write a proposal but others of you are

676
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,679
from elsewhere in the world or from

677
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:07,440
industry and so for you this isn't so

678
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,960
much about this DCL or that solicitation

679
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,120
but it is about starting a conversation

680
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,059
about what is needed for our field and

681
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:16,559
where we ought to be going and I'm happy

682
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,260
to feel during q a other ideas you have

683
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,340
about that

684
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,760
so back to this so three technical

685
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,620
themes but really there's a bunch of

686
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,480
cross-cutting themes that cut across

687
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,860
this and I'm going to talk about two of

688
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,020
them today that I think

689
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,940
ought to be very near and dear to the

690
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,220
hearts of many folks in this room so one

691
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,779
is about research resources and

692
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:38,640
infrastructure and the other is about

693
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,659
people

694
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:42,419
so research resources and infrastructure

695
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:43,440
first

696
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,679
and foremost you know I can remember it

697
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:49,380
was just three years ago I was in a it

698
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,659
was before I was at NSF and I was in a

699
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:53,640
meeting I won't say where and someone

700
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,679
said well what does Computing research

701
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,419
doesn't need infrastructure we're all on

702
00:27:57,419 --> 00:27:58,919
our laptops that's all we need I was

703
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:01,380
like are you kidding me

704
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,539
um so I want to take those three themes

705
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:06,020
and I want to talk about what

706
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,159
researchers need to actually make

707
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,620
Headway on those themes so for the post

708
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,480
more you know

709
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,659
we need more access to semiconductor Fab

710
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:19,380
facilities most of our Hardware work is

711
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,779
being done in simulation and that's not

712
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:24,419
good we need more experiential learning

713
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:26,039
for our students we need more

714
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:27,960
experiential learning for our faculty

715
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:32,340
and parts of U.S federal funding have

716
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,980
been okay about getting folks access to

717
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,260
Fab facilities DARPA I think has been a

718
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,240
good leader in that that's another our

719
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,059
sister agency but NSF has not

720
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:44,340
traditionally helped its researchers Fab

721
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,080
things and we need to do better on that

722
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,720
we also are working hard on things like

723
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,700
access to Cutting Edge Next Generation

724
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:54,360
Technologies access to cloud computing

725
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,039
Cloud connected Quantum Computing

726
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:58,080
systems is one example there

727
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,799
AI we hear from AI researchers all the

728
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:04,320
time that they don't have the resources

729
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,480
they need to do their research at scale

730
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,659
in Academia and so what do we see uh one

731
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:12,299
thing we see is a brain drain out to

732
00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:14,159
Industry and out to other places where

733
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:15,900
there's more data available and more

734
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,580
compute Cycles available and we need to

735
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,700
turn that around

736
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,440
and and so one of the things I want to

737
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,000
stop and highlight here is the degree to

738
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,700
which data is infrastructure for our

739
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,340
community and so thinking about how to

740
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,899
store data how to Federate data and how

741
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:32,399
to make it available to a broad set of

742
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,679
researchers is really important and then

743
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:36,600
on the socio-technical systems really

744
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,159
thinking about communities as living

745
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,140
Labs thinking about what are the

746
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,700
different sensing and connectivity

747
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,960
platforms that we could make available

748
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,940
to the community

749
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:48,480
to uh to broadly allow people to work on

750
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,820
this and so the the way I view this is

751
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,039
some of you might have some of this many

752
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,360
of you probably don't have enough of

753
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,600
this and there's folks who aren't at

754
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,700
this conference today who don't really

755
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,320
know that they have access to any of

756
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,320
this and it's our job at NSF to make

757
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,899
things broadly available remember that

758
00:30:05,899 --> 00:30:09,840
373 universities that's beyond the folks

759
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,419
in this room and and then some

760
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:15,960
so the next few slides are really a menu

761
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,899
of things that we do fund we do offer

762
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:24,299
and uh a plea to please use them uh know

763
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:26,399
that they are essentially an extension

764
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,679
of your own lab facilities and they're

765
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:31,260
available for you so one example is the

766
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,940
platforms for advanced Wireless research

767
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,880
or power test beds these are intended to

768
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,460
enable at scale experimentation there's

769
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,980
four of them now uh you can see them

770
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,679
listed there this is a 100 million

771
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,480
dollar public-private partnership so

772
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,600
this is NSF leading

773
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,760
but the Department of Defense the U.S

774
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,559
department of Agriculture and 35

775
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,260
companies are providing in-kind

776
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:58,440
resources so if you are curious about

777
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,100
doing at scale mimo experiments or Edge

778
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,980
to Cloud experiments powder might be a

779
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,140
part of your experimental infrastructure

780
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,539
and I will say that these four test bids

781
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:14,520
are available to academics worldwide so

782
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,980
if you're in the U.S great but if you're

783
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,419
International these are also available

784
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:21,419
to you on the far right is the newest

785
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:24,059
Power test bed which is about affordable

786
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:26,340
rural Broadband is being stood up by

787
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:29,720
Iowa State University so this is one

788
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,200
advancedwireless.org is where you can

789
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,000
find out more information about getting

790
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,140
involved in using these

791
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,299
uh this is my happily jumbled crowded

792
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:42,240
diagram and I say happily because if it

793
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,740
weren't crowded that would mean we

794
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,960
didn't have as many resources so the

795
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,059
crowding is a good thing

796
00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:48,840
um

797
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,580
what are these These are the different

798
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,799
nsf-funded research resources and test

799
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,320
feds the green that you see the sort of

800
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,299
lime green are those power test beds

801
00:31:57,299 --> 00:32:00,480
that I already mentioned uh in Salt Lake

802
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,880
and Iowa and so forth so I already

803
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,320
talked about them

804
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,820
the uh gray down here Frontera that's

805
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,880
the largest super computer on a U.S

806
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,559
academic campus maybe the largest

807
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:16,500
supercomputer on any academic campus I I

808
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,880
lose track of whether that's still a

809
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,220
true statement Frontera contributed

810
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,080
about 60 million Cycles towards that

811
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,960
black hole image that you saw at the

812
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,760
beginning of my talk and Frontera also

813
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,220
contributed more resources than any

814
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,140
other machine on Earth to the covid-19

815
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,720
HPC Consortium that was a public-private

816
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,419
international partnership stood up to

817
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:39,000
lend compute resources to what we were

818
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,260
going through over the past two and a

819
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:43,080
half years so that's great I want to

820
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:47,460
focus in particular on three things that

821
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:50,039
are in red here and that when I told

822
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:52,320
people at NSF that I was going to ATC

823
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,179
and osdi they said oh you need to talk

824
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:56,399
about these three and so this is partly

825
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,200
to say thank you and it's also partly to

826
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,840
say hey you guys need to use this more

827
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,039
so these are the different Cloud

828
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:03,960
resources that are part of our funded

829
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,080
portfolio and so chameleon and Cloud lab

830
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,779
I want to say thank you the pis have

831
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:12,179
published about them here at these

832
00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:15,600
conferences and I believe that osdi has

833
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,820
used them for artifact evaluation as

834
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,919
well and so thank you these are

835
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,380
essentially infrastructure they're test

836
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,720
beds that let researchers have bare

837
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,539
metal access to Cloud experimentation

838
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:31,159
platforms that let you do your work

839
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:34,500
in a way that is uh

840
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:37,679
out in the cloud and yet uh gives you

841
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,539
more sort of direct control over the

842
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:40,919
systems than if you just use the

843
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:43,260
commercial Cloud so thank you to the pis

844
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,360
who stood those up but we could still

845
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,279
use more users it would be great to see

846
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,860
more and more of the systems conferences

847
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,380
where the work was done on these

848
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,840
platforms and so the two URLs in the

849
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,700
middle and on the right at the bottom

850
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,919
are how to learn more about those

851
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:00,000
platforms

852
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,600
uh the third one Cloud bank and and I

853
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,159
recognize that there's a lot of

854
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:08,040
different names and they're fairly

855
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,800
similar but Cloud bank is not about bare

856
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,179
metal access Cloud bank is about

857
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:14,580
essentially being a front door to the

858
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:18,139
commercial Cloud uh Amazon web services

859
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:21,000
Microsoft Azure and and so on and so

860
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,540
forth and so Cloud bank is a system in

861
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:28,440
which uh U.S researchers can get Cloud

862
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,500
credits as part of writing a proposal

863
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,780
and then those Cloud credits go straight

864
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,940
to their Cloud bank account and then

865
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,739
your students can use those commercial

866
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:41,540
Cloud resources as they normally would

867
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:45,239
but essentially at a discount uh because

868
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:47,460
there's no indirect cost in the way the

869
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,859
the resources move around Cloud bank is

870
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:51,800
about three four years old now

871
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:56,159
it saw relatively slow uptake and we

872
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,780
think it's because you had to ask for

873
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,160
those resources when you wrote a

874
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,619
proposal and then who really thinks

875
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:03,240
about their Cloud resources three years

876
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,800
in advance that's not what the cloud is

877
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,140
about right so in the past six months

878
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,420
we've actually changed Cloud bank so

879
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,700
that you can ask for these uh

880
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,920
supplements essentially whenever you

881
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,640
want

882
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,560
so

883
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,619
you should use cloud bank it's in

884
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:22,560
various size solicitations

885
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,599
I know that when we put out a

886
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:27,300
solicitation the typical proposal reads

887
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,119
maybe the first page you read to the

888
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:32,700
deadline the budget amount and how many

889
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,640
of these things you're allowed to submit

890
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,140
there's another 10 pages after that that

891
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,480
no one ever reads but I promise you that

892
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,760
cloud bank is in a bunch of that text

893
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,060
that you never read so it's there

894
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:48,260
uh as I said there's no indirect cost so

895
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:52,260
if you are typically as an academic

896
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:55,020
paying with a credit card for your

897
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,780
students to use commercial Cloud you are

898
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,180
often paying out of an account that is

899
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,339
charging you indirect cost and so if you

900
00:36:02,339 --> 00:36:04,140
use this Cloud Bank approach you're

901
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,780
probably going to save half

902
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,300
and it's now more Nimble than ever the

903
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,060
cloud Bank supplement DCL is the link

904
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,160
there and you can request Cloud band

905
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,160
credits essentially anytime you want so

906
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,440
try it it's actually seen a huge uptick

907
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,060
in the four months since we put out this

908
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:24,060
DCL great

909
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,820
people we don't go anywhere without

910
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:27,780
people

911
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,040
and

912
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:29,640
[Music]

913
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,359
um

914
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:34,460
this is so important for what we do

915
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,160
and I think I want to stop here and I

916
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,680
want to say you know uh here's my quiz

917
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,599
question I sometimes put the graph

918
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:45,480
actually into my talk but my quiz

919
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,300
question to you folks is when do you

920
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,480
think was the peak percentage of women

921
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:55,579
receiving undergraduate degrees in

922
00:36:55,579 --> 00:36:57,960
Computing in America

923
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,660
so you might think that the peak

924
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:03,740
percentage is basically right now

925
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:07,020
maybe it's been going up up you might be

926
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,520
an optimist and think you know it's at

927
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,320
least going up and so the peak would be

928
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,320
now you might have some other opinion

929
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,780
um I usually stop here and I don't know

930
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,380
how far back you can see my gray hair

931
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:21,240
but for those of you in the back I am 58

932
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,400
years old and I have gray hair and I am

933
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:27,300
your Peak the peak was 1985. I got my

934
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,720
college degree in 1986. uh it was around

935
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,780
30 percent women back then it dropped

936
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,220
precipitously

937
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:38,400
uh it's coming back up it hasn't hit

938
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,680
that Peak again yet I would love to

939
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:44,099
leave NSF having surpassed that Peak

940
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:45,839
um but even if we did

941
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,119
there's a whole bunch of other ways in

942
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:49,740
which we need to think about our Fields

943
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:52,859
inclusion in terms of

944
00:37:52,859 --> 00:37:55,740
uh how we retain folks in the field how

945
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,079
we sort of create a welcoming Community

946
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,359
how we think about many different

947
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:03,380
dimensions to who we are whether it's

948
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:06,060
demographic information socioeconomic

949
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:09,480
status uh Geographic inclusion and so

950
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:13,619
forth uh and so this is about that not

951
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:15,660
because I'm a woman speaker and I want

952
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,460
more women in Computing but because

953
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,040
there's a whole lot of ways in which we

954
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,540
aren't going to move on these societal

955
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:24,599
challenges if we're only taking about 30

956
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:27,900
percent of the world's Talent uh with us

957
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:31,020
on this journey right and so

958
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,820
um that's what this is about this is

959
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:35,160
about being able to do the best science

960
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,980
by taking the full set of talents with

961
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,820
us on this journey

962
00:38:40,859 --> 00:38:45,180
so what NSF uh envisioned about 12 years

963
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:47,460
ago and has implemented over the past

964
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,740
five years

965
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:54,900
is a new effort to ask that everyone who

966
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:58,020
submits to size everyone who submits

967
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,780
size proposals at the level of 600k or

968
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:03,599
more actually actively engages with us

969
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,240
in broadening participation in Computing

970
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:10,320
and in particular uh we require every

971
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,260
proposer we call them pis to offer a

972
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,940
broadening participation in Computing

973
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:18,480
plan or a bpc plan for proposals into

974
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,079
our topic areas and the idea is if if we

975
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,720
need everyone involved if we need

976
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,700
everyone to move the needle then we need

977
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,380
to engage everyone in the in the

978
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:31,140
practice of doing that broadening

979
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:34,680
um but we know that if we ask a 20 000

980
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:38,339
pis to submit proposals with bpc plans

981
00:39:38,339 --> 00:39:40,740
without any coordination we might get

982
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,359
some great ideas but it would be kind of

983
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:46,500
a jumble and so uh what we have sought

984
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,560
to do is to align ideas better and to

985
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,300
offer those who feel like they don't

986
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,040
have full expertise on these kinds of

987
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,260
efforts a little bit of scaffolding and

988
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,920
help and so in particular

989
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,020
uh our goal is to have a set of

990
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,760
department and campus level resources

991
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,460
and a set of national level resources so

992
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,500
that individual pis aren't just on their

993
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,960
own talking about bpc but rather

994
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,700
individual researchers are plugging into

995
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,200
something bigger than themselves either

996
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,960
on their campus or nationally

997
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,540
and so what NSF has done is fund that

998
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:22,079
scaffolding so we require the plans and

999
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:23,640
then we fund the scaffolding to help

1000
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,200
people feel like their plans can be

1001
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:30,000
effective so bpcnet.org is a URL you can

1002
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,920
go check it out it has a menu of things

1003
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,660
that you could do to broaden

1004
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,640
participation in Computing yourself or

1005
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,740
with your colleagues or with your campus

1006
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:40,619
it also has a set of people who it

1007
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:43,079
floors me they volunteer their time to

1008
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:46,020
help you make a better bpc plan

1009
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,839
through Consulting office hours through

1010
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:50,579
workshops that help departments think

1011
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:52,560
about what a campus bpc plan should look

1012
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,380
like and so forth and you have

1013
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,359
tremendous opportunities to tailor these

1014
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:59,579
to your local context every campus is

1015
00:40:59,579 --> 00:41:00,900
different every department is different

1016
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:04,859
there's ways to to to tailor as you see

1017
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:08,400
fit so this has been going on now as

1018
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,560
first a pilot for three years and now as

1019
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,339
a as a full-fledged we took the word

1020
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:16,140
pilot off of it it's simply something we

1021
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,599
ask for and we're watching the community

1022
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:20,940
get better and better at actually

1023
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,859
writing bpc plans that are meaningful

1024
00:41:22,859 --> 00:41:25,560
and then acting on them

1025
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:28,680
uh when I showed my slides to someone

1026
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,000
they said you need to say that there's

1027
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,560
money involved there's money available

1028
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,380
and so just like uh you can ask for

1029
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:37,619
cloud bank money anytime you want uh we

1030
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:38,760
want you to know that you can ask for

1031
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,880
bpc money essentially anytime you want

1032
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,380
uh there's a lot of words on this slide

1033
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:47,060
but I will just say that uh feel free to

1034
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,099
go to that

1035
00:41:49,099 --> 00:41:51,960
21-571 or go to your program officer for

1036
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,000
more information if you have ideas for

1037
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,440
something that you started out as part

1038
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,359
of a bpc plan and now you want to scale

1039
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:58,200
it up

1040
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,240
we want to help you and this is how we

1041
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,419
can

1042
00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:05,640
more just in case your summer looked a

1043
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:09,480
little too open more opportunities Q is

1044
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,280
Computing undergrad education you might

1045
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,320
say I don't teach that intro programming

1046
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,079
class I don't this is not for me

1047
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:17,280
um but what we're hearing is that

1048
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,720
there's an awful lot of people who are

1049
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,760
worried that our curricula are not

1050
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,740
keeping up with our technology Trends

1051
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,359
and a big place where people are worried

1052
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:26,640
about that is cloud computing Cloud

1053
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,060
programming and that is totally the ATC

1054
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:33,359
osdi wheelhouse right so we hear from

1055
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:36,480
industry that folks come out of Cs

1056
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,540
departments not having had enough or

1057
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:40,980
broad enough or rigorous enough

1058
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:44,160
experience in Cloud programming and one

1059
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,920
of the things that Q can let you do is

1060
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,960
to take the time and the effort to

1061
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,940
rethink what your cloud computing

1062
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:52,800
curricula looks like within your

1063
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,619
department and so we encourage you to

1064
00:42:55,619 --> 00:42:58,140
take a look and uh take a look at that

1065
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,359
it also asks you to think about things

1066
00:43:00,359 --> 00:43:02,460
like teams of schools working together

1067
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,140
so that once you take this effort to

1068
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,700
redo some part of your curriculum it has

1069
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,800
some scale impact beyond your own campus

1070
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,839
it asks for you to think about things

1071
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:11,880
like Ethics in competing ethics and

1072
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,560
curricula as well

1073
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,119
uh

1074
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:17,819
CS grad for us deadline closed on June

1075
00:43:17,819 --> 00:43:20,760
30th so one of the things that we see in

1076
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,200
the U.S is

1077
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,700
we have booming enrollments at the

1078
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:24,839
undergrad level

1079
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:27,900
uh but most of the folks who are

1080
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:30,599
undergrads in CS in America don't

1081
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:33,960
continue immediately or ever into

1082
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,660
advanced degree programs and

1083
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:38,280
to some degree that's awesome it means

1084
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,200
there's great job opportunities out

1085
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,640
there and they're going for it that's

1086
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:42,839
great

1087
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:45,780
um but we're worried about who's going

1088
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:48,660
to be the next generation of PhD level

1089
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,400
researchers in our field whether in

1090
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,339
Academia or elsewhere and so the goal of

1091
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:54,960
this is to increase the number and

1092
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,900
diversity of folks U.S citizen and

1093
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,460
permanent resident graduate students in

1094
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:02,280
Computing Fields so this is the second

1095
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,960
time that we've offered this fellowship

1096
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,960
program we offered it a year ago and we

1097
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,000
frankly got them we were worried that we

1098
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,859
would get so many responses that we

1099
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:12,420
wouldn't know what to do if 50 000

1100
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:15,119
students graduate a year we were worried

1101
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,160
they would all apply they didn't all

1102
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,500
apply

1103
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:21,000
did it again this year got double the

1104
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,859
applicants this year so that's great but

1105
00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:24,480
they still the numbers are quite low

1106
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,520
relative to the need and relative to the

1107
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,440
opportunity so for those of you who are

1108
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,240
familiar this is the same funding level

1109
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,099
as a quote unquote NSF graduate

1110
00:44:32,099 --> 00:44:33,540
Fellowship so three years of full

1111
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:35,880
funding what's distinct about it is

1112
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:38,339
twofold number one one it comes with a

1113
00:44:38,339 --> 00:44:40,020
year of mentoring before you start

1114
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:41,400
graduate school to help you know what

1115
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:45,000
graduate school is and to help you with

1116
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,500
your grad application

1117
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,619
and it comes with

1118
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:52,260
a hope that we're going to pull folks

1119
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:53,420
from

1120
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:57,240
industry back to back to Advanced degree

1121
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,099
programs so it's asking for folks who

1122
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:02,220
have graduated 2021 or earlier to come

1123
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:05,959
back into the academic pathways

1124
00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:10,280
one more so about five years ago

1125
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,740
in the heart of the metoo movement

1126
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:17,160
um NSF changed how we give out Awards

1127
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:20,520
and in particular NSF added what's

1128
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,859
called a terms and condition that goes

1129
00:45:22,859 --> 00:45:24,960
out with every award that we makes if

1130
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,599
you get a dollar from NSF it has this

1131
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,819
term and condition associated with it

1132
00:45:29,819 --> 00:45:32,339
which is that your University

1133
00:45:32,339 --> 00:45:34,740
needs to let NSF know

1134
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:37,520
if if something has happened

1135
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,780
that has put a researcher on

1136
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:42,079
administrative leave

1137
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:47,040
related to harassment of different types

1138
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,319
um in essence we know that it's not

1139
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:51,780
enough to recruit people into the field

1140
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:54,119
we need to make sure that it's safe for

1141
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:55,680
them to stay

1142
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,140
and productive for them to stay

1143
00:45:58,140 --> 00:45:59,819
and we don't want

1144
00:45:59,819 --> 00:46:03,740
our scarce dollars going to fund

1145
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:06,060
different kinds of power dynamics and

1146
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:07,260
harassment

1147
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:10,819
so we put this in place five years ago

1148
00:46:10,819 --> 00:46:14,339
and it's not the most fun part of my job

1149
00:46:14,339 --> 00:46:16,740
but I have watched it happen I have

1150
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:18,359
watched this kick in in different

1151
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:23,160
moments and I'm glad it exists because

1152
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,800
we need to make sure that it's safe for

1153
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,359
our students and for our early career

1154
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:29,099
faculty and frankly for people at all

1155
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:30,720
seniority levels to do their best

1156
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,520
science because it's not enough to

1157
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,800
recruit we also need to retain we need

1158
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:39,000
to cultivate careers so this was NSF

1159
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,280
step about five years ago I know that

1160
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,839
there's a lot of different efforts that

1161
00:46:42,839 --> 00:46:44,880
are going on within the community I know

1162
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,380
that one effort is getting kicked off

1163
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:49,740
here a survey related to to harassment

1164
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,560
and I would encourage you all to find

1165
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,540
out the URL for that survey and fill it

1166
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:55,740
out

1167
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:58,920
I'm not allowed to say that um

1168
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,660
as a federal employee but I'm just

1169
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,040
saying that as Market find the survey

1170
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,640
and fill it out

1171
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:08,460
great uh

1172
00:47:08,819 --> 00:47:10,980
slight shift in Gears I'm going to talk

1173
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:12,680
about some different International

1174
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:17,040
places where NSF has played a role so I

1175
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,660
mentioned this before I'll mention it

1176
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:20,640
again

1177
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,520
to be at NSF in March 2020 was really

1178
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,980
some of the most remarkable weeks of my

1179
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:29,780
life to watch a scientific Community

1180
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:33,060
ramp up efforts to help a global

1181
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:35,520
Challenge and one of the things that NSF

1182
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:39,180
did in March 2020 was co-lead with IBM

1183
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:41,940
and the U.S department of energy an

1184
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:43,680
international public-private Consortium

1185
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:47,400
to say hey Computing resources will

1186
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:51,000
probably help us understand SARS cov2 so

1187
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,619
let's get them out there for scientists

1188
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:56,760
to use as this progressed we ended up

1189
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,040
with 40 Consortium members around the

1190
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,680
world 136

1191
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,680
000 compute nodes available NSF was the

1192
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:08,700
primary contributor of resources the

1193
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,200
the

1194
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:11,240
um

1195
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:15,720
2020 and 2021 Gordon Bell prizes in the

1196
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,079
covid-19 special Gordon Bell prize area

1197
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:19,700
both

1198
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:22,200
received compute resources out of this

1199
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,000
Consortium so this is one example where

1200
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,520
it's pretty amazing to be a part of

1201
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,619
something that can sort of spin up

1202
00:48:28,619 --> 00:48:31,700
efforts at this level

1203
00:48:32,099 --> 00:48:34,200
I'm going to skip some of this I I

1204
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,119
wanted to talk about some International

1205
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:38,339
partnership examples just to give a

1206
00:48:38,339 --> 00:48:40,140
sense of what we do with our sister

1207
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:42,960
agencies around the world so one

1208
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,880
international example on a particular

1209
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,500
topic area is called collaborative

1210
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,599
research and computational Neuroscience

1211
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:54,240
or crcns NSF leads a many country effort

1212
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,700
around this topic area that has been

1213
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,220
extraordinarily effective at bringing

1214
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,260
together researchers so when this

1215
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:04,500
started I am told that neuroscientists

1216
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,300
basically didn't talk to Computing

1217
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:07,619
people at all they were two separate

1218
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:08,940
worlds and so the goal was to bring

1219
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:11,339
compute and Neuroscience together in the

1220
00:49:11,339 --> 00:49:12,900
process we brought a lot of countries

1221
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,220
together and you can see the full list

1222
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:15,599
there

1223
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:18,060
um and it's now at the point where over

1224
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:19,859
half of the proposals that we receive

1225
00:49:19,859 --> 00:49:22,140
into this program at NSF have an

1226
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:23,880
international collaboration component

1227
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,280
associated with them another long-term

1228
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:29,280
effort of the sort is Wi-Fi us uh

1229
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,920
Finland and the U.S uh collaborating for

1230
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,140
over 10 years on a range of Wireless

1231
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:39,300
networking and iot research and uh we

1232
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:43,140
now have just in the past month uh

1233
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:45,839
a humble web page web pages are not NSF

1234
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:48,119
strong point all of that but we do have

1235
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:50,040
a humble web page that lists the

1236
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:51,480
different International opportunities

1237
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:54,240
and it's it's something where there's a

1238
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,220
lot of effort on expanding that list and

1239
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:58,319
broadening that list so if you have

1240
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:00,119
ideas or if you have experiences you

1241
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:01,440
want to relate I'd be happy to hear

1242
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,180
about them

1243
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:06,780
so with that I'll end where I began that

1244
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:09,119
um it's it's been extraordinary to kind

1245
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:12,000
of jump over to the other side and uh

1246
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,319
see how a funding agency can help uh get

1247
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:17,819
trees planted

1248
00:50:17,819 --> 00:50:20,160
um you guys have an awful lot of uh

1249
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,740
acorns in your pocket and our goal is to

1250
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:23,760
try to make sure that some of those

1251
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,819
acorns become oak trees so with that

1252
00:50:26,819 --> 00:50:28,440
thanks very much and I'd be happy to

1253
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,160
field some questions
